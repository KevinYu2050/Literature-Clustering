PREFACE.
The present text-book is a new-modeling and rewriting of Swinton's
  Word-Analysis, first published in 1871. It has grown out of a
  large amount of testimony to the effect that the older book, while
  valuable as a manual of methods, in the hands of teachers, is deficient
  in practice-work for pupils.
This testimony dictated a double procedure: first, to retain the old
  methods; secondly, to add an adequate amount of new
  matter.
Accordingly, in the present manual, the few Latin roots and
  derivatives, with the exercises thereon, have been retained—under
  "Part II.: The Latin Element"—as simply a method of study.1 There have then been
  added, in "Division II.: Abbreviated Latin Derivatives," no fewer than
  two hundred and twenty Latin root-words with their most important English
  offshoots. In order to concentrate into the limited available space so
  large an amount of new matter, it was requisite to devise a novel mode of
  indicating the English derivatives. What this mode is, teachers will see
  in the section, pages 50-104. The author trusts that it will prove well
  suited to class-room work, and in many other ways interesting and
  valuable: should it not, a good deal of labor, both of the lamp and of
  the file, will have been misplaced.
To one matter of detail in connection with the Latin and Greek
  derivatives, the author wishes to call special attention: the Latin and
  the Greek roots are, as key-words, given in this book in the form of the
  present infinitive,—the present indicative and the supine
  being, of course, added. For this there is one sufficient justification,
  to wit: that the present infinitive is the form in which a Latin or a
  Greek root is always given in Webster and other received lexicographic
  authorities. It is a curious fact, that, in all the school etymologies,
  the present indicative should have been given as the root, and is
  explicable only from the accident that it is the key-form in the Latin
  dictionaries. The change into conformity with our English dictionaries
  needs no defense, and will probably hereafter be imitated by all authors
  of school etymologies.
In this compilation the author has followed, in the main, the last
  edition of Webster's Unabridged, the etymologies in which carry the
  authoritative sanction of Dr. Mahn; but reference has constantly been had
  to the works of Wedgwood, Latham, and Haldeman, as also to the "English
  Etymology" of Dr. James Douglass, to whom the author is specially
  indebted in the Greek and Anglo-Saxon sections.

WORD-ANALYSIS.

PART I.—INTRODUCTION.
I.—ELEMENTS OF THE ENGLISH VOCABULARY.
1. Etymology2 is the study which treats of the derivation
  of words,—that is, of their structure and history.
2. English etymology, or word-analysis, treats of the
  derivation of English words.
3. The vocabulary3 of a language is the whole body of words in
  that language. Hence the English vocabulary consists of all the words in
  the English language.
I.  The complete study of any language comprises two distinct
  inquiries,—the study of the grammar of the language, and the
  study of its vocabulary. Word-analysis has to do exclusively with
  the vocabulary.
II. The term "etymology" as used in grammar must be carefully
  distinguished from "etymology" in the sense of word-analysis. Grammatical
  etymology treats solely of the grammatical changes in words, and does not
  concern itself with their derivation; historical etymology treats of the
  structure, composition, and history of words. Thus the relation of
  loves, loving, loved to the verb love is a matter of
  grammatical etmology; but the relation of lover, lovely, or
  loveliness to love is a matter of historical
  etymology.
III. The English vocabulary is very extensive, as is shown by
  the fact that in Webster's Unabridged Dictionary there are nearly 100,000
  words. But it should be observed that 3,000 or 4,000 serve all the
  ordinary purposes of oral and written communication. The Old Testament
  contains 5,642 words; Milton uses about 8,000; and Shakespeare, whose
  vocabulary is more extensive than that of any other English writer,
  employs no more than 15,000 words.
4. The principal elements of the English vocabulary are
  words of Anglo-Saxon and of Latin or French-Latin origin.
5. Anglo-Saxon is the earliest form of English. The whole of
  the grammar of our language, and the most largely used part of its
  vocabulary, are Anglo-Saxon.
I. Anglo-Saxon belongs to the Low German4 division of the
  Teutonic stock of languages. Its relations to the other languages of
  Europe—all of which are classed together as the Aryan, or
  Indo-European family of languages—may be seen from the following
  table:—

Indo-EuropeanFamily.
CELTIC STOCK
as Welsh, Gaelic.


SLAVONIC STOCK
as Russian.


CLASSIC STOCK
Greek


Latin
Italian.Spanish.French, etc.


TEUTONIC STOCK
 Scandinavian:
as Swedish.


 German
High Ger.:
as Modern German.


Low Ger.:
as Anglo-Saxon.


II. The term "Anglo-Saxon" is derived from the names Angles and
  Saxons, two North German tribes who, in the fifth century A.D.,
  invaded Britain, conquered the native Britons, and possessed themselves
  of the land, which they called England, that is, Angle-land. The Britons
  spoke a Celtic language, best represented by modern Welsh. Some British
  words were adopted into Anglo-Saxon, and still continue in our
  language.
6. The Latin element in the English vocabulary consists
  of a large number of words of Latin origin, adopted directly into English
  at various periods.
The principal periods, during which Latin words were brought
  directly into English are:—
1. At the introduction of Christianity into England by the
  Latin Catholic missionaries, A.D. 596.
2. At the revival of classical learning in the sixteenth
  century.
3. By modern writers.
7. The French-Latin element in the English language
  consists of French words, first largely introduced into English by the
  Norman-French who conquered England in the eleventh century, A.D.
I. French, like Italian, Spanish, and Portuguese, is
  substantially Latin, but Latin considerably altered by loss of
  grammatical forms and by other changes. This language the Norman-French
  invaders brought with them into England, and they continued to use it for
  more than two centuries after the Conquest. Yet, as they were not so
  numerous as the native population, the old Anglo-Saxon finally prevailed,
  though with an immense infusion of French words.
II. French-Latin words—that is, Latin words introduced
  through the French—can often be readily distinguished by their
  being more changed in form than the Latin terms directly introduced into
  our language. Thus—



Latin.
inimi'cus
pop'ulus
se'nior






French.
ennemi
peuple
sire






English.
enemy
people
sir



8. Other Elements.—In addition to its primary
  constituents—namely, the Anglo-Saxon, Latin, and
  French-Latin—the English vocabulary contains a large number of
  Greek derivatives and a considerable number of Italian, Spanish, and
  Portuguese words, besides various terms derived from miscellaneous
  sources.
The following are examples of words taken from miscellaneous
  sources; that is, from sources other than Anglo-Saxon, Latin,
  French-Latin, and Greek:—
Hebrew: amen, cherub, jubilee, leviathan, manna,
  sabbath, seraph.
Arabic: admiral, alcohol, algebra, assassin, camphor,
  caravan, chemistry, cipher, coffee, elixir, gazelle, lemon, magazine,
  nabob, sultan.
Turkish: bey, chibouk, chouse, janissary, kiosk,
  tulip.
Persian: azure, bazaar, checkmate, chess, cimeter,
  demijohn, dervise, orange, paradise, pasha, turban.
Hindustani: calico, jungle, pariah, punch, rupee,
  shampoo, toddy.
Malay: a-muck, bamboo, bantam, gamboge, gong,
  gutta-percha, mango.
Chinese: nankeen, tea.
Polynesian: kangaroo, taboo, tattoo.
American Indian: maize, moccasin, pemmican, potato,
  tobacco, tomahawk, tomato, wigwam.
Celtic: bard, bran, brat, cradle, clan, druid, pony,
  whiskey.
Scandinavian: by-law, clown, dregs, fellow, glade,
  hustings, kidnap, plough.
Dutch, or Hollandish: block, boom, bowsprit, reef,
  skates, sloop, yacht.
Italian: canto, cupola, gondola, grotto, lava, opera,
  piano, regatta, soprano, stucco, vista.
Spanish: armada, cargo, cigar, desperado, flotilla,
  grandee, mosquito, mulatto, punctilio, sherry, sierra.
Portuguese: caste, commodore, fetish, mandarin,
  palaver.
9. Proportions.—On an examination of passages selected
  from modern English authors, it is found that of every hundred words
  sixty are of Anglo-Saxon origin, thirty of Latin, five of Greek, and all
  the other sources combined furnish the remaining five.
By actual count, there are more words of classical than of
  Anglo-Saxon origin in the English vocabulary,—probably two and a
  half times as many of the former as of the latter. But Anglo-Saxon words
  are so much more employed—owing to the constant repetition of
  conjunctions, prepositions, adverbs, auxiliaries, etc. (all of
  Anglo-Saxon origin)—that in any page of even the most Latinized
  writer they greatly preponderate. In the Bible, and in Shakespeare's
  vocabulary, they are in the proportion of ninety per cent. For specimens
  showing Anglo-Saxon words, see p. 136.

II.—ETYMOLOGICAL CLASSES OF WORDS.
10. Classes by Origin.—With respect to their origin,
  words are divided into two classes,—primitive words and derivative
  words.
11. A primitive word, or root, is one that cannot be
  reduced to a more simple form in the language to which it is native: as,
  man, good, run.
12. A derivative word is one made up of a root and one
  or more formative elements: as, manly, goodness,
  runner.
The formative elements are called prefixes and suffixes. (See §§ 16,
  17.)
13. By Composition.—With respect to their composition,
  words are divided into two classes,—simple and compound words.
14. A simple word consists of a single significant term:
  as, school, master, rain, bow.
15. A compound word is one made up of two or more simple
  words united: as, school-master, rainbow.
In some compound words the constituent parts are joined by
  the hyphen as school-master; in others the parts coalesce and the
  compound forms a single (though not a simple) word, as
  rainbow.

III.—PREFIXES AND SUFFIXES.
16. A prefix is a significant syllable or word placed before
  and joined with a word to modify its meaning: as, unsafe = not
  safe; remove = move back; circumnavigate = sail around.
17. A suffix is a significant syllable or syllables placed
  after and joined with a word to modify its meaning: as, safely =
  in a safe manner; movable = that may be moved;
  navigation = act of sailing.
The word affix signifies either a prefix or a suffix; and the
  verb to affix means to join a prefix or a suffix to a
  root-word.

IV.—RULES OF SPELLING USED IN FORMING DERIVATIVE
WORDS.
Rule 1.—Final "e" followed by a Vowel.
Final e of a primitive word is dropped on taking a suffix
  beginning with a vowel: as, blame + able = blamable; guide + ance =
  guidance; come + ing = coming; force + ible = forcible; obscure + ity =
  obscurity.
Exception 1.—Words ending in ge or
  ce usually retain the e before a suffix beginning with
  a or o, for the reason that c and g would
  have the hard sound if the e were dropped: as, peace + able =
  peaceable; change + able = changeable; courage + ous =
  courageous.
Exception 2.—Words ending in oe retain
  the e to preserve the sound of the root: as, shoe + ing = shoeing;
  hoe + ing = hoeing. The e is retained in a few words to prevent
  their being confounded with similar words: as, singe + ing = singeing (to
  prevent its being confounded with singing).
Rule II.—Final "e" followed by a Consonant.
Final e of a primitive word is retained on taking a suffix
  beginning with a consonant: as, pale + ness = paleness; large + ly =
  largely.
Exception 1.—When the final e is preceded
  by a vowel, it is sometimes omitted; as, due + ly = duly; true + ly =
  truly; whole + ly = wholly.
Exception 2.—A few words ending in e drop
  the e before a suffix beginning with a consonant: as, judge + ment
  = judgment; lodge + ment = lodgment; abridge + ment =
  abridgment.
Rule III.—Final "y" preceded by a Consonant.
Final y of a primitive word, when preceded by a consonant, is
  generally changed into i on the addition of a suffix.
Exception 1.—Before ing or ish,
  the final y is retained to prevent the doubling of the i:
  as, pity + ing = pitying.
Exception 2.—Words ending in ie and
  dropping the e, by Rule I. change the i into y to
  prevent the doubling of the i: as, die + ing = dying; lie + ing =
  lying.
Exception 3.—Final y is sometimes changed
  into e: as, duty + ous = duteous; beauty + ous =
  beauteous.
Rule IV.—Final "y" preceded by a Vowel.
Final y of a primitive word, when preceded by a vowel, should
  not be changed into an i before a suffix: as, joy + less =
  joyless.
Rule V.—Doubling.
Monosyllables and other words accented on the last syllable, when they
  end with a single consonant, preceded by a single vowel, or by a vowel
  after qu, double their final letter before a suffix beginning with
  a vowel: as, rob + ed = robbed; fop + ish = foppish; squat + er =
  squatter; prefer' + ing = prefer'ring.
Exceptions.—X final, being equivalent to
  ks, is never doubled; and when the derivative does not retain the
  accent of the root, the final consonant is not always doubled: as,
  prefer' + ence = pref'erence.
Rule VI.—No Doubling.
A final consonant, when it is not preceded by a single vowel, or when
  the accent is not on the last syllable, should remain single before an
  additional syllable: as, toil + ing = tolling; cheat + ed = cheated;
  murmur + ing = murmuring.

III.—DIRECTIONS IN THE STUDY OF LATIN DERIVATIVES.
1. A Latin primitive, or root, is a Latin word from
  which a certain number of English derivative words is formed.   Thus the
  Latin verb du'cere, to draw or lead, is a Latin primitive or root,
  and from it are formed educe, education, deduction,
  ductile, reproductive, and several hundred other English
  words.
2. Latin roots consist chiefly of verbs, nouns, and
  adjectives.
3. English derivatives from  Latin  words are generally formed
  not from the root itself but from a part of the root called the
  radical.    Thus, in the word "education," the root-word is
  ducere, but the radical is duc- (education = e +
  duc + ate + ion).
4. A radical is a word or a part of a word used in
  forming English derivatives.
5. Sometimes several radicals from the same root-word are used,
  the different radicals being taken from different grammatical forms of
  the root-word.
6. Verb-radicals are formed principally from two parts of the
  verb,—the first person singular of the present indicative, and a
  part called the supine, which is a verbal noun corresponding to
  the English infinitive in -ing.    Thus:—



1st pers. sing. pres. ind.
Root
Derivative
Supine
Root
Derivative






duco (I draw)
duc-
educe
ductum (drawing, or to draw)
duct-
ductile



I. In giving a Latin verb-primitive in this book three "principal
  parts" of the verb will be given, namely: (1) The present infinitive, (2)
  the first person singular of the present indicative, and (3) the
  supine—the second and the third parts because from them radicals
  are obtained, and the infinitive because this is the part used in naming
  a verb in a general way. Thus as we say that loved, loving,
  etc., are parts of the verb "to love," so we say that a'mo
  (present ind.) and ama'tum (supine) are parts of the verb
  ama're.
II. It should be noted that it is incorrect to translate amo,
  amatum, by "to love," since neither of these words is in the
  infinitive mood, which is amare. The indication of the Latin
  infinitive will be found of great utility, as it is the part by which a
  Latin verb is referred to in the Dictionary.
7. Noun-radicals and adjective radicals are formed from
  the nominative and from the genitive (or possessive) case of words
  belonging to these parts of speech. Thus:—



NOM. CASE.
iter (a journey)
 
GEN. CASE.
itineris (of a journey)
felicis (nom. felix, happy)






ROOT.
iter-.
 
ROOT
itiner-
felic-






DERIVATIVE.
reiterate
 
DERIVATIVE.
itinerant
felicity



NOTE.—These explanations of the mode of forming
  radicals are given by way of general information; but this book
  presupposes and requires no knowledge of Latin, since in every group of
  English derivatives from Latin, not only the root-words in their several
  parts, but the radicals actually used in word-formation, are
  given.
Pronunciation of Latin Words.
1. Every word in Latin must have as many syllables as it has vowels or
  diphthongs: as miles (= mi'les).
2. C is pronounced like k before a, o,
  u; and like s before e, i, y, and the
  diphthongs æ and œ: as cado, pronounced
  ka'do; cedo, pronounced se'do.
3. G is pronounced hard before a, o, u,
  and soft like j before e, i, y, æ,
  œ: as gusto, in which g is pronounced as in
  August; gero, pronounced je'ro.
4. A consonant between two vowels must be joined to the latter: as
  bene, pronounced be'ne.
5. Two consonants in the middle of a word must be divided: as
  mille, pronounced mil'le.
6. The diphthongs æ and œ are sounded like
  e: as cædo, pronounced ce'do.
7. Words of two syllables are accented on the first: as ager,
  pronounced a'jer.
8. When a word of more than one syllable ends in a, the
  a should be sounded like ah: as musa, pronounced
  mu'sah.
9. T, s, and c, before ia, ie,
  ii, io, iu, and eu, preceded immediately by
  the accent, in Latin words as in English, change into sh and
  zh: as fa'cio, pronounced fa'sheo; san'cio,
  pronounced san'sheo; spa'tium, pronounced
  spa'sheum.
NOTE.—According to the Roman method of pronouncing
  Latin, the vowels a, e, i, o, u are
  pronounced as in baa, bait, beet, boat,
  boot; ae, au, ei, oe as in
  aisle, our, eight, oil; c always like
  k; g as in get; j as y in yes;
  t as in until; v as w. See any Latin
  grammar.

LATIN ROOTS AND ENGLISH DERIVATIVES.
DIVISION I.—METHOD OF STUDY.

1. AG'ERE: a'go, ac'tum, to do, to drive.
Radicals: ag- and act-.
1.  act, v.   ANALYSIS:   from actum by dropping
  the termination um. DEFINITION: to do, to perform. The noun
  "act" is formed in the same way. DEFINITION: a thing done, a deed or
  performance.
2. ac'tion: act + ion = the act of doing: hence, a thing
  done.
3. act'ive: act + ive = having the quality of acting: hence,

5. a'gent: ag + ent = one who acts: hence, one who acts or
  transacts business for another.
6. ag'ile: ag + ile = apt to act: hence, nimble, brisk.

8. enact': en + act = to put in act: hence, to decree.
9. transact': trans + act = to drive through: hence, to
  perform.
EXERCISE.
(1.) What two parts of speech is "act"?—Write a sentence

Floral devices were tastefully introduced. The

  fraternity have been infringed. The metal was fused
  in iron pans. By the law of primogeniture the eldest son will
  succeed to the estate. Congress met, and a general
  of the army was chosen president. The gradient is gentle,
  and the access easy. The reform of the refractory
  was in the highest degree genuine. We received our
  frugal meal with gratitude. Many of the inhabitants
  perished in the flames. Hamilton and Jay were leading
  federalists. To err is human; to forgive, divine.

EXERCISE.
We reject insincere homage. When the body was
  exhumed the jury decided that poison had been administered.
  Legendary stories were related by the friar. The
  lessons were selected with intelligence. Levity and
  gravity are different qualities. The mayor's speech
  was more ludicrous than facetious. The magistrate
  claimed jurisdiction in the locality. We heard Hamlet's
  soliloquy finely delivered. Do you recollect the
  magnificent lines at the beginning of "Paradise Lost"? The
  lecturer was lucid in his allusions. In
  mediæval times homage was exacted of all vassals. The

Pronunciation of Greek Words.
Gamma has always the hard sound of g, as in
  give.
Kappa is represented by c in English words, although in
  Greek it has but one sound, that of our k.
Upsilon is represented by y in English words; in Greek
  it has always the sound of u in mute.

In Greek words, as in Latin, there are always as many syllables as
  there are vowels and diphthongs.

ANGLO-SAXON ROOTS AND ENGLISH DERIVATIVES.
The pronunciation of Anglo-Saxon is much nearer to that of modern
  German or the Continental pronunciation of Latin than of modern
  English.
The letters of the alphabet wanting in Anglo-Saxon are: j,
  k, q, v, and z. K is commonly
  represented by c; thus, cyning (king) is pronounced
  kining; cyrtel, kirtle; qu is represented by
  cw, as cwic, quick; cwen, queen;
  cwellan, to quell; th is represented by two peculiar
  characters, one of which in its reduced form resembles y, as in
  ye olden times, where ye should be pronounced the,
  and not ye, as is often ignorantly done.
Long vowels should be carefully distinguished from short vowels. Long
  vowels are a as far, ae as in fare, e
  as in they, i as in pique, o as in
  bone, u as in rule, y as in i
  (nearly). Short vowels are a as in fast, ae as in
  man, e as in men, i as in pin,
  o as in God, u as in full, y as in
  i (nearly).
In the diphthongs ea, eo, and ie, the first
  element receives the stress; the second is pronounced very lightly.
There are no silent letters in Anglo-Saxon as in modern English. The
  vowel of every syllable is pronounced, and in difficult combinations of
  consonants, as in hlud, loud, cniht, knight, cnif,
  knife, each consonant has its distinct sound.
E before a and o has the sound of y as a
  consonant; i before e and u has the same sound:
  thus, Earl = yarl; eow = you; iett =
  yett; and iúgoth = yúgoth, youth.

  thanes oft inrode—against which one nothing accounted. And this
  year were slain nine earls and one king; and this year made the
  West-Saxons peace with the army.

MILTON.


Of man's first disobedience, and the fruit
Of that forbidden tree, whose mortal taste
Brought death into the world, and all our woe,
With loss of Eden, till one greater man
Restore us and regain the blissful seat—
Sing, heavenly Muse.


With thee conversing, I forget all time,
All seasons, and their change; all please alike.
Sweet is the breath of morn, her rising sweet,
With charm of earliest birds; pleasant the sun
When first on this delightful land he spreads
His orient beams on herb, tree, fruit, and flower,
Glistering with dew; fragrant the fertile earth,
After soft showers; and sweet the coming on
Of grateful evening mild; then silent night
With this her solemn bird, and this fair moon,
And these the gems of heaven, her starry train.


SHAKESPEARE.


To be, or not to be, that is the question;
Whether 't is nobler in the mind to suffer
The stings and arrows of outrageous fortune,
Or to take arms against a sea of troubles,
And, by opposing, end them? To die, to sleep;
No more;—and by a sleep to say we end
The heartache and the thousand natural shocks
That flesh is heir to! 't were a consummation
Devoutly to be wished. To die; to sleep;
To sleep?—perchance to dream!




All the world's a stage,
And all the men and women merely players.
They have their exits and their entrances,
And one man in his time plays many parts;
His acts being seven ages. At first the infant,
Mewling and puking in his nurse's arms.
And then the whining school-boy, with his satchel
And shining morning face, creeping like snail
Unwillingly to school. And then the lover,
Sighing like furnace, with a woeful ballad
Made to his mistress' eyebrow. Then a soldier,
Full of strange oaths, and bearded like the pard,
Jealous in honour, sudden and quick in quarrel;
Seeking the bubble reputation
Even in the cannon's mouth.


TRANSLATION OF THE BIBLE.
In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth. And the
  earth was without form, and void; and darkness was upon the
  face of the deep: and the Spirit of God moved upon
  the face of the waters. And God said, Let there be light; and
  there was light. And God saw the light, that it was good; and God
  divided the light from the darkness. And God called the light Day,
  and the darkness he called Night. And the evening and the morning were
  the first day.—Genesis i. 1-6.
And it came to pass, that when Isaac was old, and his
  eyes were dim, so that he could not see, he called Esau, his
  eldest son, and said unto him, My son. And he said unto him, Behold, here
  am I. And he said, Behold now, I am old, I know not the day of my death.
  Now therefore take, I pray thee, thy weapons, thy quiver
  and thy bow, and go out to the field, and take me some venison;
  and make me savoury meat, such as I love, and bring it to me, that
  I may eat; that my soul may bless thee before I die. And Rebekah
  heard when Isaac spake to Esau his son. And Esau
  went to the field to hunt for venison, and to bring it. And
  Rebekah spake unto Jacob her son, saying, Behold, I heard
  thy father speak unto Esau thy brother, saying, Bring me
  venison, and make me savoury meat, that I may eat, and
  bless thee before the Lord before my death.—Genesis xxvii.
  1-7.
THOMSON.


These as they change, Almighty Father! these
Are but the varied God. The rolling year
Is full of thee. Forth in the pleasing spring
Thy beauty walks, thy tenderness and love.
Wide flush the fields; the softening air is balm;
Echo the mountains round; the forest smiles;
And every sense and every heart is joy.
Then comes thy glory in the summer months,
With light and heat refulgent. Then thy sun
Shoots full perfection through the swelling year.


ADDISON.
I was yesterday, about sunset, walking in the open fields, till the
  night insensibly fell upon me. I at first amused myself
  with all the richness and variety of colours which
  appeared in the western parts of heaven. In
  proportion as they faded away and went out, several
  stars and planets appeared, one after another, till the whole
  firmament was in a glow. The blueness of the ether was
  exceedingly heightened and enlivened by the season of the
  year.
YOUNG.


Let Indians, and the gay, like Indians, fond
Of feathered fopperies, the sun adore:
Darkness has more divinity for me;
It strikes thought inward; it drives back the soul
To settle on herself, our point supreme.
There lies our theater: there sits our judge.
Darkness the curtain drops o'er life's dull scene:
'T is the kind hand of Providence stretched out
'Twixt man and vanity; 't is reason's reign,
And virtue's too; these tutelary shades
Are man's asylum from the tainted throng.
Night is the good man's friend, and guardian too.
It no less rescues virtue, than inspires.


SWIFT.
Wisdom is a fox, who, after long hunting, will at last cost you
  the pains to dig out. 'T is a cheese, which by how much the richer
  has the thicker, homelier, and the coarser coat; and whereof, to a
  judicious palate, the maggots are the best. 'Tis a sack
  posset, wherein the deeper you go on you will find it sweeter. But
  then, lastly, 'tis a nut, which, unless you choose with judgment,
  may cost you a tooth, and pay you with nothing but a
  worm.
HUME.
The beauties of her person and graces of her
  air combined to make her the most amiable of women; and the
  charms of her address and conversation aided the
  impression which her lovely figure made on the heart of all
  beholders. Ambitious and active in her temper, yet
  inclined to cheerfulness and society; of a lofty
  spirit, constant and even vehement in her
  purpose, yet politic, gentle, and affable, in her
  demeanor, she seemed to partake only so much of the
  male virtues as to render her estimable, without
  relinquishing those soft graces which compose the
  proper ornament of her sex.
GIBBON.
In the second century of the Christian era, the
  empire of Rome comprehended the fairest part of the
  earth, and the most civilized portion of mankind. The
  frontiers of that extensive monarchy were guarded by
  ancient renown, and disciplined valour. The gentle
  but powerful influence of laws and manners had gradually
  cemented the union of the provinces. Their peaceful
  inhabitants enjoyed and abused the advantages of wealth
  and luxury. The image of a free constitution was
  preserved with decent reverence.
JOHNSON.
Of genius, that power which constitutes a
  poet; that quality without which judgment is cold,
  and knowledge is inert; that energy which collects,
  combines, amplifies, and animates; the
  superiority must, with some hesitation, be allowed
  to Dryden. It is not to be inferred that of this poetical vigor
  Pope had only a little, because Dryden had more; for every
  other writer since Milton must give place to Pope; and even
  of Dryden it must be said, that if he has brighter paragraphs, he
  has not better poems.
BYRON.


Ancient of days! august Athena! where,
Where are thy men of might—thy grand in soul?
Gone—glimmering through the dream of things that were.
First in the race that led to Glory's goal,
They won, and passed away. Is this the whole?
A school-boy's tale—the wonder of an hour!
The warrior's-weapon and the sophist's stole
Are sought in vain, and o'er each mouldering tower,
Dim with the mist of years, gray flits the shade of power.


SIR WALTER SCOTT.


The way was long, the wind was cold,
The Minstrel was infirm and old;
His withered cheek and tresses gray
Seemed to have known a better day;
The harp, his sole remaining joy,
Was carried by an orphan boy.
The last of all the bards was he
Who sung of border chivalry;
For, well-a-day! their dale was fled;
His tuneful brethren all were dead;
And he, neglected and oppressed,
Wished to be with them and at rest.


WORDSWORTH.


Ah! little doth the young one dream,
When full of play and childish cares,
What power is in his wildest scream,
Heard by his mother unawares!
He knows it not, he cannot guess;
Years to a mother bring distress;
But do not make her love the less.


My son, if thou be humbled, poor,
Hopeless of honor and of gain,
Oh! do not dread thy mother's door;
Think not of me with grief and pain.
I now can see with better eyes;
And worldly grandeur I despise,
And Fortune with her gifts and lies.


TENNYSON.


Not wholly in the busy world, nor quite
Beyond it, blooms the garden that I love.
News from the humming city comes to it
In sound of funeral or of marriage bells;
And sitting muffled in dark leaves you hear
The windy clanging of the winter clock;
Although between it and the garden lies
A league of grass, washed by a slow broad stream,
That, stirred with languid pulses of the oar,
Waves all its lazy lilies, and creeps on,
Barge laden, to three arches of a bridge,
Crowned with the minster-towers.

Notes.
1 To teachers who are
  unacquainted with the original Word-Analysis, the following
  extract from the Preface to that work may not be out of place:—
"The treatment of the Latin derivatives in Part II. presents a new and
  important feature, to wit: the systematic analysis of the structure and
  organism of derivative words, together with the statement of their
  primary meaning in such form that the pupil inevitably perceives its
  relation with the root, and in fact makes its primary meaning by
  the very process of analyzing the word into its primitive and its
  modifying prefix or suffix. It presents, also, a marked improvement in
  the method of approaching the definition,—a method by which the
  definition is seen to grow out of the primary meaning, and by
  which the analytic faculty of the pupil is exercised in tracing the
  transition from the primary meaning to the secondary and figurative
  meanings,—thus converting what is ordinarily a matter of rote into
  an agreeable exercise of the thinking faculty. Another point of novelty
  in the method of treatment is presented in the copious practical
  exercises on the use of words. The experienced instructor very
  well knows that pupils may memorize endless lists of terms and
  definitions without having any realization of the actual living power of
  words. Such a realization can only be gained by using the
  word,—by turning it over in a variety of ways, and by throwing upon
  it the side-lights of its synonym and contrasted word. The method of thus
  utilizing English derivatives gives a study which possesses at once
  simplicity and fruitfulness,—the two desiderata of an
  instrument of elementary discipline."
2 "Etymology," Greek
  et'umon, the true literal sense of a word according to its
  derivation, and log'os, a discourse.
3 "Vocabulary," Latin
  vocabula'rium, a stock of words; from vox, vocis, a voice, a
  word.
4 By the Low German
  languages are meant those spoken in the low, flat countries of North
  Germany, along the coast of the North Sea (as Dutch, the language of
  Holland); and they are so called in contradistinction to High
  German, or German proper.
5 For the full definition,
  reference should be had to a dictionary; but in the present exercise the
  literal or etymological signification may suffice.
6 Fen'do,
  fen'dere, is used in Latin only in composition.
7 Another mode of spelling
  defense.
8 From pass and
  over, a feast of the Jews instituted to commemorate the
  providential escape of the Jews to Egypt, when God, smiting the
  first-born of the Egyptians passed over the houses of the
  Israelites, which were marked with the blood of the paschal lamb.
9 For the explanation of the
  etymology see Webster's Unabridged.
10 For is different
  from fore, and corresponds to the German ver, different
  from vor.
A, be, for, ge, are often indifferently
  prefixed to verbs, especially to perfect tenses and perfect participles,
  as well as to verbal nouns.—BOSWORTH.
11 Ster was the
  Anglo-Saxon feminine termination. Females once conducted the work of
  brewing, baking, etc., hence brewster, baxter; these words were
  afterwards applied to men when they undertook the same work. Ster
  is now used in depreciating, as in trickster, youngster.

such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
