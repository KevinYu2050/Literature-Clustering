INTRODUCTORY REMARKS



The Art of Biography
Is different from Geography.
Geography is about Maps,
But Biography is about Chaps.



[8]




[9]
SIR CHRISTOPHER WREN



Sir Christopher Wren
Said, "I am going to dine with some men.
"If anybody calls
"Say I am designing St. Paul's."



[10]




[11]
MIGUEL DE CERVANTES



The people of Spain think Cervantes
Equal to half-a-dozen Dantes:
An opinion resented most bitterly
By the people of Italy.



[12]




[13]
GEORGE BERNARD SHAW



Mr Bernard Shaw
Was just setting out for the war,
When he heard it was a dangerous trade
And demonstrably underpaid.



[14]




[15]
SIR HUMPHREY DAVY



Sir Humphrey Davy
Abominated gravy.
He lived in the odium
Of having discovered Sodium.



[16]




[17]
J. S. MILL



John Stuart Mill,
By a mighty effort of will,
Overcame his natural bonhomie
And wrote "Principles of Political Economy."



[18]




[19]
FRANÇOIS LISZT



The Abbé Liszt
Hit the piano with his fist.
That was the way
He used to play.



[20]




[21]
LORD CLIVE



What I like about Clive
Is that he is no longer alive.
There is a great deal to be said
For being dead.



[22]




[23]
KING EDWARD THE CONFESSOR



Edward the Confessor
Slept under the dresser.
When that began to pall,
He slept in the hall.



[24]




[25]
THE REV. JOHN CLIFFORD
M.A., LL.B., D.D.



Dr Clifford
And I have differed.
He disapproves of gin:
I disapprove of sin.



[26]




[27]
MESSRS CHAPMAN & HALL



Chapman & Hall
Swore not at all.
Mr Chapman's yea was yea,
And Mr Hall's nay was nay.



[28]




[29]
KARL MARX



Karl Marx
Was completely wrapped up in his sharks.
The poor creatures seriously missed him
While he was attacking the capitalist system.



[30]




[31]
OTTO THE GREAT



The great Emperor Otto
Could not decide upon a motto.
His mind wavered between
"L'Etat C'est Moi" and "Ich Dien."



[32]




[33]
MARCONI



Guglielmo Marconi
Was brought up on macaroni,
But when he gets it now
There's no end of a row.



[34]




[35]
DAVID HUME



That you have all heard of Hume
I tacitly assume;
But you didn't know, perhaps,
That his parents were Lapps.



[36]




[37]
MR H. BELLOC



Mr Hilaire Belloc
Is a case for legislation ad hoc.
He seems to think nobody minds
His books being all of different kinds.



[38]




[39]
JOB



It is understood that Job
Never read "The Globe;"
But nothing could be higher than
His opinion of Leviathan.



[40]




[41]
PIZARRO



The views of Pizarro
Were perhaps a little narrow.
He killed the Caciques
Because (he said) they were sneaks.



[42]




[43]
THE DUKE OF FIFE
K.T., P.C., G.C.V.O.



It looked bad when the Duke of Fife
Left off using a knife;
But people began to talk
When he left off using a fork.



[44]




[45]
THE DUKE OF WELLINGTON



The great Duke of Wellington
Reduced himself to a skellington.
He reached seven stone two,
And then——Waterloo!



[46]




[47]
JOHN BUNYAN



I do not extenuate Bunyan's
Intemperate use of onions,
But if I knew a wicked ogress
I would lend her "The Pilgrim's Progress."



[48]




[49]
GEORGE HIRST



When I faced the bowling of Hirst
I ejaculated, "Do your worst!"
He said, "Right you are, Sid."
----And he did.



[50]




[51]
ERASMUS AND THE HUMANISTS



After dinner, Erasmus
Told Colet not to be "blas'mous"
Which Colet, with some heat,
Requested him to repeat.



[52]




[53]
BESANT AND RICE



Sir (then Mr) Walter Besant
Would never touch pheasant,
But Mr James Rice
Thought it so nice.



[54]




[55]
TIZIANO VECELLI



When the great Titian
Was in a critical condition,
He was carefully nursed
By Francis the First.



[56]




[57]
PROFESSOR JAMES DEWAR, F.R.S.



Professor Dewar
Is a better man than you are.
None of you asses
Can condense gases.



[58]




[59]
SIR WALTER RALEIGH



Sir Walter Raleigh
Bickered down the valley.
But he could do better than the rill,
For he could bicker up-hill.



[60]




[61]
JANE AUSTEN



The novels of Jane Austen
Are the ones to get lost in.


I wonder if Labby
Has read "Northanger Abbey?"



[62]




[63]
ODO OF BAYEUX



Archbishop Odo
Was just in the middle of "Dodo,"
When he remembered that it was Sunday.
"Sic transit gloria mundi."



[64]




[65]
DAVID RICARDO



The intrepid Ricardo
With characteristic bravado,
Alluded openly to Rent
Wherever he went.



[66]




[67]
SIR THOMAS À MALLORY



Sir Thomas à Mallory
Always went to the gallery.
He said, not without nous,
That it was the best place in the house.



[68]




[69]
MR ALFRED BEIT



Mr Alfred Beit
Screamed suddenly in the night.
When they asked him why
He made no reply.



[70]




[71]
CIMABUE



When they told Cimabue
He didn't know how to cooee,
He replied, "Perhaps I mayn't,
But I do know how to paint."



[72]




[73]
PRESIDENT ROOSEVELT



If only Mr Roosevelt
Knew how officers in the Blues felt,
He wouldn't be so rife
With his Strenuous Life.



[74]




[75]
ROBERT HARLEY, EARL OF OXFORD



People wondered why Harley
Sang "Wae's me for Prince Charlie."
"It is childish," they said, "to mourn
For a person not yet born."



[76]




[77]
SIR ALEXANDER FULLER ACLAND-HOOD, M.P.



Sir Alexander Acland-Hood
Believed in Free Food:
But he was Eleusinian
About this opinion.



[78]




[79]
MAHOMET



I am not Mahomet.
----Far from it.
That is the mistake
All of you seem to make.



[80]




[81]
EDVARD GRIEG



The musician Grieg
Joined the Primrose League.
It gave him the idea of his chorus,
"The Unburied Ichthyosaurus."



[82]




[83]
JAN VAN EYCK



The younger Van Eyck
Was christened Jan, and not Mike.
The thought of this curious mistake
Often kept him awake.



[84]




[85]
MR T. WERNER LAURIE



Mr Werner Laurie
Is not at all sorry
He undertook the publication
Of this instructive compilation.



[86]




[87][88]

posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be

the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
