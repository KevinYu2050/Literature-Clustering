INTRODUCTION.

The Metamorphoses of Ovid are a
compendium of the Mythological narratives of ancient Greece and Rome, so
ingeniously framed, as to embrace a large amount of information upon
almost every subject connected with the learning, traditions, manners,
and customs of antiquity, and have afforded a fertile field of
investigation to the learned of the civilized world. To present to the
public a faithful translation of a work, universally esteemed, not only
for its varied information, but as being the masterpiece of one of the
greatest Poets of ancient Rome, is the object of the present volume.
To render the work, which, from its nature and design, must, of
necessity, be replete with matter of obscure meaning, more inviting to
the scholar, and more intelligible to those who are unversed in
Classical literature, the translation is accompanied with Notes and
Explanations, which, it is believed, will be found to throw considerable
light upon the origin and meaning of some of the traditions of heathen
Mythology.
In the translation, the text of the Delphin edition has been
generally adopted; and no deviation has been made from it, except in a
few instances, where the reason for such a step is stated in the notes;
at the same time, the texts of Burmann and Gierig have throughout been
carefully consulted. The several editions vary materially in respect to
punctuation; the Translator has consequently used his own discretion in
adopting that which seemed to him the most fully to convey in each
passage the intended meaning of the writer.
The Metamorphoses of Ovid have been frequently translated into the
English language. On referring to Mr. Bohn’s excellent Catalogue of the
Greek and Latin Classics and their Translations, we find that the whole
of the work has been twice translated into English Prose, while five
translations in Verse are there enumerated. A prose version of the
Metamorphoses was published by Joseph Davidson, about the
iv
middle of the last century, which professes to be “as near the original
as the different idioms of the Latin and English will allow;” and to be
“printed for the use of schools, as well as of private gentlemen.”
A few moments’ perusal of this work will satisfy the reader that it
has not the slightest pretension to be considered a literal translation,
while, by its departure from the strict letter of the author, it has
gained nothing in elegance of diction. It is accompanied by “critical,
historical, geographical, and classical notes in English, from the best
Commentators, both ancient and modern, beside a great number of notes,
entirely new;” but notwithstanding this announcement, these annotations
will be found to be but few in number, and, with some exceptions in the
early part of the volume, to throw very little light on the obscurities
of the text. A fifth edition of this translation was published so
recently as 1822, but without any improvement, beyond the furbishing up
of the old-fashioned language of the original preface. A far more
literal translation of the Metamorphoses is that by John Clarke, which
was first published about the year 1735, and had attained to a seventh
edition in 1779. Although this version may be pronounced very nearly to
fulfil the promise set forth in its title page, of being “as literal as
possible,” still, from the singular inelegance of its style, and the
fact of its being couched in the conversational language of the early
part of the last century, and being unaccompanied by any attempt at
explanation, it may safely be pronounced to be ill adapted to the
requirements of the present age. Indeed, it would not, perhaps, be too
much to assert, that, although the translator may, in his own words,
“have done an acceptable service to such gentlemen as are desirous of
regaining or improving the skill they acquired at school,” he has, in
many instances, burlesqued rather than translated his author. Some of
the curiosities of his version will be found set forth in the notes;
but, for the purpose of the more readily justifying this assertion, a
few of them are adduced: the word “nitidus” is always rendered “neat,”
whether applied to a fish, a cow, a chariot, a laurel, the steps of a
temple, or the art of wrestling. He renders “horridus,” “in a rude
pickle;” “virgo” is generally translated “the young lady;” “vir” is “a
gentleman;” “senex” and “senior” are indifferently “the old blade,” “the
old fellow,”
v
or “the old gentleman;” while “summa arx” is “the very tip-top.”
“Misera” is “poor soul;” “exsilio” means “to bounce forth;” “pellex” is
“a miss;” “lumina” are “the peepers;” “turbatum fugere” is “to scower
off in a mighty bustle;” “confundor” is “to be jumbled;” and “squalidus”
is “in a sorry pickle.” “Importuna” is “a plaguy baggage;” “adulterium”
is rendered “her pranks;” “ambages” becomes either “a long rabble of
words,” “a long-winded detail,” or “a tale of a tub;” “miserabile
carmen” is “a dismal ditty;” “increpare hos” is “to rattle these
blades;” “penetralia” means “the parlour;” while “accingere,” more
literally than elegantly, is translated “buckle to.” “Situs” is “nasty
stuff;” “oscula jungere” is “to tip him a kiss;” “pingue ingenium” is a
circumlocution for “a blockhead;” “anilia instrumenta” are “his old
woman’s accoutrements;” and “repetito munere Bacchi” is conveyed to the
sense of the reader as, “they return again to their bottle, and take the
other glass.” These are but a specimen of the blemishes which disfigure
the most literal of the English translations of the Metamorphoses.
In the year 1656, a little volume was published, by J[ohn]
B[ulloker,] entitled “Ovid’s Metamorphosis, translated grammatically,
and, according to the propriety of our English tongue, so far as grammar
and the verse will bear, written chiefly for the use of schools, to be
used according to the directions in the preface to the painfull
schoolmaster, and more fully in the book called, ‘Ludus Literarius, or
the Grammar school, chap. 8.’” Notwithstanding a title so pretentious,
it contains a translation of no more than the first 567 lines of the
first Book, executed in a fanciful and pedantic manner; and its rarity
is now the only merit of the volume. A literal interlinear
translation of the first Book “on the plan recommended by Mr. Locke,”
was published in 1839, which had been already preceded by “a selection
from the Metamorphoses of Ovid, adapted to the Hamiltonian system, by a
literal and interlineal translation,” published by James Hamilton, the
author of the Hamiltonian system. This work contains selections only
from the first six books, and consequently embraces but a very small
portion of the entire work.
For the better elucidation of the different fabulous narratives and
allusions, explanations have been added, which
vi
are principally derived from the writings of Herodotus, Apollodorus,
Pausanias, Dio Cassius, Dionysius of Halicarnassus, Strabo, Hyginus,
Nonnus, and others of the historians, philosophers, and mythologists of
antiquity. A great number of these illustrations are collected in
the elaborate edition of Ovid, published by the Abbé Banier, one of the
most learned scholars of the last century; who has, therein, and in his
“Explanations of the Fables of Antiquity,” with indefatigable labour and
research, culled from the works of ancient authors, all such information
as he considered likely to throw any light upon the Mythology and
history of Greece and Rome.
This course has been adopted, because it was considered that a
statement of the opinions of contemporary authors would be the most
likely to enable the reader to form his own ideas upon the various
subjects presented to his notice. Indeed, except in two or three
instances, space has been found too limited to allow of more than an
occasional reference to the opinions of modern scholars. Such being the
object of the explanations, the reader will not be surprised at the
absence of critical and lengthened discussions on many of those moot
points of Mythology and early history which have occupied, with no very
positive result, the attention of Niebuhr, Lobeck, Müller, Buttmann, and
many other scholars of profound learning.

A SYNOPTICAL VIEW
OF THE
PRINCIPAL TRANSFORMATIONS MENTIONED IN
THE METAMORPHOSES.


BOOK I.
Chaos is divided by the Deity into
four Elements: to these their respective inhabitants are assigned, and
man is created from earth and water. The four Ages follow, and in the
last of these the Giants aspire to the sovereignty of the heavens; being
slain by Jupiter, a new race of men springs up from their blood. These
becoming noted for their impiety, Jupiter not only transforms Lycaon
into a wolf, but destroys the whole race of men and animals by a Deluge,
with the exception of Deucalion and Pyrrha, who, when the waters have
abated, renew the human race, by throwing stones behind them. Other
animated beings are produced by heat and moisture: and, among them, the
serpent Python. Phœbus slays him, and institutes the Pythian games as a
memorial of the event, in which the conquerors are crowned with beech;
for as yet the laurel does not exist, into which Daphne is changed soon
after, while flying from Phœbus. On this taking place, the other rivers
repair to her father Peneus, either to congratulate or to console him;
but Inachus is not there, as he is grieving for his daughter Io, whom
Jupiter, having first ravished her, has changed into a cow. She is
entrusted by Juno to the care of Argus; Mercury having first related to
him the transformation of the Nymph Syrinx into reeds, slays him, on
which his eyes are placed by Juno in the tail of the peacock. Io, having
recovered human shape, becomes the mother of Epaphus.

BOOK II.
Epaphus, having accused Phaëton of
falsely asserting that Phœbus is his father, Phaëton requests Phœbus, as
a proof of his affection towards his child, to allow him the guidance of
the
viii
chariot of the Sun for one day. This being granted, the whole earth is
set on fire by him, and the Æthiopians are turned black by the heat.
Jupiter strikes Phaëton with a thunderbolt, and while his sisters and
his kinsman Cyenus are lamenting him, the former are changed into trees,
and Cyenus into a swan. On visiting the earth, that he may repair the
damage caused by the conflagration, Jupiter sees Calisto, and, assuming
the form of Diana, he debauches her. Juno, being enraged, changes
Calisto into a bear; and her own son Arcas being about to pierce her
with an arrow, Jupiter places them both among the Constellations. Juno
having complained of this to Oceanus, is borne back to the heavens by
her peacocks, who have so lately changed their colour; a thing which has
also happened to the raven, which has been lately changed from white to
black, he having refused to listen to the warnings of the crow (who
relates the story of its own transformation, and of that of Nyctimene
into an owl), and having persisted in informing Phœbus of the intrigues
of Coronis. Her son Æsculapius being cut out of the womb of Coronis and
carried to the cave of Chiron the Centaur, Ocyrrhoë, the daughter of
Chiron, is changed into a mare, while she is prophesying. Her father in
vain invokes the assistance of Apollo, for he, in the guise of a
shepherd, is tending his oxen in the country of Elis. He neglecting his
herd, Mercury takes the opportunity of stealing it; after which he
changes Battus into a touchstone, for betraying him. Flying thence,
Mercury beholds Herse, the daughter of Cecrops, and debauches her. Her
sister Aglauros, being envious of her, is changed into a rock. Mercury
returns to heaven, on which Jupiter orders him to drive the herds of
Agenor towards the shore; and then, assuming the form of a bull, he
carries Europa over the sea to the isle of Crete.

BOOK III.
Agenor commands his son Cadmus to
seek his sister Europa. While he is doing this, he slays a dragon in
Bœotia; and having sowed its teeth in the earth, men are produced, with
whose assistance he builds the walls of Thebes. His first cause of grief
is the fate of his grandson Actæon, who, being changed into a stag, is
torn to pieces by his own hounds. This, however, gives pleasure to Juno,
who hates not only Semele, the daughter of Cadmus, and the favourite of
Jupiter, but all the house of Agenor as well. Assuming the form of
Beroë, she contrives the destruction of Semele by the lightnings of
Jupiter; while Bacchus, being saved alive from his mother’s womb, is
brought up on the earth. Jupiter has a discussion with Juno on the
relative pleasures of the sexes, and they agree to
ix
refer the question to Tiresias, who has been of both sexes. He gives his
decision in favour of Jupiter, on which Juno deprives him of sight; and,
by way of recompense, Jupiter bestows on him the gift of prophesy. His
first prediction is fulfilled in the case of Narcissus, who, despising
the advances of all females (in whose number is Echo, who has been
transformed into a sound), at last pines away with love for himself, and
is changed into a flower which bears his name. Pentheus, however,
derides the prophet; who predicts his fate, and his predictions are soon
verified; for, on the celebration of the orgies, Bacchus having assumed
a disguise, is brought before him; and having related to Pentheus the
story of the transformation of the Etrurian sailors into dolphins, he is
thrown into prison. On this, Pentheus is torn in pieces by the
Bacchanals, and great respect is afterwards paid to the rites of
Bacchus.

BOOK IV.
Still Alcithoë and her sisters,
neglecting the rites, attend to their spinning, during the festivities,
and pass the time in telling stories; and, among others, that of Pyramus
and Thisbe, by whose blood the mulberry is turned from white to black,
and that of the discovery of the intrigues of Mars and Venus, on the
information of the Sun. They also tell how the Sun assumed the form of
Eurynome, that he might enjoy her daughter Leucothoë; how Clytie, becoming
jealous of her sister, was transformed into a sun-flower; and how
Salmacis and Hermaphroditus had become united into one body. After this,
through the agency of Bacchus, the sisters are transformed into bats,
and their webs are changed into vines. Ino rejoicing at this, Juno, in
her hatred and indignation, sends one of the Furies to her, who causes
her to be struck with insanity, on which she leaps into the sea, with
her son Melicerta in her arms; but by the intercession of Venus, they
become sea Deities, and their Sidonian attendants, who are bewailing
them as dead, are changed into rocks. Cadmus, afflicted at this fresh
calamity, retires from Thebes, and flies to Illyria, together with his
wife, where they are both transformed into serpents. Of those who
despise Bacchus, Acrisius alone remains, the grandfather of Perseus,
who, having cut off the head of the Gorgon Medusa, serpents are produced
by her blood. Perseus turns Atlas into a mountain, and having liberated
Andromeda, he changes sea-weed into coral, and afterwards marries
her.

BOOK V.
A tumult arising during the
celebration of the nuptials, Phineus claims Andromeda, who has been
betrothed to him; and
x
together with Prœtus, he and Polydectes are turned into stone. Pallas,
who has aided Perseus, now leaves him, and goes to Helicon, to see the
fountain of Hippocrene. The Muses tell her the story of Pyreneus and the
Pierides, who were transformed into magpies after they had repeated
various songs on the subjects of the transformation of the Deities into
various forms of animals; the rape of Proserpine, the wanderings of
Ceres, the change of Cyane into a fountain, of a boy into a lizard, of
Ascalaphus into an owl, of the Sirens into birds in part, of Arethusa
into a spring, of Lyncus into a lynx, and of the invention of
agriculture by Triptolemus.

BOOK VI.
Influenced by the example of the
Muses, Pallas determines on the destruction of Arachne. She enters with
her into a contest for the superiority in the art of weaving. Each
represents various transformations on her web, and then Arachne is
changed into a spider. Niobe, however, is not deterred thereby from
preferring her own lot to that of Latona; on account of which, all her
children are slain by Apollo and Diana, and she is changed into a rock.
On learning this, while one person relates the transformation by Latona
of the Lycian rustics into frogs, another calls to mind how Marsyas was
flayed by Apollo. Niobe is lamented by Pelops, whose shoulder is of
ivory. To console the Thebans in their afflictions, ambassadors come
from the adjacent cities. The Athenians alone are absent, as they are
attacked by hordes of barbarians, who are routed by Tereus, who marries
Progne, the daughter of Pandion. Tereus coming a second time to Athens,
takes back with him to his kingdom Philomela, his wife’s sister; and
having committed violence on her, with other enormities, he is
transformed into a hoopoe, while Philomela is changed into a
nightingale, and Progne becomes a swallow. Pandion, hearing of these
wondrous events dies of grief. Erectheus succeeds him, whose daughter,
Orithyia, is ravished by Boreas, and by him is the mother of Calais and
Zethes, who are of the number of the Argonauts on the following
occasion.

BOOK VII.
Jason, by the aid of Medea, having
conquered the bulls that breathe forth flames, having sowed the teeth of
a serpent, from which armed men are produced, and having lulled the
dragon to sleep, recovers the Golden Fleece. Medea, accompanying Jason
to Greece, restores Æson to youth by the aid of drugs; and promising the
same to Pelias, having first, as a specimen, changed a ram into a lamb,
by stratagem she kills him. Passing through many places made remarkable
by various transformations, and
xi
having slain her children, she marries Ægeus, when Theseus returns home,
and narrowly escapes being poisoned by her magic potions. Minos
interrupts the joy of Ægeus on the return of his son, and wages war
against him; having collected troops from all parts, even from Paros,
where Arne has been changed into a jackdaw. Minos endeavours to gain the
alliance of Æacus, who, however, refuses it, and sends the Myrmidons,
(who have been changed into ants from men after a severe pestilence),
under the command of Cephalus to assist Ægeus. Cephalus relates to
Phocus, the son of Æacus, how, being carried off by Aurora and assuming
another shape, he had induced his wife Procris to prove faithless; and
how he had received from her a dog and a javelin, the former of which,
together with a fox, was changed into stone; while the latter, by
inadvertence, caused the death of his wife.



Introduction by Stephen Brooks, Jr., from 1899 McKay edition:

v

INTRODUCTION.
P. Ovidius Naso—commonly known
as Ovid—was born at Sulmo, about, ninety miles from Rome, in the year
43 B.C. His father belonged to an old equestrian family, and at an
early age brought his son to Rome, where he was educated under the most
distinguished masters. Very little is known of the poetís life, except
that which is gathered from his own writings. After finishing his
education at home he visited Athens, in company with the poet Macer, for
the purpose of completing his studies, and before returning visited the
magnificent cities of Asia Minor and spent nearly a year in Sicily.
Although as a young man Ovid showed a natural taste and inclination
for poetical composition, he was by no means encouraged to indulge in
this pursuit. His father thought that the profession of law was much
more apt to lead to distinction and political eminence than the vocation
of a poet. He therefore dissuaded his son from writing poetry and urged
him to devote himself to the legal profession. Compliance with his
father’s wishes led him to spend much time in the forum, and for a while
poetry was abandoned. Upon attaining his majority,
vi
he held several minor offices of state; but neither his health nor his
inclinations would permit him to perform the duties of public life.
Poetry was his love, and in spite of the strong objections of his
father, he resolved to abandon the law courts and devote himself to a
more congenial occupation. He sought the society of the most
distinguished poets of the day, and his admiration for them amounted
almost to reverence. He numbered among his intimate friends the poets
Macer, Propertius, Ponticus and Bassus, while Æmilius Macer, Virgil’s
contemporary, used to read his compositions to him, and even the
fastidious Horace, it is said, occasionally delighted the young man’s
ear with the charm of his verse.
Ovid was married three times. His first wife he married when little
more than a boy, and the union does not seem to have been a happy one,
though it was probably due to no fault of the wife. His second wife
seems also to have been of blameless character, but his love for her was
of short duration. His third wife was a lady of the great Fabian house
and a friend of the Empress Livia. She appears to have been a woman in
every way worthy of the great and lasting love which the poet lavished
upon her to the day of his death.
Up to the age of fifty Ovid had lived a life of prosperity and
happiness. Though not a wealthy man, his means were such as to permit
him to indulge in the luxuries of refined life, and his attainments as
vii
a poet had surrounded him with a circle of most desirable friends and
admirers. He had even obtained the favor and patronage of the royal
family. About the year 8 A.D. he, however, incurred the great
displeasure of Augustus, and was ordered by him to withdraw from Rome
and dwell in the colony of Tomi, on the shore of the Euxine sea. Leaving
behind him a wife to whom he was devotedly attached he obeyed the edict
of his emperor and entered upon an exile from which he was destined
never to return. He died in banishment at Tomi in the year 18 A.D.
The exact reason for Ovid’s banishment has never been clear, though
there have been many conjectures as to the cause. About two years
previous to his exile Ovid had published a composition which had greatly
displeased Augustus, on account of its immoral tendency. Almost
coincident with this publication was the discovery of the scandal
relating to Julia, daughter of the emperor. It is probable that the
proximity of these two events tended to intensify the imperial
displeasure, and when some time later there was made public the intrigue
of the emperor’s granddaughter, the indignation of Augustus gave itself
vent in the banishment of Ovid.
The writings of Ovid consist of the Amores in three books; the
Heroic Epistles, twenty-one in number; the Ars Amatoria;
the Remedia Amoris; the Metamorphoses, in fifteen books;
the Fasti, in
viii
six books; the Tristia, in five books; the Epistles, in
four books, and a few minor poems. In the following pages will be found
a translation of the Metamorphoses.

S. Austin Allibone, the distinguished author, writes:

“There is a growing disapprobation, both in Great Britain and America,
of the disproportionate length of time devoted by the youthful student
to the acquisition of the dead languages; and therefore nothing will
tend so effectually to the preservation of the Greek and Latin grammars
as their judicious union (the fruit of an intelligent compromise) with
the Interlinear Classics.”
DAVID McKAY, Publisher, Philadelphia,
Formerly published by Charles De Silver & Sons.



More about the texts
Ovid’s Metamorphoses, translated by Henry Thomas Riley
(1816-1878, B.A. 1840, M.A. 1859), was originally published in 1851 as
part of Bohn’s Classical Library. This e-text, covering Books I-VII, is
based on two reprints:

George Bell (London, 1893, one volume). This edition describes itself as
“reprinted from the stereotype plates”. These may have been the original
1851 plates; the Classical Library was sold to Bell & Daldy,
later George Bell.

David McKay (Philadelphia, 1899, two volumes), with introduction by
Edward Brooks. The introductory material from the Bell/Bohn edition is
absent. This edition was freshly typeset, correcting a few errors in the
Bell/Bohn edition but also introducing a number of new errors.
The McKay edition was the “base” of the e-text. The scanned,
proofread text was computer-checked against the text of the Bell
edition, and differences were in turn checked against page images of the
printed books. Where appropriate, the text was checked against one or
more versions of the Latin original. Most differences are trivial. McKay
uses American spelling such as “honor” for “honour”, and compound forms
such as “northwest” for “north-west”; punctuation is often changed,
though some apparent variations may be due to the quality of printing
and reproduction.
Note that the title page of the Bell edition lists the translator as
“Henry T. Riley, B.A.”, while the McKay edition has “M.A.” The sequence
of dates—original publication 1851, Riley M.A. 1859, reprint
1893—supports the idea that the Bell edition is a strict
facsimile.

Errors and Variations
Changes to the text are shown with mouse-hover popups, marked
in three ways:

—Errors shared by both editions.
—Errors introduced in the McKay edition. This is the largest group; in
particular, the typesetter appears not to have known Greek, and had
trouble distinguishing between œ and æ. Unless otherwise
noted, the Bell version was treated as the correct form.
—Errors
in the Bell/Bohn edition corrected in McKay, and variant readings where
the McKay text was used. Variant readings are “wrong” in the sense that
they are different from what is found in the Bell/Bohn text, but they
are acceptable translations of the Latin.

Italics in the translation—shown with braces { } in
the correction popups—are considered non-trivial because they
indicate text added by the translator, not present in the Latin
original. More complex errors and ambiguities are addressed in
supplementary footnotes marked by letters: A, B.
Numbered footnotes are from the original text.
Dieresis is unpredictable in both editions; forms such as
“Phaeton”, “Ocyrrhöe” and “Danäe” are common, and have been silently
corrected. Since the ligatures “æ” and “œ” are used consistently,
dieresis can be assumed even when not explicitly indicated.
The translator used a number of less common name forms and variant
spellings:

Cæus, Calisto, Lilybœus, Phyale, Phryxus, Progne:
The original, Greek-derived forms are Cœus (Κοιος), Callisto (Καλλιστω),
Lilybæus (Λιλυβαιος), Phiale (Φιαλη), Phrixus (Φριξος), Procne (Προκνη).
Note that in the main text, the name “Callisto” is never used, probably
on metrical grounds.

Damasicthon, Erectheus and similar:
Spellings in “-cth-” are used consistently in place of “-chth-” (Greek
-χθ-).

The pairs Achæa/Achaia, Ethiopia/Æthiopia, Phocea/Phocæa,
Proserpine/Proserpina all occur, with the McKay text following Bell in
all cases.

Footnote Numbering
In the original text, footnote numbers began from 1 in each Book, and
started over when the count passed 99. Almost all Books had duplications
in the sequence, usually in the form “17*”. There were no changes
between the two editions. In this e-text, footnotes have been renumbered
consecutively within each Book, without duplication; Books I and VII
continue past 100.

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.org/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the

Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included

from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without

Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any

distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a

request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
