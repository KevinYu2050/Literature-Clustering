injudicious, therefore, to make an attack with her unless
in combination with some other of your forces.
concerning the rook.—the rook is a most important
officer, yet few players even amongst the best avail themselves
sufficiently of his power. he has seldom much
scope for action in the early part of the engagement, but
when the field is thinned no time should be lost in bringing
him into action. you should then endeavor to double
your rooks, that is, to place them one before the other on
the same file: in this situation, mutually sustaining one
another, their potency on a clear field is equal to the
queen's.
it is usually good play to get command of an open file,
[]that is to say, a file which is occupied by no other man,
by stationing a rook at one end of it. when you have
thus gained possession of the file, should your opponent
try to dispossess you of it, by playing one of his rooks
on the same file, it is frequently better to defend with
your other rook than to take his or remove your own.
you will often embarrass your adversary, too, if you can
manage to post a rook on his second rank, say at your
king's th or queen's th square. in this position he
generally makes an attack on the pawns unmoved, and
compels the enemy to lose time in defending them, while
you can bring more forces into action.
one of the strongest reasons for playing out your pieces
early in the battle, is, that while at home they are not
only themselves inactive, but they utterly retard the
movements of your rooks. in an unskilfully developed
game it is a common occurrence to see the victory won
before the defeated player's rooks have ever moved.
concerning the bishop.—when the game is opened by
each party with king's pawn to king's th square, the
king's bishop is somewhat superior to the queen's,
because it can be sooner brought into play, and may be
made to bear immediately on the king's weak point, his
bishop's pawn. it is desirable therefore generally to
exchange your queen's bishop or queen's knight for the
adversary's king's bishop. the king's bishop should
rarely or never be played to the queen's d square before
the queen's pawn is moved. his best position, as we
have remarked above, is to queen's bishop's th square,
where he attacks the opponent's king's bishop's pawn.
if your antagonist then challenges an exchange of bishops
by moving his queen's bishop to king's d square, it is
not always prudent to accept it, because although you
may double the pawns on his king's file, you at the same
time afford him an open range for his king's rook when
he has castled. the best play in such a case is, therefore,
to retreat your king's bishop to queen's knight's d square.
be careful, as a general rule, in an open game, not to
[]move your queen's pawn one square before you bring out
the king's bishop, as by so doing you leave him but the
king's d square on which to move, and there his position
is defensive rather than attacking.
if strong in pawns towards the conclusion of the game,
endeavor to get rid of the enemy's bishops, because they
can impede the march of your pawns more readily than
either the rooks or knights.
when the other men are exchanged off, and you remain
with a bishop and two or three pawns, it is often proper to
keep your pawns on squares of a different color from those
on which your bishop travels, as he can then prevent the
opposing king from approaching them. if, however, you
have the worst of the game, it is mostly better then to
keep them on the same color as the bishop, that he may
defend them.
supposing you have pawns only at the end of a game,
and the adversary has a bishop, it is generally advisable
to move the pawns as soon as possible to squares of a different
color from the diagonals on which he moves.
do not indiscriminately exchange your bishops for
knights, or vice versâ. two bishops at the finish of a
game are stronger than two knights, and one knight
generally more useful than a single bishop.
concerning the knight.—the knight is at once the
most striking and most beautiful of all the pieces. the
singularity of its evolutions, by which it is enabled to
overleap the other men and wind its way into the penetralia
of the adverse ranks, and if attacked leap back
again within the boundary of its own, has rendered it the
favorite piece of leading players in every country.
the assault of the knight is more subtle and dangerous
than that of any other piece, because he attacks
without putting himself en prise, and his attack can never
be resisted by the interposition of another man.
at the commencement of a game, the best place for
the king's knight is at k. b's d sq.; it there attacks
your adversary's k's pawn, if it has been moved two
squares, and offers no impediment to the playing out your
[]king's bishop, and prevents the adversary from placing
his queen on your king rook's th sq., where she would
often be a source of restraint and danger to your king.
many persons prefer playing the k. kt. to k's d at the
second move, from the mistaken notion that the k. b's p.
should be moved before the knight is played to b's d;
this is an error, and generally leads to a very bad
game.
when you have brought out your q. kt. to b's d, it
is frequently advisable, at a proper opportunity, to get him
round by k's d sq. to the k. kt's d, where he exercises
a very important influence, by threatening, whenever the
square is left unguarded, to post himself on k. b's th.
a knight with three or four pawns, at the end of a
game, has an advantage over a bishop with an equal
number of pawns, because he can leap from white to
black, and thus attack the pawns on either colored
squares, whereas the bishop can attack them only when
they move on squares of the color of his diagonals. in
similar circumstances, however, he is not so useful in
defending as a bishop or a rook, since if forced to remove
he ceases to defend, while the rook or bishop may retreat
and still protect.
concerning the pawns.—struck by the scope and
power of the higher pieces, young players commonly
overlook the homely pawns, or deem them scarcely worthy
of regard, and are amazed to learn that the combinations
of these simple elements are among the most refined and
arduous studies of the science. yet such is the fact, and
without a thorough comprehension of their quiet but remarkable
predominance in almost every circumstance of
the game, it is impossible for any one to attain a high
degree of excellence.
it is generally advantageous for your pawns to occupy
the middle of the board, because when there they greatly
retard the movements of the opposing forces. the king's
pawn and queen's pawn, at their fourth squares, are well
posted, but it is not easy to maintain them in that position,
and if you are driven to advance one of them, the power
[]of both is much diminished. it is well, therefore, not to
be too eager to establish two pawns abreast in the centre
until you are fully able to sustain them there.
when you have two pawns abreast, the king and
queen's, for instance, at their fourth squares, should the
adversary attack one of them with a pawn, it is occasionally
better to advance the pawn that is attacked another
step, than to take the pawn.
the pawns, however, should seldom be far advanced,
unless they can be properly sustained by the pieces.
pawns at their fourth squares are therefore mostly more
powerful than at their sixth.
the king's bishop's pawn having no support but that
of the king, is usually the point to which the first attack
is directed, and more than ordinary care should be taken
to preserve it. it is rarely good play to move the king's
bishop's pawn to bishop's d early in the game.
as a general rule, it is not advisable to move king's
knight's pawn or queen's knight's pawn early in the
game. the former played to k. kt's d square will
often allow your adversary to play his queen's bishop to
your king's rook's d square, a dangerous move when
you have castled on king's side.
after castling, it is generally proper not to move the
knight's pawn that is before your king, until you are
obliged.
in a diagonal line of pawns you should endeavor to
preserve the pawn at the head of them. pawns, when
united, have great strength; but when separated, their
power is sensibly lessened.
a passed pawn is mostly serviceable when supported
by another pawn.
a doubled pawn is not in all cases a disadvantage,
especially if it is united with other pawns. the worst
kind of doubled pawn is one on a rook's file; while the
most advantageous is the king's bishop's pawn doubled
on the king's file, because it strengthens your middle
pawns and opens a file for your king's rook.
the pawn being less important than a piece, it is usually
[]better to defend with it than with a piece. for the
same reason it is likewise better to protect a pawn with
a pawn than with a piece. no piece can interpose
between the attack of a pawn, it can therefore frequently
check the king with great advantage.
be cautious generally of advancing the pawns far on
either side, till you see on which your opponent castles;
and remember, when approaching the end of a game,
where you have pawns, or even a pawn, against a minor
piece, that you may win, but that your opponent, except
in very rare cases, cannot, and that two pawns in any
situation can protect themselves against the adverse king.
there is nothing that will improve you so much as
playing with good players; never refuse, therefore, when
any one offers you odds, to accept them: you cannot
expect a proficient to feel much interest in playing with
you upon even terms, and as you are sure to derive both
amusement and instruction from him, it is but fair that
he should name the conditions. it will soon happen that
you yourself will be able to give odds to many amateurs
whom you meet; when this is the case, avoid, if possible,
playing them even, or you are likely to acquire an indolent,
neglectful habit of play, which it will be very difficult
to throw off.
never permit your hand to hover over the board, or
indeed to approach it, until you have completely made up
your mind what piece to move; a contrary habit begets
a feeling of indecision that is fatal to success. play invariably
according to the laws of the game, neither taking
back a move yourself, nor allowing your opponent to recall
one. do not exhibit impatience when your adversary
is long in making his move. his slowness is a tacit compliment
to your skill, and enables you to play with proportionate
quickness, because while he is meditating on
his next step you can take advantage of the time to consider
what shall be your rejoinder; besides, it is absolutely
[]necessary for every one desirous of excelling at
chess to play slowly. a fine player examines occasionally
from five to twenty or more moves on each side: can this
be done in a moment? it is easy enough to play quick
against inferior play; but against equal and very good
play one cannot play quick without losing.
learn to play indifferently either with the white or
black men. do not play too many games at a sitting—and
never suffer the loss of a game to occasion you much
disquietude. think of how many thousand games a
philidor must have lost before he attained his highest
excellence; besides, the loss of one well-fought game
with a fine practitioner will do more towards your improvement
than the gain of ten light skirmishes with
weaker players than yourself. endeavor to play all your
pieces equally well. many young players have a predilection
for a particular piece, as the knight or the queen,
and lose both time and position in trying to prevent exchanges
of their favorite. in opening your game, endeavor
to bring your superior officers into action speedily,
but avoid all premature attacks. take care not to play
a piece to a square where it impedes the action of another,
and beware of venturing an unsupported piece in
the adversary's game.
if subjected to a violent attack, you may often disconcert
your opponent by compelling the exchange of two
or three pieces. when, however, you are about to exchange
officers, you must calculate not only their ordinary
value, but their peculiar worth in the situation in question;
for example, a rook is generally more valuable
than a knight or a bishop; but it will happen, that by
exchanging a rook for one of the latter you may greatly
improve your game.
it is mostly good play to exchange the pieces off when
you are superior in power, so that when you have the
odds of a piece given to you by a finished player, you
should endeavor to exchange as often as you can consistently
with safety.
when an exchange of two or more pieces appears inevitable,
[]look closely to see whether it is better for you
to take first or to compel your opponent to do so. when
one of the enemy is completely in your power, do not be
too eager to make the capture—there may perhaps be a
move of importance which you can make before you take
him. beware also of snatching hastily a proffered man,
it may be only given as a bait to catch a more important
advantage from you.
if at the end of a game you remain with pawns against
a knight and find it difficult to evade his repeated checks,
recollect that by placing your king on the same diagonal
as the knight, with but one intervening square between
them, you cannot again be checked under three moves.
when you have lost a game which has cost you great
attention, it is a good practice to play it over afterwards
in private, and endeavor to discover where the error
occurred through which your opponent gained his first
advantage. this custom will improve both your memory
and your play.
before proceeding to the consideration of the various
methods of commencing the game, it is advisable for you to
recur to the preceding sections, which treat of the arrangement
of the men—the moves of the men—their relative
powers—the technical terms in use among players—and the
laws of the game. when you have familiarized yourself
with these, it will be time for you to direct your attention to
that most important feature in the game of chess—the
art of opening the game.
there are several modes of beginning the game, but
the following are the principal:—
st. each player begins by moving his king's pawn
to king's th square, and the first player then moves
king's knight to king's bishop's d square. this is
called the king's knight's opening.
d. each player commences by moving his king's
pawn to king's th square, and then he who has the
[]first move plays king's bishop to queen's bishop's th
square. this is known as the king's bishop's opening.
d. each player opens with king's pawn to king's
th square, and the first plays queen's bishop's pawn to
bishop's d square. this is termed the queen's bishop's
pawn's opening.
th. each player begins with king's pawn to king's
th square, and the first follows with king's bishop's
pawn to bishop's th square. this is called the king's
gambit.
of these four openings on the king's side there are
many modifications, of which each has its appropriate
appellation; there are also several openings begun on the
queen's side, but the four above-named are those most
generally practised, and with them you should be
thoroughly conversant before advancing further.
preparatory to the investigation of the several
openings treated of in the following chapters, it may not
be uninstructive to give a short game which shall exhibit
the application of some technical phrases in use at chess,
and at the same time show a few of the most prominent
errors into which an inexperienced player is likely to
fall.
in this game, as in all the analyses which follow, the
reader will be supposed to play the white pieces and to
have the first move, although, as it has been before
remarked, it is advisable for you to accustom yourself to
play with either black or white, for which purpose it is
well to practise the attack, first with the white and then
with the black pieces.
. k's p. to k's th.. k's p. to k's th.
when the men are first arranged in battle order, it is
seen that the only pieces which have the power of moving
are the knights, and that to liberate the others it is indispensably
necessary to move a pawn. now, as the
[]king's pawn, on being moved, gives freedom both to the
queen and to the king's bishop, it is more frequently
played at the beginning of the game than any other. you
will remember, in speaking of the pawns it was shown
that on certain conditions they have the privilege of going
either one or two steps when they are first moved.
. k's b. to q's b's th.. k's b. to q's b's th.
thus far the game illustrative of the king's bishop's
opening is correctly begun. each party plays his king's
bishop thus, because it attacks the most vulnerable point
of the adverse position, viz., the king's bishop's pawn.
. q. b's pawn to b's d.. q's knight to b's d.
in playing this pawn your object is afterwards to play
queen's pawn to queen's th square, and thus establish
your pawns in the centre; but black foresees the intention,
and thinks to prevent its execution by bringing
another piece to bear upon the square.
. q's pawn to q's th.. pawn takes q's pawn.
. q's b's pawn takes pawn.. k's b. takes pawn.
here you have played without due consideration. black's
third move of queen's knight to bishop's d square was
a bad one, and afforded you an opportunity of gaining a
striking advantage, but omitting this, you have enabled
him to gain a valuable pawn for nothing. observe, now,
your reply to his third move was good enough, (. queen's
pawn to queen's th square), but when he took your
pawn with his, instead of taking again, you ought to
have taken his king's bishop's pawn with your bishop,
giving check: the game would then most probably have
gone on thus:—
. k's b. takes k. b. pawn (ch.). k. takes bishop.
. queen to k. r's th (check).. k. to his b's square.
. queen takes k's bishop (check).
in this variation, you see black has lost his king's
bishop's pawn, and what is worse, has lost his privilege
of castling, by being forced to move his king; and
although for a moment he had gained a bishop for a
pawn, it was quite clear that he must lose a bishop in
return by the check of the adverse queen at king's
[]rook's th square. it is true that he need not have
taken the bishop, but still his king must have moved,
and white could then have taken the king's knight with
his bishop, having always the better position.
but now to proceed with the actual game:—
. k's knight to k's b's d.. queen to k's b's d.
bringing out the knight is good play; you not only
threaten to win his bishop, but you afford yourself an opportunity
of castling whenever it may be needful. black
would have played better in retiring the bishop from the
attack to queen's knight d square than in supporting it
with the queen.
. knight takes bishop.. queen takes knight.
both parties played well in their last moves. you rightly
took off the bishop, because supported by the queen he
menaced your queen's kt's pawn, and black properly
retook with his queen instead of the knight, because
having a pawn ahead, it was his interest to exchange
off the queens.
. q's knight to q's d.. k's knight to b's d.
you played correctly here in not exchanging queens, and
also in protecting your bishop and your king's pawn,
both of which were attacked by the adverse queen; but
all this might have been done without impeding the movements
of any of your pieces, by simply playing queen to
king's d sq.; as it is, the knight entirely shuts your
queen's bishop from the field. black properly brings
another piece to the attack of your king's pawn:—
. k. b's pawn to b's d.. q's knight to king's th.
in protecting the king's pawn with your k. bishop's
pawn, you are guilty of a very common error among
young players; as you improve, you will find that it is
rarely good play to move the k. bishop's pawn to the
third square—in the present instance, for example, you
have deprived yourself of the power of castling, at least
for some time, since the adverse queen now commands
the very square upon which your king, in castling on his
own side, has to move. black's last move is much more
[]sensible. he again attacks your bishop, and by the same
move brings his q's knight into co-operation with the
king's, on the weak point of your position:—
. pawn to q. kt's d.. q. takes queen's rook.
this is a serious blunder indeed. in your anxiety to save
the threatened bishop, which you feared to withdraw to
q. kt's d sq., on account of the adverse knight's
giving check at your queen's d square, you have actually
left your q's rook en prise! black takes it, of course,
and having gained such an important advantage, ought to
win easily.
. castles, (i.e., plays k to his kt's sq., and rook to k. b's sq.). q's kt. takes bishop.
. kt. takes kt.. castles.
. queen to her d.. q. b's pawn to b's th.
your last move is very subtle; finding the mistake that
black had committed in not retreating his queen directly
after winning the rook, you determine, if possible, to
prevent her escape by gaining command of all the squares
she can move to. seeing the danger, black throws forward
this pawn to enable him, if possible, to bring the
queen off, by playing her to her th sq., giving check.
. bishop to q. kt's d.. q. takes q. r's pawn.
this move of the bishop is well timed; it does not, to
be sure, prevent the queen from escaping for a move or
two, but it gives you an attack, and very great command
of the field.
. q. to k. kt's th.. knight to k's sq.
very well played on both sides. by playing the queen
to k. kt's th, you threatened to win his knight by at
once taking it with your bishop, which he could not
retake without opening check on his king. instead of
so moving, you might have played the knight to q. rook's
th sq., in which case, by afterwards moving the rook to
q. rook's square, it would have been impossible for his
queen to get away.
. q. to king's d.. k. r's pawn to r's d.
you prudently retreated your queen to guard her knight's
[]pawn, which it was important to save, on account of its
protection to the knight. black played the king's r's
pawn to prevent your queen returning to the same post
of attack.
. k. r's p. to r's d.. k. to his r's sq.
here are two instances of what is called "lost time" at
chess, neither move serving in the slightest degree to advance
the game of the player. that you should have
overlooked the opportunity of gaining the adverse queen
was to be expected. similar advantages present themselves
in every game between young players, and are
unobserved.
. k. b's pawn to b's th.. q. kt's pawn to kt's d.
again you have failed to see a most important move; you
might have taken the k. rook's pawn with your queen,
giving check safely, because black could not take your
queen without being in check with your bishop. all
this time, too, your opponent omits to see the jeopardy
his queen is in, and that as far as practical assistance to
his other pieces is concerned, she might as well be off the
board.
. k. kt's pawn to kt's th.. q. kt's pawn to q. kt's th.
your last move is far from good. by thus attacking your
knight, black threatens to win a piece, because upon
playing away the knight you must leave the bishop unprotected.
. pawn to k. kt's th.. pawn takes knight.
although your knight was thus attacked, it might have
been saved very easily. in the first place, by your taking
the adversary's q. b's pawn, threatening to take his k's
rook, on his removing which, or interposing the q's pawn,
you could have taken the pawn which attacked your
knight; or, in the second place, by moving your queen
to her d square. in the latter case, if black ventured
to take the knight, you would have won his queen by
taking the k. kt's pawn with your bishop, giving check,
and thus exposing his queen to yours. black would have
been obliged to parry the check, either by taking the
[]bishop or removing his king, and you would then have
taken his queen. this position is very instructive, and
merits attentive examination.
. b. to q. b's d.. pawn takes q. kt's pawn.
. pawn to k. r's th.. pawn to q. kt's th.
in such a position, the advance of your king's flank
pawns is a process too dilatory to be very effective.
. pawn to k. b's th.. pawn to q. kt's th, becoming a queen.
now the fault of your tortoise-like movements with the
pawns becomes fatally evident. black has been enabled
to make a second queen, and has an overwhelming force
at command.
. rook takes queen.. queen takes rook (check).
you had no better move than to take the newly-elected
queen, for two queens must have proved irresistible.
. king to his kt's d.. kt. to queen's d.
. k. kt's pawn to kt's th.. p. takes pawn.
. p. takes pawn.. bishop to q. kt's d.
here you have given another remarkable instance of lost
opportunity. at your last move you might have redeemed
all former disasters by checkmating your opponent in two
moves. endeavor to find out how this was to be accomplished.
. k. r's pawn to r's th.. knight takes king's pawn.
. bishop to king's th.. kt. to k. kt's th (discovering check).
up to black's last move you had still the opportunity of
winning the game before mentioned.
. king to kt's d.. k's rook to b's th. (ch.)
. king to r's th.. q. to k. bishop's th.
at this point you were utterly at the mercy of your
antagonist, but fortunately he wanted the skill to avail
himself properly of his vast superiority in force and position,
or he might have won the game in half a dozen
different ways.
. q. takes rook.. q. takes queen.
. b. takes k. kt's pawn (ch.). king takes bishop.
this was your last chance, and its success should serve
[]to convince you that in the most apparently hopeless
situations of the game there is often a latent resource, if
we will only have the patience to search it out. by taking
the bishop, black has left your king, who is not in check,
no move without going into check, and as you have
neither piece nor pawn besides to play, you are stalemated,
and the game is drawn.
if thoroughly acquainted with the information contained
in the preceding sections, you may now proceed to the
consideration of the openings; before you do this, however,
it is necessary to apprise you that without a great
abridgment of the notation adopted in the foregoing game,
it would be impossible to compress within the limits of
this work one-third of the variations which are required
to be given. the following abbreviations will therefore
be used throughout the remainder of our handbook:—
k.forking.
q.queen.
r.rook.
b.bishop.
kt.knight.
p.pawn.
sq.square.
adv.adversary's.
ch.check or checking.
dis. ch.discovering check.
the word "square" is only used to distinguish the first
row of squares on which the superior pieces stand at the
commencement—thus, we say, kt. to k's d, and omit
the word square; but if the kt. were played to k's first
square or r's first square, the move would be described
not as kt. to k's or r's first square, but "kt. to k's or
r's square."
. p. to k's th.. p. to k's th.
. k's kt. to b's d.
your second move gives the name to this opening, which
is one of the most popular and instructive of all the
various methods of commencing the game. the kt., it
will be observed, at once attacks the adverse pawn, and
the defence recommended by the best authors and the
leading players of europe, is for black to reply . q's
kt. to b's d. he has, however, many other ways of
playing, and as the examination of these comparatively
simple variations will serve to prepare you for the more
complex and elaborate combinations of the best defences,
it will be advisable to consider them previously. in the
first place, then, black may sustain his pawn by playing—
. p. to k. b's d.
. k's b. to q's d.
. q. to k. b's d.
. p. to q's d.
or, in the second place, he may leave it unprotected, and
play—
. k's kt. to b's d.
. k's b. to q. b's th.
. p. to k. b's th.
. p. to q's th.
he has thus eight different modes of play at his command,
besides the move of q's kt. to b's d, in answer
to your second move of k's kt. to b's d. each of
these will form the subject of a separate game.
the damiano gambit.
. p. to k's th.. p. to k's th.
. k's kt. to b's d.. p. to k. b's d.
. kt. takes k's p.. p. takes kt.

. q's kt. to q's d.. q. takes r. (ch.)
. k. to his d.. q. takes k's r.
and you give mate in two moves.
the foregoing moves are dependent on black's taking
the kt., which is very bad play. his proper move, under
the circumstances, is . q. to k's d, as in the following
example:—
. p. to k's th.. p. to k's th.
. k's kt. to b's d.. p. to k. b's d.

in reply, you may now play p. to k. r's th, having a

. q. kt. to q's th, you move . q. to her d, then

in lieu of that move, he play . b. to q. r's th,
you can move . b. to q's d, and presently castle on
the q's side; and lastly, if he play . k. to r's sq.,
then you take your queen to k. r's th, and he cannot
save the game.

it is seldom good to bring the q. into play early in the
game, unless for some decisive blow, because she is so
easily assailable by the opponent's minor pieces, and in
attacking her he brings his forces into action.
. k. b. to q. b's th.. q. to k. kt's d.
black now attacks two undefended pawns, but he can
take neither without ruinous loss to him; for suppose on
your playing p. to q's d, to protect the k. p., he ventures
to take the k. kt. p., you immediately take the
k. b. p. with your bishop (ch.). if he then take the
bishop with his king, you attack his queen with your
rook, and on her retiring to r. th, you win her by k. kt.
to his th (ch.). on the other hand, you can leave
the king's pawn, and castle safely.

and white has the better game.
the result of the preceding analysis serves to prove
that q. p. one, as the second move of black, is not a
tenable defence; since, play as he can afterwards, if the
best moves are adopted by the first player, he will always
have a very insecure or a very constrained game.

[a] notes by jas. mason.—in this familiar "double lopez" predicament,
. b. takes kt. is highly recommended, if a dull but durable
kind of game is desired.
[b] ... something like a leap in the dark. if the doubled pawn can
be "dissolved" betimes, or the open file well used in attack, a safe
landing may be confidently expected.
[c] more or less necessary, sooner or later. black does not attempt to
dissolve, just here; for then q. to r's th, threatening kt. to kt's th,
might be uncomfortable.
[d] routine—indirectly including the questionable . p. to q's th ?
at once kt. to kt's sq., to be speedily followed by p. to kt's d and p.
to k. b's th, would have given the matter another and perhaps very
different complexion.
[e] ... the difference is in favor of the young american representative,
who presses it fully.
[f] manifestly weakening. the russian champion feels himself on
the defensive, and at a loss how to continue. thus the text move
may be as good as any other.
[g] . kt. to r's th would be much stronger, the importance of halting
the advancing rook pawn duly considered. going from bad to
worse, the downright blunder two moves later caps the climax—and
more need not be said.

an attentive examination of the eight separate methods
of reply to your second move of k's kt. to b's d in the
antecedent games, will have enabled you to understand
that four at least of these defences, viz.: p. to k. b's
d, b. to q's d, q. to b's d, and b. to q. b's th, are
untenable and injurious for the game of the second
player, and that the remaining four, if not absolutely bad
for him, are unsatisfactory, because against the best attack,
they leave the balance of advantage in favor of the party
playing first.
it is now time to consider the consequences to both
parties when black, abandoning the objectionable or uncertain
modes of play he has hitherto adopted, shall
answer with the move which the best authorities at length
concur in recommending as the proper one, i.e. . q's
kt. to b's d. upon his playing thus, you have the
choice of three good moves: in the first place to play .
k's b. to q. b's th, as in the present game; secondly,
. p. to q's th; and thirdly, p. to q. b's d. the two
latter of which will form the subjects of games hereafter.

. k. kt. to b's d.. q. kt. to b's d.
. k. b. to q. b's th.. k. b. to q. b's th
it is generally admitted that black's third move is the
best he can adopt; and the opening now formed is that
which the italians have entitled the "giuoco piano;" an
opening, less attacking than many others, but one perfectly
safe for both players, and therefore always in
request, and which usually generates games of the most
solid and instructive kind.

taking your b. with k. r's p., he might move q. b. to

there is little difference in the positions, but your men
are better disposed for immediate action, and you have the
advantage of a knight against a bishop.

and black surrenders.
[a] black would have gained no advantage by taking the q. p. at
this juncture, or by advancing his p. to k. kt's th, to attack the
rook. the move in the text was not made without due deliberation,
and we believe it the best on the board.
[b] white designedly gives up the queen's pawn, to get a counter
attack with his combined forces.
[c] queen to her knight's d would have been worse than useless.
[d] had he gone to queen's square, to protect his threatened pawn,
white would have won the king's knight's pawn. (e.g.)
. q to q's sq.
. r. takes k. kt. p. (ch.). k. takes r.
. q. to k. b's th. (ch.). k. to r's sq.
. k. r. to k. b's th.. r. to k. r's th.
. q. takes k. r.. q. takes r.
. q. takes r. (ch.), &c.
[e] a most important move. black dare not now advance his q. p.
on account of q. to b's th (ch.), which would enable white to double
his rooks on the adversary's k. kt. p., and thus win easily.
[f] k. to r's d would have been very bad play, because black
would have checked with his q. at k's th; and if then the queen
were interposed, he would have taken the q. and played r. to k's
th (ch.), and afterwards r. to q. kt's th.
[g] he could not save all the pawns attacked.
[h] threatening to take the k. kt. p. with his rook, and then
check with the queen at her bishop's d.
[i] k. to his d would have been better.
[j] this was ill-judged. he should have played r. to k. kt's d,
or q. r's square.

and then black mates in two moves.
[a] from this point we look upon the game as virtually lost for
white.
[b] probably his best move. had he played p. to q. kt's th, black
might have taken it with his kt., and upon the b. p. retaking, have
moved k. b. to q's th, winning the exchange.
[c] as good a move, perhaps, as he had on the board. by playing
k. r. to q's sq., he would evidently have lost a piece.
[d] well conceived. tempting black to open the discovered check,
which would cost him "the exchange."
[e] interposing the kt. and then pushing the k. b. p. on the rook
afterwards, would have been unwise, on account of b. to q's d.
(ch.), &c.
[f] threatening, if white took the q. p., to win a piece.

black resigns.
[a] the proper move is b. to q. kt's d. taking the pawn gives
an immediate advantage to white.
[b] if white play p. to k. b's th at this point, his opponent may
move kt. to k. kt's th, threatening to play afterwards q. to k.
kt's th (ch.), and then mate with his kt. at b's th.
[c] from this move the attack is very lively and interesting.
[d] there appears to be nothing better, bad as this is.

is in the field, appears safer play.
[b] threatening to exchange the kt., and then take q. b. p. with
the rook.
[c] intending again to take the kt., and thus win a pawn.
[d] well played, the advance of this pawn secures to him an irresistible
attack.

[a] white in this instance had probably made up his mind to adopt the
plan frequently employed by gunsberg in the giuoco piano, namely,
playing q. to q's d and castling rapidly on the queen's side.—gunsberg.
[b] ... black's difficulty is how to dispose of the kt. now kt's d
in this instance, although perhaps preferable, is not a good place either,
subject as it must be to an early attack from the k. r. p.—hoffer.
[c] if . b. takes kt., kt. to b's th; and the kt. cannot be captured
on account of b. to kt's th winning the queen.—leeds mercury.
[d] ... there seems little use in this move. either he can castle
now; if not, then it is proof positive that his defence is bad.—gunsberg.
[e] this premature advance is admirably taken advantage of by
steinitz.—leeds mercury.
[f] ... although this looks like a defensive move, (to make room for
the kt.) it is a subtle design which was entirely overlooked by lasker.—hoffer.
[g] but here is a great mistake, which ought to lose the game.
. p. takes q. b. would have averted the loss of a pawn, but at the
expense of position and attack; he was outplayed by steinitz up to
this point.
[h] from this move to the end lasker exhibits most marvellous
power of resource. with . q. r. to b's sq. he commenced one of the
most ingenious attacks.
[i] one of the moves which will make this game memorable. the
object is, if p. takes p. to open up the rook's file by p. to r's th.
allowance must of course be made for the fact that, being two pawns
behind, white has nothing to lose and everything to gain by desperate
tactics.—gunsberg.
[j] exhibiting consummate coolness in a "do or die" predicament.—pollock.
[k] . b. to b's th is evidence with what perfect lucidity lasker detects
the weak spots, and how immediately he takes advantage of his
opponent's slightest omission or commission.—hoffer.
[l] ... imprudent. the king should make for safety in the corner,
via b's d.—mason.
[m] threatening r. to b's th.—gunsberg.
[n] ... . q. to q's d is a final blunder. . r to q's d should
have been played, or r. to k's d. the game is now over. it will be
readily admitted that it is a well-earned victory which none will
grudge the plucky young player.—hoffer.
... we really cannot see a satisfactory move, for if r. to k's d,
then follows q. to b's d (ch.), and r. to b's th. or if q. to q's sq.
then likewise q. to b's d (ch.) should gain some advantage, as, on
king playing to kt's th, white could continue with p. to r's th (ch.)
and q. to q. b's th, &c.—gunsberg.

i believe the best answering moves have been made by
black, and now, upon surveying the aspect of the board,
there can be no question, i apprehend, that your game is
much superior. the kt. which has captured your rook,
he can never extricate, while, to secure yours in the same
position, he must lose many moves, and thus afford you
ample time for the development of your remaining forces.

white announced mate in eight moves.
[a] we have now the same position brought about which occurs in
the evans gambit.
[b] if he had taken the p., black, by taking the k. b. p. with his
b., checking, and when the k. took the b., playing q. to k. r's th (ch.),
would have gained a more valuable p. in return, and have
deprived his opponent of the privilege of castling.

[a] white gains a move by this exchange of pieces.
[b] p. to k. r's d would have been better play.
[c] this is very finely played, and is an example to young players
of the importance of gaining time at chess. had white paused in
his attack to recover the lost bishop, the adversary might have succeeded
in dislodging one or other of the pieces by which he is beleaguered,
or in bringing his own forces to the rescue, and then have
ultimately retrieved the game.

an attentive consideration of the foregoing examples
will lead you to the conclusion, i think, that the salvio
defence, or that of cochrane, which varies from it in the
transposition of black's th and th moves, is a safe and
trustworthy method of opposing the king's gambit, and
that the danger to be apprehended by the second player, in
advancing his pawn to k. kt's th on the th move, is
not that his opponent should play the kt. to k's th, and
admit of the salvio or cochrane defence, but that he
should leave his kt. to be taken, and adopt the powerful
and almost irresistible attack of the muzio gambit.

the muzio gambit.
in the two defences to the king's gambit by salvio
and cochrane just examined, when the second player for
his fourth move advances his p. to k. kt's th, attacking
the knight, white replies by moving his knight to
king's th, subjecting himself, as was shown, to a counter-attack,
from which escape without loss is difficult if not
impracticable. from this circumstance, apparently,
originated the conception of the "muzio gambit," wherein
the first player instead of removing the attacked knight
boldly abandons him, and by castling is enabled to bring
an almost overwhelming array of forces to the immediate
assault of the adverse king.

our examination of this gambit would be imperfect
without some notice of a variation in the opening, where
the first player, instead of abandoning the knight at his
th move, sacrifices his bishop by taking the k. b. pawn,
checking. this attack is not, strictly speaking, a part
of the muzio gambit, but it is so intimately associated
with it that i think it better to consider them both under
the same head.

in the previous games we have followed out, at some
length, the most prominent variations which occur when
[]both the attack and defence in this opening are conducted
upon the principles recommended by the best authorities,
and the result would seem to prove that against every
system of attack in the king's bishop's gambit at present
known, the defence, though difficult and complex in the
extreme, is satisfactory.
it yet remains for us to consider what are the probable
deviations from the several standard methods of defence,
and in what manner these should be turned to advantage
by the opening player.

[a] notes by w. steinitz.—white's game has been modelled chiefly
after steinitz's favorite attack. here, however, . p. takes p. is preferable,
for if ... p. takes p; . b. to kt's th, b. to kt's d;
. kt. to k's th, with a strong attack.
[b] as often shown in my annotations in similar positions, it is absolutely
injurious to white's game to allow three well-supportable pawns
against two to be established on the queen's side. the prospect of a
king's side attack on which white speculates is quite unreliable in
comparison to the disadvantage on the queen's side to which he is
subjected. at any rate, pawns ought to be exchanged first, and thus
black's centre weakened.
[c] it was better to make sure of his superiority on the queen's side by
p. to b's th at once.
[d] he had sufficient force on the king's side to ignore any hostile attack
in that direction, and systematic operations on the other wing,
commencing with p. to q. kt's th, were most in order.
[e] the combination of this with the next five moves, more especially
with the two closely following, is full of high ingenuity, which, however,
is wasted on an imaginary danger. for all purposes of defence
it was only necessary to advance p. to k. kt's d at the right time,
and then to play r. to b's d, followed by b. to k. b's sq. eventually.
the queen's wing was still the proper point of attack to which he
should have directed his attention more promptly.
[f] for aggressive purposes on the queen's side, the queen was better
placed at b's d.
[g] this rash attack and black's timid reply were only to be accounted
for as results of time pressure on both sides.
[h] there was not the slightest danger in capturing the pawn with a
pawn ahead, while this loses one.
[i] a fatal miscalculation. r. to q. b's th led to a most probable draw,
for if ... r. to kt's th; . q. to b's th (ch.), &c.
[j] black seizes his opportunity with scientific exactitude.

[a] marshall abandons his favorite variation . q. to b's d.
[b] janowsky also changes p. to b's th, played in the earlier games.
[c] janowsky's favorite manœuvre, which might have been expected.
therefore marshall could have played p. takes p. previous to b. to q's d.
[d] p. to q. r's th would have prevented the bishop being dislodged;
but as he manages eventually to prevent black from keeping the majority
of pawns on the queen's side, there is nothing to be said against
it—except that he only keeps about an even game.
[e] this is compulsory, because of the threat p. to b's th, followed by
p. to kt's th.
[f] b. to kt's sq. might be followed by p. to kt's th, when q. to k's sq.
would take up the place which the k. r. intends to occupy; but
the move would have been better, nevertheless.
[g] it is doubtful whether the advance might not have been dispensed
with, because of the threat kt. to q's d, kt's d, and b's th eventually.
but marshall plays still for attack, not content with a draw in
an even position.
[h] black has now the better game.
[i] better would have been ... q. to b's d . q. to kt's d,
k. r. to b's sq.; . r. takes q., q. takes r., with the command of the

[j] notes by l. hoffer.—q. to b's d could be played here.
[k] an alternative would be ... q. to b's d; . p. to k's th,

. b. takes q., kt. to q's d, winning the k. p.
[l] q. to q's d or q. to b's d could be played. the text move gives
white a chance to bring his queen effectively into play.
[m] kt. to k's sq. would have been safer.
[n] marshall did not expect this complaisance, and janowsky would
not have obliged him had he seen the fatal . q. to r's th.
... kt. takes k. p. should have been played.
[o] marshall risked losing the game in trying to win. his boldness
was rewarded, but the verdict should be: don't try it again.

[a] the best line of play against the mccutcheon defence. it was
played in a game sjöberg vs. giersing, stockholm, .
[b] out of place in this position. q. kt. to q's d or kt. to k's th,
would be alternatives—the former move in preference.
[c] this excellent move was probably not taken into consideration by
tarrasch when advancing p. to b's th.
[d] if .., p. takes p., then . r. takes p., and black could not challenge
the queen with .., q. to q. b's th, because of . r. to q. b's th.
nor could .., k. to k's d be played, because of . p. takes p., and
.., q. takes b. p. would be answered with . r. takes kt. winning
the queen, and as the continuation in the text is hopeless, there remains
the only alternative of .., castles, with a good enough game,
all things considered.
[e] simply position play. black's forces are paralyzed, and the king
fixed on the middle of the centre.
[f] q. to b's d at once seems comparatively better, and if necessary
castles, and the case is not altogether hopeless.
[g] not a judicious capture, to say the least.
[h] this move, or resigning. there is nothing else. the latter course
would be more to the purpose, unless a miracle is expected.

and black surrenders, after a struggle of nearly nine hours.
[a] a very ingenious move. if black take the pawn with his
queen, he of course loses her by "b. takes q. r. p. (ch.), etc." and
if with the kt. it costs him at least a piece.

and black wins.
[a] a favorite move with several of the strongest of modern players.
[b] if white take p. with p., the black k. b. is brought into play;
and if not, the advance of p. to b's th is threatened.
[c] chiefly to double white's pawns.
[d] black foresaw the intended attack on the b. p., and by providing
for it in this way brought another piece into action.
[e] white keeps up the attack on the b. p. with a great deal of vigor.
the move of r. p. two was a very good one.
[f] the best move.
[g] the r. is well posted—for attack and defence.
[h] black has now resumed the offensive.
[i] threatening to take q. if p. takes p., and attacking q. r. at the
same time. there was still another motive for this move, viz.: to
induce white to take r. p., foreseeing the r. would be lost subsequently.
[j] to enslave the rook.
[k] an excellent move. in this and the succeeding moves, white
played very well. his efforts were directed to saving his r., but, as
the result showed, without success.
[l] apparently hazardous, but justified by the gain of time.
[m] we believe his best move.
[n] white was obliged to lose the exchange, although he fought
manfully against it.
[o] another very good move in white.
[p] black's advantage in the exchange begins now to tell on the
game.

[d] allowing the escape of the knight.

and black abandoned the game.
[a] a favorite move of mr. harrwitz, though decried by the chief
authorities.
[b] had he taken the queen's pawn, white would have won at least
the exchange by moving kt. to q's th.
[c] fearing to take the bishop lest white should obtain an entrance
with the rook.
[d] all this is exceedingly well played by white.
[e] the coup juste. from this point it would not be easy to improve
on white's moves.
[f] better, perhaps, to have played the rook to q. r's sq. at once.

[a] the ingenious attack instituted hereby was invented by zukertort.
[b] . p. takes b., kt. to b's d!; . q. takes r. (ch.), obtains three
pieces for the q., but loses the game. q. to k's sq., here or on the following
move, offers the only defence.
[c] zukertort's analysis, which filled pages and pages of the neue berliner
schachzeitung, considered every conceivable move of white's down to
p. to q. r's d, but this one, upon which, in conjunction with the following
k. move, steinitz rested his gambit. . p. to b's d has been
refuted in an elaborate analysis by mr. walter penn shipley, of
philadelphia.
[d] black wins here by,
. .... p. to q. r's d.

as played by messrs. honegger and raubitscheck in a consultation
game against steinitz at the metropolitan chess club, . if, instead
of k. to kt's d, . kt. takes p. black wins by r. takes p.!.
[e] white has brought his k. into safety and will remain a piece
ahead. had black, instead of his last move, pinned the b., the game
would have proceeded as follows:
. .... r. to kt's d.
. p. to q. r's th.. p. to q. r's d.
. b. takes p.. r. takes p.
. k. to b's d.. p. takes b.
. p. takes p.. q. takes p.
. b. takes p. (ch.) and wins.
to play with correctness and skill the ends of games, is an important
but a very rare accomplishment, except among the very best
players. in order to assist the learner as much as possible in this
branch of the game, we present a number of end positions, with the
proper play necessary in each case. our selection of positions is
necessarily very limited; but those we give will serve to show the
careful play that is requisite even when the stronger party feels sure
of success, and the danger of defeat if he suffer his vigilance to be
relaxed for a moment.

the two knights, with the assistance of the king,
cannot force checkmate, except in some very rare cases.
when one pawn only is left on the board, supported by its king,
and the adverse king is either in front of the pawn, or within such
distance as to be able to intercept it, it becomes a point of great
nicety in some cases, to calculate whether or not you have the power
of queening the pawn, and therefore of winning the game. this
frequently depends upon your gaining the opposition, which you cannot
always do.
in the next position (see diagram ) you have the opposition, and
if black have to play you will win. thus:—
. k. to his sq.
. p. to k's th.. k. to his d.
. k. to b's th, and
. p. queens.
but if you move first, the game is drawn; for if you play p. to k's th (ch.),
black moves king to his square, and you must either
abandon the pawn or give stalemate. you will find, on trial, that
any other mode of play on your part will produce the same result,—from
which is deduced this important general rule: that if you can
advance the pawn to its th sq., not giving check, you will win; but
that if the pawn checks at this point, you will only draw.
in this position (see diagram ), you will win either with or without
the move; for if black have to play, he is forced to allow your
king to be moved either to b's th or q's th sq.; and if you move
you gain the opposition, by playing k. to b's th or q's th, and
then p. to k's th. it is evident that this would equally hold good
if your pawn were any number of squares less advanced; so that
you invariably win, if you can succeed in placing your king on the
sixth square of the file occupied by your pawn, and in front of it;
provided, of course, that the single king cannot attack the pawn, so
as to compel you to retreat in order to support it. it is perhaps
scarcely necessary to observe, that if the pawn be upon either of the
rooks' files, these remarks will not apply—this contingency will be
considered hereafter.

. k. to his sq., or to b's sq.

and then advances pawn, winning.
next, suppose black has the move, and he will draw:—
. k. to k's d.
. k. to q's d.. k. to his d.
. k. to his d.. k. to his th.
. k. to q's d.. k. to q's th.
. p. to k's d, orto k's th. (ch.). k. to k's th.
and it is clear that, play as you may, you can only draw the game.
the only exception in all the foregoing cases is to be found, as has
already been remarked, when the pawn is upon either of the rooks'
files. in these instances, black will invariably draw the game when
his king can be placed on any part of the file in front of the pawn,
it being quite immaterial at what distance the adverse king and
pawn may be. even, as in the next example, the player of the single
king will draw the game, if he have not the move, against two pawns
in a somewhat similar position. for white being to move, he can
only play k. to r's th, to which black must reply by k. to b's sq.;
and if white then advance b's pawn, it will be taken: or if he play
r's pawn, black returns k. to b's d, and his adversary is stalemated.
(see diagram .)
two united pawns, with their king, always win against king alone.
another advantage in having two pawns thus situated is, that they
can always maintain themselves until the arrival of the king to their
support; for should one be taken, the other will advance to queen.
in the next position (see diagram ), white wins by advancing
k. to kt's th, then queening rook's pawn, and upon that being taken,
playing k. to r's th, or b's th, having the opposition.
(in all cases, each party is of course understood
to have a king in addition to the pieces named.)

[a] this is the position which white must endeavor to gain, in
order that he may force the king to his queen's th, in front of the
pawn.
the queen usually wins against two of the minor pieces, at least
if they are on different parts of the board, or at a distance from their
king. there are, however, many instances in which, by skilful
play, the weaker force may draw the game.
the two bishops will be able to draw when they can assume a
position similar to that in diagram , or in other words, such a position
in front of their king, that the adverse king cannot approach.

in cases of this kind the game is usually drawn without difficulty,
and most generally so by means of a perpetual check, though the
same object may sometimes be attained by an exchange of queens,
when your king is able to stop the pawn. when, however, the pawn
is advanced to its th square, and more particularly if defended by
its king, the task is one of more difficulty, and many instructive
situations occur where the pawn may be queened and the game
therefore won. we subjoin an example or two of each kind, by way
of illustration.

then forces an exchange of queens, and wins with his remaining pawn.
in all ordinary situations, the queen of course easily stops a single
pawn and wins against it; if, however, the latter has reached its th
square, and has the support of its king, there are instances in which
the game must be drawn. our first position (see diagram ), will
show the method of winning, and we shall afterwards point out the
exceptions.

the same mode of procedure can always be adopted, unless the
single pawn should be either on the bishop's or rook's file, in which
case black may usually make a drawn game, owing to the power
which he then has of making a stalemate. his having this alternative,
however, altogether depends upon the distance which the adverse
king may chance to be from the scene of action. in the next position
(diagram ) the game is drawn.

and it is evident, that if white take the pawn, his adversary is
stalemated.
the result is the same when the pawn is on the rook's file, as you
will at once see by making the experiment.
the next position (see diagram ), is a very ingenious exception
to this rule, and will well repay your attention.

in ordinary positions, and where the knight is near to, or cannot
be prevented approaching, his king, the weaker party will be able
to draw the game. the method of doing so, however, is not very
easy, and there are many positions (of which we shall give an
