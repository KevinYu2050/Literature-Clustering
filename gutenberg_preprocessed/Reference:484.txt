. the most skillful gauger i ever knew was a maligned
 cobbler, armed with a poniard, who drove a peddler's wagon,
 using a mullein stalk as an instrument of coercion to tyrannize
 over his pony shod with calks. he was a galilean sadducee, and
 he had a phthisicky catarrh, diphtheria, and the bilious
 intermittent
 erysipelas.[pg ]
. a certain sibyl, with the sobriquet of "gypsy," went into
 ecstasies of cachinnation at seeing him measure a bushel of
 peas and separate saccharine tomatoes from a heap of peeled
 potatoes, without dyeing or singeing the ignitible queue which
 he wore, or becoming paralyzed with hemorrhage.
. lifting her eyes to the ceiling of the cupola of the
 capitol to conceal her unparalleled embarrassment, making him a
 rough courtesy, and not harrassing him with mystifying,
 rarefying, and stupefying innuendoes, she gave him a couch, a
 bouquet of lilies, mignonette, and fuchsias, a treatise on
 mnemonics, a copy of the apocrypha in hieroglyphics,
 daguerreotypes of mendelssohn and kosciusko, a kaleidoscope, a
 dram-phial of ipecacuanha, a teaspoonful of naphtha for deleble
 purposes, a ferrule, a clarionet, some licorice, a surcingle, a
 carnelian of symmetrical proportions, a chronometer with a
 movable balance-wheel, a box of dominoes, and a catechism.
. the gauger, who was also a trafficking rectifier and a
 parishioner of mine, preferring a woolen surtout (his choice
 was referrible to a vacillating, occasionally occurring
 idiosyncrasy), wofully uttered this apothegm: "life is
 checkered; but schism, apostasy, heresy and villainy shall be
 punished." the sibyl apologizingly answered: "there is a
 ratable and allegeable difference between a conferrable
 ellipsis and a trisyllabic diæresis." we replied in trochees,
 not impugning her suspicion.
. one enervating morning, just after the rise of the sun, a
 youth bearing the cognomen of galileo glided into his gondola
 over the legendary waters of the lethean thames. he was
 accompanied by his allies and coadjutors, the dolorous pepys
 and the erudite cholmondeley, the most combative aristocrat
 extant, and an epicurean who, for learned vagaries and
 revolting discrepancies of character, would take precedence of
 the most erudite of all areopagite
 literati.[pg ]
. these sacrilegious dramatis personæ were
 discussing in detail a suggestive and exhaustive address,
 delivered from the proscenium box of the calisthenic lyceum by
 a notable financier on obligatory hydropathy, as accessory to
 the irrevocable and irreparable doctrine of evolution, which
 had been vehemently panegyrized by a splenetic professor of
 acoustics, and simultaneously denounced by a complaisant
 opponent as an undemonstrated romance of the last decade,
 amenable to no reasoning, however allopathic, outside of its
 own lamentable environs.
. these peremptory tripartite brethren arrived at
 greenwich, wishing to aggrandize themselves by indulging in
 exemplary relaxation, indicatory of implacable detestation of
 integral tergiversation and exoteric intrigue. they fraternized
 with a phrenological harlequin who was a connoisseur in
 mezzotint and falconry. the piquant person was heaping
 contumely and scathing raillery on an amateur in jugular
 recitative, who held that the pharaohs of asia were conversant
 with his theory that morphine and quinine were exorcists of
 bronchitis.
. meanwhile, the leisurely augustine of cockburn drank from
 a tortoise-shell wassail cup to the health of an apotheosized
 recusant, who was his supererogatory patron, and an assistant
 recognizance in the immobile nomenclature of interstitial
 molecular phonics. the contents of the vase proving soporific,
 a stolid plebeian took from its cerements a heraldic
 violoncello, and, assisted by a plethoric diocesan from pall
 mall, who performed on a sonorous piano-forte, proceeded to
 wake the clangorous echoes of the empyrean. they bade the
 prolyx caucasian gentlemen not to misconstrue their inexorable
 demands, while they dined on acclimated anchovies and apricot
 truffles, and had for dessert a wiseacre's pharmacopoeia. thus
 the truculent pythagoreans had a novel repast fit for the
 gods.
. on the subsidence of the feast they alternated between
 soft languors and isolated scenes of squalor, which followed a
 [pg ] mechanist's reconnaissance of
 the imagery of uranus, the legend of whose incognito related
 to a poniard wound in the abdomen received while cutting a
 swath in the interests of telegraphy and posthumous
 photography. meantime an unctuous orthoepist applied a
 homeopathic restorative to the retina of an objurgatory
 spaniel (named daniel) and tried to perfect the construction
 of a behemoth which had got mired in pygmean slough, while
 listening to the elegiac soughing of the prehistoric
 wind.
. geoffrey, surnamed winthrop, sat in the depot at chicago,
 waiting for his train and reading the tribune, when a squadron
 of street arabs (incomparable for squalor) thronged from a
 neighboring alley, uttering hideous cries, accompanied by
 inimitable gestures of heinous exultation, as they tortured a
 humble black-and-tan dog.
. "you little blackguards!" cried winthrop, stepping
 outside and confronting them, adding the inquiry, "whose dog is
 that?"
. "that audacious caucasian has the bravado to interfere
 with our clique," tauntingly shrieked the indisputable little
 ruffian, exhibiting combativeness.
. "what will you take for him?" asked the lenient geoffrey,
 ignoring the venial tirade.
. "twenty-seven cents," piquantly answered the ribald
 urchin, grabbing the crouching dog by the nape.
. "you can buy licorice and share with the indecorous
 coadjutors of your condemnable cruelty," said winthrop, paying
 the price and taking the dog from the child. then catching up
 his valise and umbrella he hastened to his train. winthrop
 satisfied himself that his sleek protege was not wounded, and
 then cleaned the cement from the pretty collar, and read these
 words; "leicester. licensed, no.
 ."[pg ]
. hearing the pronunciation of his name, the docile canine
 expressed gratitude and pleasure, and then sank exhausted at
 his new patron's feet and slept.
. among the other passengers was a magazine contributor,
 writing vagaries of indian literature, also two physicians, a
 somber, irrevocable, irrefragable allopathist, and a genial
 homeopathist, who made a specialty of bronchitis. two
 peremptory attorneys from the legislature of iowa were
 discussing the politics of the epoch and the details of
 national finance, while a wan, dolorous person, wearing concave
 glasses, alternately ate troches and almonds for a sedative,
 and sought condolence in a high, lamentable treble from a
 lethargic and somewhat deaf and enervate comrade not yet
 acclimated.
. near three exemplary brethren (probably sinecurists) sat
 a group of humorous youths; and a jocose sailor (lately from
 asia) in a blouse waist and tarpaulin hat was amusing his
 patriotic, juvenile listeners by relating a series of the most
 extraordinary legends extant, suggested by the contents of the
 knapsack which he was calmly and leisurely arranging in a
 pyramidal form on a three-legged stool. above swung figured
 placards, with museum and lyceum advertisements, too verbose to
 be misconstrued.
. a mature matron of medium height, and her comely
 daughter, soon entered the car, and took seats in front of
 winthrop (who recalled having seen them on tuesday, in
 february, in the parquet of a theater). the young lady had
 recently made her debut into society at a musical soiree at her
 aunt's. she had an exquisite bouquet of flowers that exhaled
 sweet perfume. she said to her parent, "mamma, shall we ever
 find my lost leicester?"
. geoffrey immediately addressed her, saying, as he
 presented his card—
"pardon my apparent intrusiveness; but, prithee, have you
 lost a pet dog?"[pg ]
. the explanation that he had been stolen was scarcely
 necessary, for leicester, just awakening, vehemently expressed
 his inexplicable joy by buoyantly vibrating between the two
 like the sounding lever used in telegraphy (for to neither of
 them would he show partiality), till, succumbing to ennui, he
 purported to take a recess, and sat on his haunches,
 complaisantly contemplating his friends. it was truly an
 interesting picture.
. they reached their destination ere the sun was beneath
 the horizon. often during the summer winthrop gallantly rowed
 from the quay, with the naive and blithe beatrice in her jaunty
 yachting suit, but no coquetry shone from the depths of her
 azure eyes. little less, their jocund confidante and courier
 (and who was as sagacious as a spaniel), always attended them
 on these occasions, and whene'er they rambled through the
 woodland paths. while the band played strains from beethoven
 mendelssohn, bach and others, they promenaded the long
 corridors of the hotel. and one evening, as beatrice lighted
 the gas by the etagere in her charming boudoir in their suite
 of rooms, there glistened brilliantly a valuable solitaire
 diamond on her finger.
. let us look into the future for the sequel to perfect
 this romance, and around a cheerful hearth we see again
 geoffrey and beatrice, who are paying due homage to their tiny
 friend leicester.
. a sacrilegious son of belial, who suffered from
 bronchitis and diphtheria, and had taken much morphine and
 quinine, having exhausted his finances, in order to make good
 the deficit, resolved to ally himself to a complaisant,
 lenient, docile, young woman of the caucasian race. buying a
 calliope, a coral necklace, an illustrated magazine, and a
 falcon [pg ] from asia, he took a suite of
 rooms, whose acoustic properties were excellent, and engaged
 a malay as his coadjutor.
. being of an epicurean disposition, he threw the culinary
 department of his hotel into confusion by ordering for his
 dinner vermicelli soup, a bologna sausage, anchovies, calf's
 brains fried, and half a gooseberry pie. for the resulting
 dyspepsia he took acetic and tartaric acid, according to
 allopathy, and when his aunt, a fair matron of six decades,
 called, he was tyrannic and combative, and laughed like a
 brigand until she was obliged to succumb to his contumacy.
. etiquette being thus annihilated, he became amenable to
 tenderer passions. he sent a letter, inviting his inamorata to
 a matinee, together with an eighteen-carat gold ring. she
 revolted at the idea of accompanying him, and sent a note full
 of piquant raillery, which led her suitor to procure a carbine
 and a sword, with some apparatus, and to declare that he would
 not forge hymeneal chains upon any one.
. so proceeding to an isolated spot, without comrades, he
 severed his jugular vein, and discharged the carbine into his
 abdomen. when inquiry was made, he was found dead, and the
 coroner sat on the debris and did his exact duty, though it was
 no couch of eider he occupied.
. had the misguided youth read ovid less often, and given
 precedence to hemans and ingelow, his fate might have been
 different. true, he might have hung on a greasy gallows like a
 highwayman, in squalor, and been the sport of canines for aye;
 while now, disarmed by death, he lies in a splendid mausoleum,
 far from the wharves and haunts of men, and can't accent his
 antepenults, and afford the greatest discrepancies extant in
 pronunciation.[pg ]
. learned sages may reason, the fluent may
 talk,
but they ne'er can compute what we owe to
 the chalk.
from the embryo mind of the infant of
 four,
to the graduate, wise in collegiate
 lore;
from the old district school-house to
 harvard's proud hall,
the chalk rules with absolute sway over
 all.
. go, enter the school-room of primary grade,
and see how conspicuous the blackboard is
 made.
the teacher makes letters and calls them
 by name,
and says to the children, "now all do the
 same;"
mere infants you see, scarcely able to
 walk,
but none are too feeble to handle the
 chalk.
. we visit the school of much higher
 pretension,
the blackboard here claims undivided
 attention;
the walls, dark as erebus, first greet
 the eye,
before them bright misses and lads we
 espy;
and the sound of the crayon's irregular
 tappings
reminds us of spirits' mysterious
 rappings.
. one has pictured a vessel, with streamers
 unfurled,
another is making a map of the world;
a third has a problem in fractions to
 solve,
a fourth is explaining how planets
 revolve;
while a young physiologist, skilled in
 the art,
is sketching the muscles, the lungs, and
 the heart.
. in the midst of this bustle the school-master
 stands,
and, lo! he's a crayon in each of his
 hands;
and the chalk in his hand has a
 magical power:
a teacher might reason and talk by the
 hour,
but naught would avail all his reason and
 talk—
the truth is made plain by the use of the
 chalk.
[pg ]
. and the teacher of music the blackboard
 employs,
the chalk must be used e'en in training
 the voice;
be it rhythm or melody, accent or
 force,
he always insists on the regular
 course;
declaring the secret of musical skill
is found in the blackboard, the chalk,
 and the drill.
. see the chalk in the hand of the artist.
 behold
what beauteous forms as by magic
 unfold!
the store-house of nature he swiftly
 displays,
till the dazzled beholder is lost in the
 maze;
designs without number appear to the
 view,
and show what the chalk and the
 blackboard can do.
. o wise pestalozzi! we place on thy brow
a coronet, bright and unfading; for
 thou
a legacy rich hast bequeathed unto
 men:
our one feeble talent by thee is
 made ten;
we prize thy rare gift, but we never may
 know
how much to thy matchless invention we
 owe.
. o chalk! what a powerful monarch thou art!
in this age of reform how important thy
 part;
those minds that are swaying the world
 unrestrained
in childhood and youth in thy empire were
 trained.
of the wonderful power of the press we
 may talk—
it never can vie with the blackboard and
 chalk.
. an engine so powerful, so mighty to aid,
so simple in structure, so readily
 made,
a helper so potent in training the
 young—
'tis meet that thy praise by the muse
 should be sung;
for though sages may reason, and orators
 talk,
they can ne'er make their mark without
 blackboard and chalk.
