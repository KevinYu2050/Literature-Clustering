himself in the times as possessing a degree of the paris
university. the old universities belong to the time before the
deluge—that means before the revolution of . the university of
france is the organized whole of the higher and middle institutions of
learning, in so far as they are directed by the state, not the clergy.
it is an institution more governmental, according to the genius of the
country, than our london university, to which, however, its organization
bears some resemblance. to speak of it in one breath with oxford or
aberdeen is to commit the ... error of confounding two things, or
placing them on the same line, because they have the same name.”

truth is that, in his account of oxford and its early days, mr hallam
quotes john of salisbury, not as asserting that vacarius taught there,
but as making “no mention of oxford at all”; while he gives for the
statement about the law school no authority whatever beyond his general
reference throughout to anthony wood. but the fact is as historical as a
fact can well be, and the authority for it is a passage in one of the
best of the contemporary authors, gervaise of canterbury. “tunc leges et
causidici in angliam primo vocati sunt,” he says in his account of
theobald in the acts of the archbishops, “quorum primus erat

edw.iv.:
“the maior of this cite commaundeth on the kynges bihalve,

grene refer to the change on easter sunday described in the liber

that this day

is called in many places god’s sunday. know well that it is the manner
in every place of worship at this day to do the fire out of the
hall; and the black winter brands, and all thing that is foul with
smoke shall be done away, and there the fire was, shall be gaily arrayed
with fair flowers, and strewed with green rushes all about, showing a
great ensample to all christian people, like as they make clean their
houses to the sight of the people, in the same wise ye should cleanse
your souls, doing away the foul brenning (burning) sin of lechery; put
all these away, and cast out all thy smoke, dusts; and strew in your
souls flowers of faith and charity, and thus make your souls able to
receive your lord god at the feast of easter.” —rock’s church
of the future, v. iii. pt. , p.. “the holly, being an
evergreen, would be more fit for the purpose, and makes less litter,
than the boughs of deciduous trees. iknow some old folks in
herefordshire who yet follow the custom, and keep the grate filled with
flowers and foliage till late in the autumn.” —d.r. on
shere-thursday, or cena domini, dr rock quotes from the liber
festivalis—“first if a man asked why sherethursday is called
so, ye may say that in holy church it is called ‘cena domini,’ our
lord’s supper day; for that day he supped with his disciples openly....
it is also in english called sherethursday; for in old fathers’ days the
people would that day sheer their heads and clip their beards, and poll
their heads, and so make them honest against easter-day.” —rock,

in the name of the father, son, and holy ghost, god keep me! i am an
usher to a prince, and delight in teaching the inexperienced.
it is charitable to teach ignorant youths.
if any such won’t learn, give them a toy.
one may i went to a forest, and by the forester’s leave walked in the
woodland, where i saw three herds of deer in the sunshine.
a young man with a bow was going to stalk them, but i asked him to
walk with me, and inquired whom he served.
‘no one but myself, and i wish i was out of this world.’
‘good son, despair is sin; tell me what the matter is. when the pain
is greatest the cure is nearest!’
‘sir, i’ve tried everywhere for a master; but because i know nothing,
no one will take me.’
‘will you learn if i’ll teach you? what do you want to be?’
‘a butler, sir, panter, chamberlain, and carver. teach me the duties
of these.’
‘i will, if you’ll love god and be true to your master.’
a panter or butler must have three knives:
 to chop loaves,  to pare them,  to smooth the trenchers.
give your sovereign new bread, others one-day-old bread; for the
house, three-day bread; for trenchers four-day bread; have your salt
white, and your salt-planer of ivory, two inches broad, three long.
have your table linen sweet and clean, your knives bright, spoons
well washed, two wine-augers some box taps, a broaching gimlet, a pipe
and bung.
to broach a pipe, pierce it with an auger or gimlet, four fingers-
breadth over the lower rim, so that the dregs may not rise.
serve fruit according to the season, figs, dates, quince-marmalade,
ginger, &c.
before dinner, plums and grapes after, pears, nuts, and hard
cheese.
after supper, roast apples, &c.
in the evening don’t take cream, strawberries, or junket, unless you
eat hard cheese with them.
hard cheese keeps your bowels open.
butter is wholesome in youth and old age, anti-poisonous, and
aperient.
milk, junket, posset, &c., are binding.
eat hard cheese after them.
beware of green meat; it weakens your belly.
for food that sets your teeth on edge, eat almonds and cheese, but
not more than half an ounce.
if drinks have given you indigestion, eat a raw apple.
moderation is best sometimes, at others abstinence.
look every night that your wines don’t ferment or leak always carry a
gimlet, adze, and linen cloths; and wash the heads of the pipes with
cold water.
if the wine boil over, put to it the lees of red wine, and that will
cure it.
romney will bring round sick sweet wine.
the names of sweet wines.
recipe for making ypocras.
take spices thus, cinnamon, &c., long pepper.
have three basins and three straining-bags to them; hang ’em on a
perch.
let your ginger be well pared, hard, not worm-eaten, (colombyne is
better than valadyne or maydelyne); your sticks of cinnamon thin, hot
and sweet; canel is not so good.
cinnamon is hot and dry, cardamons are hot and moist.
take sugar or sugar candy, red wine, graines, ginger, pepper,
cinnamon, spice, and turnesole, and put each powder in a bladder by
itself.
hang your straining-bags so that they mayn’t touch,--first bag a
gallon, others a pottle.
put the powders in two or three gallons of red wine; then into the
runner, the second bag, (tasting and trying it now and then), and the
third vessel.
if it’s not right, add cinnamon, ginger, or sugar, as wanted.
if it’s not right, add cinnamon, ginger, or sugar, as wanted.
mind you keep tasting it.
strain it through bags of fine cloth, hooped at the mouth, the first
holding a gallon, the others a pottle, and each with a basin under
it.
the ypocras is made.
use the dregs in the kitchen.
put the ypocras in a tight clean vessel, and serve it with
wafers.
the buttery.
keep all cups, &c., clean.
don’t serve ale till it’s five days old.
be civil and obliging, and give no one stale drink.
to lay the cloth, &c.
wipe the table.
put a cloth on it (a cowche); you take one end, your mate the other;
lay the fold of the second cloth(?) on the outer edge of the table, that
of the third cloth(?) on the inner.
cover your cupboard with a diaper towel, put one round your neck, one
side on your left arm with your sovereign’s napkin; on that, eight
loaves to eat, and three or four trencher loaves: in your left the
salt-cellar.
in your right hand, spoons and knives.
put the salt on the right of your lord; on its left, a trencher or
two; on their left, a knife, then white rolls, and beside them a spoon
folded in a napkin.
cover all up.
at the other end set a salt and two trenchers.
how to wrap up your lord’s bread in a stately way.
cut your loaves all equal.
take a towel two and a half yards long by the ends, fold up a handful
from each end, and in the middle of the folds lay eight loaves or buns,
bottom to bottom; put a wrapper on the top, twist the ends of the towel
together, smooth your wrapper, and quickly open the end of it before
your lord.
after your lord’s lay the other tables.
deck your cupboard with plate, your washing-table with basins,
&c.
have plenty of napkins, &c., and your pots clean.
make the surnape with a cloth under a double napkin.
fold the two ends of your towel, and one of the cloth, a foot over,
and lay it smooth for your lord to wash with.
the marshal must slip it along the table, and pull it smooth.
then raise the upper part of the towel, and lay it even, so that the
sewer (arranger of dishes) may make a state.
when your lord has washed, take up the surnape with your two arms,
and carry it back to the ewery.
carry a towel round your neck.
uncover your bread; see that all diners have knife, spoon, and
napkin.

plenty of bread and drink.
be lively and soft-spoken, clean and well dressed.
don’t spit or put your fingers into cups.
stop all blaming and backbiting, and prevent complaints.
general directions for behaviour.
don’t claw your back as if after a flea; or your head, as if after a
louse.
see that your eyes are not blinking and watery.
don’t pick your nose, or let it drop, or blow it too loud, or twist
your neck.
don’t claw your cods, rub your hands, pick your ears, retch, or spit
too far.
don’t tell lies, or squirt with your mouth, gape, pout, or put your
tongue in a dish to pick dust out.

stern guns, or expose your codware before your master.

fish, and flesh.’
‘hold your knife tight, with two fingers and a thumb, in your
midpalm.

left.
don’t dirty your table or wipe your knives on it.

and another on the top.
take a loaf of light bread, pare the edges, cut the upper crust for
your lord, and don’t touch it after it’s trimmed.
keep your table clean.
indigestibilities.
you must know what meat is indigestible, and what sauces are
wholesome.
these things are indigestible: fat and fried, raw and resty, salt and
sour, also sinews, skin, hair, feathers, crops, heads, pinions, &c.,
legs, outsides of thighs, skins; these destroy your lord’s rest.’
‘thanks, father, i’ll put your teaching into practice, and pray for
you.

separate the sides from the chine, put them together again, cutting out
the nape of the neck; give your lord the sides.
sucking rabbits: cut in two, then the hind part in two; pare the skin

such is the way of carving gross meats.
cut each piece into four slices (?) for your master to dip in his
sauce.
of large birds’ wings, put only three bits at once in the sauce.

“fair fall you, father! you have taught me lovesomely; but please
tell me, too, the duties of a chamberlain.”
the chamberlain’s duties.
he must be diligent, neatly dressed, clean-washed, careful of fire
and candle, attentive to his master, light of ear, looking out for
things that will please.
the chamberlain must prepare for his lord a clean shirt, under and
upper coat and doublet, breeches, socks, and slippers as brown as a
water-leech.
in the morning, must have clean linen ready, warmed by a clear
fire.
when his lord rises, he gets ready the foot-sheet; puts a cushioned
chair before the fire, a cushion for the feet, and over all spreads the
foot-sheet: has a comb and kerchief ready, and then asks his lord to
come to the fire and dress while he waits by.
. give your master his under coat,
. his doublet,
. stomacher well warmed,
. vampeys and socks,
. draw on his socks, breeches, and shoes,
. pull up his breeches,
. tie ’em up,
. lace his doublet,
. put a kerchief round his neck,
. comb his head with an ivory comb,
. give him warm water to wash with,
. kneel down and ask him what gown he’ll wear:
. get the gown,
. hold it out to him;
. get his girdle,
. his robe.
. his hood or hat.
. before he goes brush him carefully.
before your lord goes to church, see that his pew is made ready,
cushion, curtain, &c.
return to his bedroom, throw off the clothes, beat the featherbed,
see that the fustian and sheets are clean.
cover the bed with a coverlet, spread out the bench covers and
cushions, set up the headsheet and pillow, remove the urinal and basin,
lay carpets round the bed, and with others dress the windows and
cupboard, have a fire laid.
keep the privy sweet and clean, cover the boards with green cloth, so
that no wood shows at the hole; put a cushion there, and have some
blanket, cotton, or linen to wipe on; have a basin, jug, and towel,
ready for your lord to wash when he leaves the privy.
in the wardrobe take care to keep the clothes well, and brush ’em
with a soft brush at least once a week, for fear of moths.
look after your drapery and skinnery.
if your lord will take a nap after his meal, have ready kerchief,
comb, pillow and headsheet (don’t let him sleep too long), water and
towel.
when he goes to bed,
. spread out the footsheet,
. take off your lord’s robe and put it away.
. put a cloak on his back,
. set him on his footsheet,
. pull off his shoes, socks, and breeches,
. throw the breeches over your arm,
. comb his head,
. put on his kerchief and nightcap,
. have the bed, and headsheet, &c., ready,
. draw the curtains,
. set the night-light,
. drive out dogs and cats,

how to prepare a bath.
hang round the roof, sheets full of sweet herbs, have five or six
sponges to sit or lean on, and one great sponge to sit on with a sheet
over and a sponge under his feet.
mind the door’s shut.
with a basinful of hot herbs, wash him with a soft sponge, throw
rose-water on him; let him go to bed.
put his socks and slippers on, stand him on his footsheet, wipe him
dry, take him to bed to cure his troubles.
to make a medicinal bath.
boil together hollyhock centaury, herb-benet, scabious, withy leaves;
throw them hot into a vessel, set your lord on it; let him bear it as
hot as he can, and whatever disease he has will certainly be cured, as
men say.
the duties of an usher and marshal.
he must know the rank and precedence of all people.
. the pope.
. emperor.
. king.
. cardinal.
. prince.
. archbishop.
. royal duke.
ii. bishop, &c.
. viscount.
. mitred abbot.
. three chief justices.
. mayor of london.
iv. (the knight’s rank.)
. cathedral prior, knight bachelor.
. dean, archdeacon.
. master of the rolls.
. puisné judge.
. clerk of the crown.
. mayor of calais.
. doctor of divinity.
. prothonotary.
. pope’s legate.
v. (the squire’s rank.)
. doctor of laws.
. ex-mayor of london.
. serjeant of law.
. masters of chancery.
. preacher.
. masters of arts.
. other religious.
. parsons and vicars.
. parish priests.
. city bailiffs.
. serjeant at arms.
. heralds (the chief herald has first place),
. merchants,
. gentlemen,
. gentlewomen may all eat with squires.
i have now told you the rank of every class, and now i’ll tell you
how they may be grouped at table.
i. pope, king, prince, archbishop and duke.
ii. bishop, marquis, viscount, earl.
iii. the mayor of london, baron, mitred abbot, three chief justices,
speaker, may sit together, two or three at a mess.
iv. the other ranks (three or four to a mess) equal to a knight,
unmitred abbot, dean, master of the rolls, under judges, doctor of
divinity, prothonotary, mayor of calais.
v. other ranks equal to a squire, four to a mess.
serjeants of law, ex-mayor of london, masters of chancery, preachers
and parsons, apprentices of law, merchants and franklins.
each estate or rank shall sit at meat by itself, not seeing
another.
the bishop of canterbury shall be served apart from the archbishop of
york, and the metropolitan alone.
the bishop of york must not eat before the primate of england.
sometimes a marshal is puzzled by lords of royal blood being poor,
and others not royal being rich; also by a lady of royal blood marrying
a knight, and vice versâ.
the lady of royal blood shall keep her rank; the lady of low blood
shall take her husband’s rank.
property is not so worthy as royal blood, so the latter prevails over
the former, for royal blood may become king.
the parents of a pope or cardinal must not presume to equality with
their son, and must not want to sit by him, but in a separate room.
a marshal must look to the rank of every estate, and do honour to
foreign visitors and residents.
a well-trained marshal should think beforehand where to place
strangers at the table.
if the king sends any messenger to your lord receive him one degree
higher than his rank.
the king’s groom may dine with a knight or marshal, a marshal must
also understand the rank of county and borough officers, and that a
knight of blood and property is above a poor knight, the mayor of london
above the mayor of queenborough, the abbot of westminster above the poor
abbot of tintern, the prior of canterbury above the prior of dudley, the
prior who is prelate of a cathedral church above any abbot or prior of
his diocese, a doctor of  years’ standing above one of  (though the
latter be the richer), the old aldermen above the young ones, and
. the master of a craft,
. the ex-warden.
before every feast, then, think what people are coming, and settle
what their order of precedence is to be.
if in doubt, ask your lord or the chief officer, and then you’ll do
wrong to no one, but set all according to their birth and dignity.
now i have told you of court manners, how to manage in pantry,
buttery, carving, and as sewer, and marshal, as i learnt with a royal
prince whose usher and marshal i was.
all other officers have to obey me.
our office is the chief, whether the cook likes it or not.
all these offices may be filled by one man, but a prince’s dignity
requires each office to have its officer, and a servant under him, (all
knowing their duties perfectly) to wait on their lord and please his
guests.
don’t fear to serve a prince; take good heed to your duties, watch,
and you need not fear.
tasting is done only for those of royal blood, as a pope,
king, duke, and earl: not below.
tasting is done for fear of poison; therefore keep your room secure,
and close your safe, for fear of tricks.
a prince’s steward and chamberlain have the oversight of all offices
and of tasting, and they must tell the marshal, sewer, and carver how to
do it.
i don’t propose to write more on this matter.
i tried this treatise myself, in my youth, and enjoyed these matters,
but now age compels me to leave the court; so try yourself.”
“blessing on you, father, for this your teaching of me! now i shall
dare to serve where before i was afraid. i will try, and shall learn by
practice. may god reward you for teaching me!”
“good son, and all readers of this boke of nurture, pray for
the soul of me, john russell, (servant of humphrey, duke of gloucester;)
also for the duke, my wife, father, and mother, that we may all go to
bliss when we die.”
little book, commend me to all learners, and to the experienced, whom
i pray to correct its faults.
any such, put to my copying, which i have done as i best could.
the transcriber is not to blame; he copied what was before him, and
neither of us wrote it, i only corrected the rhyme.
god! grant us grace to rule in heaven with thine elect!

my god, support me while i translate this treatise from latin. it
shall teach those of tender age.
to know and practise virtues is the most profitable thing in the
world.
young babies, adorned with grace, i call on you to know this book
(for nurture should accompany beauty), and not on aged men expert
therein.
why add pain to hell, water to the sea, or heat to fire?
babies, my book is for you only, and so i hope no one will find fault
with it, but only amend it.
the only reward i seek is that my book may please all and improve
you.
if you don’t know any word in it, ask till you do, and then keep hold
of it.
and do not wonder at this being in metre.
i must first describe how you babies who dwell in households should
behave at meals, and be ready with lovely and benign words when you are
spoken to.
lady facetia, help me! thou art the mother of all virtue.
help the ignorance of me untaught!
fair babies, when you enter your lord’s place, say “god speed,” and
salute all there.

have finished; do not chatter or let your eyes wander about the
house.

near.

if any one better than yourself comes in, retire and give place to
him.
turn your back on no man.
be silent while your lord drinks, not laughing, whispering, or

then don’t talk dirt, or scorn any one, but be meek and cheerful.
if your better praises you, rise up and thank him heartily.
when your lord or lady is speaking about the household, don’t you
interfere, but be always ready to serve at the proper time, to bring
drink, hold lights, or anything else, and so get a good name.
the best prayer you can make to god is to be well mannered.

them.

places; keep your seats till you’ve washed; then rise up without
laughing or joking, and go to your lord’s table.

over his hands.
