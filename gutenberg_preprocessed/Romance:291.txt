 custom, and a villainous usance for a queen to use, and namely to make
 such war upon her own lord, that is called the flower of chivalry that is
 christian or heathen; and with all my heart i would destroy that shameful
 custom. and i will that all the world wit she shall have no service of me.
 and if she send out any knights, as i suppose she will, for to joust, they
 shall have both their hands full. and i shall not fail you, said sir
 dinadan, unto my puissance, upon my life.
 so as they stood on horseback afore the castle, there came a knight with a
 red shield, and two squires after him; and he came straight unto sir
 palomides, the good knight, and said to him: fair and gentle
 knight-errant, i require thee for the love thou owest unto knighthood,
 that ye will not have ado here with these men of this castle; for this was
 sir lamorak that thus said. for i came hither to seek this deed, and it is
 my request; and therefore i beseech you, knight, let me deal, and if i be
 beaten revenge me. in the name of god, said palomides, let see how ye will
 speed, and we shall behold you. then anon came forth a knight of the
 castle, and proffered to joust with the knight with the red shield. anon
 they encountered together, and he with the red shield smote him so hard
 that he bare him over to the earth. therewith anon came another knight of
 the castle, and he was smitten so sore that he avoided his saddle. and
 forthwithal came the third knight, and the knight with the red shield
 smote him to the earth. then came sir palomides, and besought him that he
 might help him to joust. fair knight, said he unto him, suffer me as at
 this time to have my will, for an they were twenty knights i shall not
 doubt them. and ever there were upon the walls of the castle many lords
 and ladies that cried and said: well have ye jousted, knight with the red
 shield. but as soon as the knight had smitten them down, his squire took
 their horses, and avoided their saddles and bridles of the horses, and
 turned them into the forest, and made the knights to be kept to the end of
 the jousts. right so came out of the castle the fourth knight, and freshly
 proffered to joust with the knight with the red shield: and he was ready,
 and he smote him so hard that horse and man fell to the earth, and the
 knight's back brake with the fall, and his neck also. o jesu, said sir
 palomides, that yonder is a passing good knight, and the best jouster that
 ever i saw. by my head, said sir dinadan, he is as good as ever was sir
 launcelot or sir tristram, what knight somever he be.
 chapter xviii. how sir palomides would have jousted for sir lamorak with
 the knights of the castle.
 then forthwithal came a knight out of the castle, with a shield bended
 with black and with white. and anon the knight with the red shield and he
 encountered so hard that he smote the knight of the castle through the
 bended shield and through the body, and brake the horse's back. fair
 knight, said sir palomides, ye have overmuch on hand, therefore i pray you
 let me joust, for ye had need to be reposed. why sir, said the knight,
 seem ye that i am weak and feeble? and sir, methinketh ye proffer me
 wrong, and to me shame, when i do well enough. i tell you now as i told
 you erst; for an they were twenty knights i shall beat them, and if i be
 beaten or slain then may ye revenge me. and if ye think that i be weary,
 and ye have an appetite to joust with me, i shall find you jousting
 enough. sir, said palomides, i said it not because i would joust with you,
 but meseemeth that ye have overmuch on hand. and therefore, an ye were
 gentle, said the knight with the red shield, ye should not proffer me
 shame; therefore i require you to joust with me, and ye shall find that i
 am not weary. sith ye require me, said sir palomides, take keep to
 yourself. then they two knights came together as fast as their horses
 might run, and the knight smote sir palomides sore on the shield that the
 spear went into his side a great wound, and a perilous. and therewithal
 sir palomides avoided his saddle. and that knight turned unto sir dinadan;
 and when he saw him coming he cried aloud, and said: sir, i will not have
 ado with you; but for that he let it not, but came straight upon him. so
 sir dinadan for shame put forth his spear and all to-shivered it upon the
 knight. but he smote sir dinadan again so hard that he smote him clean
 from his saddle; but their horses he would not suffer his squires to
 meddle with, and because they were knights-errant.
 then he dressed him again to the castle, and jousted with seven knights
 more, and there was none of them might withstand him, but he bare him to
 the earth. and of these twelve knights he slew in plain jousts four. and
 the eight knights he made them to swear on the cross of a sword that they
 should never use the evil customs of the castle. and when he had made them
 to swear that oath he let them pass. and ever stood the lords and the
 ladies on the castle walls crying and saying: knight with the red shield,
 ye have marvellously well done as ever we saw knight do. and therewith
 came a knight out of the castle unarmed, and said: knight with the red
 shield, overmuch damage hast thou done to us this day, therefore return
 whither thou wilt, for here are no more will have ado with thee; for we
 repent sore that ever thou camest here, for by thee is fordone the old
 custom of this castle. and with that word he turned again into the castle,
 and shut the gates. then the knight with the red shield turned and called
 his squires, and so passed forth on his way, and rode a great pace.
 and when he was past sir palomides went to sir dinadan, and said: i had
 never such a shame of one knight that ever i met; and therefore i cast me
 to ride after him, and to be revenged with my sword, for a-horseback i
 deem i shall get no worship of him. sir palomides, said dinadan, ye shall
 not meddle with him by my counsel, for ye shall get no worship of him; and
 for this cause, ye have seen him this day have had overmuch to do, and
 overmuch travailed. by almighty jesu, said palomides, i shall never be at
 ease till that i have had ado with him. sir, said dinadan, i shall give
 you my beholding. well, said palomides, then shall ye see how we shall
 redress our mights. so they took their horses of their varlets, and rode
 after the knight with the red shield; and down in a valley beside a
 fountain they were ware where he was alighted to repose him, and had done
 off his helm for to drink at the well.
 chapter xix. how sir lamorak jousted with sir palomides, and hurt him
 grievously.
 then palomides rode fast till he came nigh him. and then he said: knight,
 remember ye of the shame ye did to me right now at the castle, therefore
 dress thee, for i will have ado with thee. fair knight, said he to
 palomides, of me ye win no worship, for ye have seen this day that i have
 been travailed sore. as for that, said palomides, i will not let, for wit
 ye well i will be revenged. well, said the knight, i may happen to endure
 you. and therewithal he mounted upon his horse, and took a great spear in
 his hand ready for to joust. nay, said palomides, i will not joust, for i
 am sure at jousting i get no prize. fair knight, said that knight, it
 would beseem a knight to joust and to fight on horseback. ye shall see
 what i will do, said palomides. and therewith he alighted down upon foot,
 and dressed his shield afore him and pulled out his sword. then the knight
 with the red shield descended down from his horse, and dressed his shield
 afore him, and so he drew out his sword. and then they came together a
 soft pace, and wonderly they lashed together passing thick the mountenance
 of an hour or ever they breathed. then they traced and traversed, and
 waxed wonderly wroth, and either behight other death; they hewed so fast
 with their swords that they cut in down half their swords and mails, that
 the bare flesh in some place stood above their harness. and when sir
 palomides beheld his fellow's sword over-hylled with his blood it grieved
 him sore: some while they foined, some while they struck as wild men. but
 at the last sir palomides waxed faint, because of his first wound that he
 had at the castle with a spear, for that wound grieved him wonderly sore.
 fair knight, said palomides, meseemeth we have assayed either other
 passing sore, and if it may please thee, i require thee of thy knighthood
 tell me thy name. sir, said the knight to palomides, that is me loath to
 do, for thou hast done me wrong and no knighthood to proffer me battle,
 considering my great travail, but an thou wilt tell me thy name i will
 tell thee mine. sir, said he, wit thou well my name is palomides. ah, sir,
 ye shall understand my name is sir lamorak de galis, son and heir unto the
 good knight and king, king pellinore, and sir tor, the good knight, is my
 half brother. when sir palomides heard him say so he kneeled down and
 asked mercy, for outrageously have i done to you this day; considering the
 great deeds of arms i have seen you do, shamefully and unknightly i have
 required you to do battle. ah, sir palomides, said sir lamorak, overmuch
 have ye done and said to me. and therewith he embraced him with his both
 hands, and said: palomides, the worthy knight, in all this land is no
 better than ye, nor more of prowess, and me repenteth sore that we should
 fight together. so it doth not me, said sir palomides, and yet am i sorer
 wounded than ye be; but as for that i shall soon thereof be whole. but
 certainly i would not for the fairest castle in this land, but if thou and
 i had met, for i shall love you the days of my life afore all other
 knights except my brother, sir safere. i say the same, said sir lamorak,
 except my brother, sir tor. then came sir dinadan, and he made great joy
 of sir lamorak. then their squires dressed both their shields and their
 harness, and stopped their wounds. and thereby at a priory they rested
 them all night.
 chapter xx. how it was told sir launcelot that dagonet chased king mark,
 and how a knight overthrew him and six knights.
 now turn we again. when sir ganis and sir brandiles with his fellows came
 to the court of king arthur they told the king, sir launcelot, and sir
 tristram, how sir dagonet, the fool, chased king mark through the forest,
 and how the strong knight smote them down all seven with one spear. there
 was great laughing and japing at king mark and at sir dagonet. but all
 these knights could not tell what knight it was that rescued king mark.
 then they asked king mark if that he knew him, and he answered and said:
 he named himself the knight that followed the questing beast, and on that
 name he sent one of my varlets to a place where was his mother; and when
 she heard from whence he came she made passing great dole, and discovered
 to my varlet his name, and said: oh, my dear son, sir palomides, why wilt
 thou not see me? and therefore, sir, said king mark, it is to understand
 his name is sir palomides, a noble knight. then were all these seven
 knights glad that they knew his name.
 now turn we again, for on the morn they took their horses, both sir
 lamorak, palomides, and dinadan, with their squires and varlets, till they
 saw a fair castle that stood on a mountain well closed, and thither they
 rode, and there they found a knight that hight galahalt, that was lord of
 that castle, and there they had great cheer and were well eased. sir
 dinadan, said sir lamorak, what will ye do? oh sir, said dinadan, i will
 to-morrow to the court of king arthur. by my head, said sir palomides, i
 will not ride these three days, for i am sore hurt, and much have i bled,
 and therefore i will repose me here. truly, said sir lamorak, and i will
 abide here with you; and when ye ride, then will i ride, unless that ye
 tarry over long; then will i take my horse. therefore i pray you, sir
 dinadan, abide and ride with us. faithfully, said dinadan, i will not
 abide, for i have such a talent to see sir tristram that i may not abide
 long from him. ah, dinadan, said sir palomides, now do i understand that
 ye love my mortal enemy, and therefore how should i trust you. well, said
 dinadan, i love my lord sir tristram, above all other, and him will i
 serve and do honour. so shall i, said sir lamorak, in all that may lie in
 my power.
 so on the morn sir dinadan rode unto the court of king arthur; and by the
 way as he rode he saw where stood an errant knight, and made him ready for
 to joust. not so, said dinadan, for i have no will to joust. with me shall
 ye joust, said the knight, or that ye pass this way. whether ask ye
 jousts, by love or by hate? the knight answered: wit ye well i ask it for
 love, and not for hate. it may well be so, said sir dinadan, but ye
 proffer me hard love when ye will joust with me with a sharp spear. but,
 fair knight, said sir dinadan, sith ye will joust with me, meet with me in
 the court of king arthur, and there shall i joust with you. well, said the
 knight, sith ye will not joust with me, i pray you tell me your name. sir
 knight, said he, my name is sir dinadan. ah, said the knight, full well
 know i you for a good knight and a gentle, and wit you well i love you
 heartily. then shall there be no jousts, said dinadan, betwixt us. so they
 departed. and the same day he came to camelot, where lay king arthur. and
 there he saluted the king and the queen, sir launcelot, and sir tristram;
 and all the court was glad of sir dinadan, for he was gentle, wise, and
 courteous, and a good knight. and in especial, the valiant knight sir
 tristram loved sir dinadan passing well above all other knights save sir
 launcelot.
 then the king asked sir dinadan what adventures he had seen. sir, said
 dinadan, i have seen many adventures, and of some king mark knoweth, but
 not all. then the king hearkened sir dinadan, how he told that sir
 palomides and he were afore the castle of morgan le fay, and how sir
 lamorak took the jousts afore them, and how he forjousted twelve knights,
 and of them four he slew, and how after he smote down sir palomides and me
 both. t i may not believe that, said the king, for sir palomides is a
 passing good knight. that is very truth, said sir dinadan, but yet i saw
 him better proved, hand for hand. and then he told the king all that
 battle, and how sir palomides was more weaker, and more hurt, and more
 lost of his blood. and without doubt, said sir dinadan, had the battle
 longer lasted, palomides had been slain. o jesu, said king arthur, this is
 to me a great marvel. sir, said tristram, marvel ye nothing thereof, for
 at mine advice there is not a valianter knight in the world living, for i
 know his might. and now i will say you, i was never so weary of knight but
 if it were sir launcelot. and there is no knight in the world except sir
 launcelot that did so well as sir lamorak. so god me help, said the king,
 i would that knight, sir lamorak, came to this court. sir, said dinadan,
 he will be here in short space, and sir palomides both, but i fear that
 palomides may not yet travel.
 chapter xxi. how king arthur let do cry a jousts, and how sir lamorak came
 in, and overthrew sir gawaine and many other.
 then within three days after the king let make a jousting at a priory. and
 there made them ready many knights of the round table, for sir gawaine and
 his brethren made them ready to joust; but tristram, launcelot, nor
 dinadan, would not joust, but suffered sir gawaine, for the love of king
 arthur, with his brethren, to win the gree if they might. then on the morn
 they apparelled them to joust, sir gawaine and his four brethren, and did
 there great deeds of arms. and sir ector de maris did marvellously well,
 but sir gawaine passed all that fellowship; wherefore king arthur and all
 the knights gave sir gawaine the honour at the beginning.
 right so king arthur was ware of a knight and two squires, the which came
 out of a forest side, with a shield covered with leather, and then he came
 slyly and hurtled here and there, and anon with one spear he had smitten
 down two knights of the round table. then with his hurtling he lost the
 covering of his shield, then was the king and all other ware that he bare
 a red shield. o jesu, said king arthur, see where rideth a stout knight,
 he with the red shield. and there was noise and crying beware the knight
 with the red shield. so within a little while he had overthrown three
 brethren of sir gawaine's. so god me help, said king arthur, meseemeth
 yonder is the best jouster that ever i saw. with that he saw him encounter
 with sir gawaine, and he smote him down with so great force that he made
 his horse to avoid his saddle. how now, said the king, sir gawaine hath a
 fall; well were me an i knew what knight he were with the red shield. i
 know him well, said dinadan, but as at this time ye shall not know his
 name. by my head, said sir tristram, he jousted better than sir palomides,
 and if ye list to know his name, wit ye well his name is sir lamorak de
 galis.
 as they stood thus talking, sir gawaine and he encountered together again,
 and there he smote sir gawaine from his horse, and bruised him sore. and
 in the sight of king arthur he smote down twenty knights, beside sir
 gawaine and his brethren. and so clearly was the prize given him as a
 knight peerless. then slyly and marvellously sir lamorak withdrew him from
 all the fellowship into the forest side. all this espied king arthur, for
 his eye went never from him. then the king, sir launcelot, sir tristram,
 and sir dinadan, took their hackneys, and rode straight after the good
 knight, sir lamorak de galis, and there found him. and thus said the king:
 ah, fair knight, well be ye found. when he saw the king he put off his
 helm and saluted him, and when he saw sir tristram he alighted down off
 his horse and ran to him to take him by the thighs, but sir tristram would
 not suffer him, but he alighted or that he came, and either took other in
 arms, and made great joy of other. the king was glad, and also was all the
 fellowship of the round table, except sir gawaine and his brethren. and
 when they wist that he was sir lamorak, they had great despite at him, and
 were wonderly wroth with him that he had put him to dishonour that day.
 then gawaine called privily in council all his brethren, and to them said
 thus: fair brethren, here may ye see, whom that we hate king arthur
 loveth, and whom that we love he hateth. and wit ye well, my fair
 brethren, that this sir lamorak will never love us, because we slew his
 father, king pellinore, for we deemed that he slew our father, king of
 orkney. and for the despite of pellinore, sir lamorak did us a shame to
 our mother, therefore i will be revenged. sir, said sir gawaine's
 brethren, let see how ye will or may be revenged, and ye shall find us
 ready. well, said gawaine, hold you still and we shall espy our time.
 chapter xxii. how king arthur made king mark to be accorded with sir
 tristram, and how they departed toward cornwall.
 now pass we our matter, and leave we sir gawaine, and speak of king
 arthur, that on a day said unto king mark: sir, i pray you give me a gift
 that i shall ask you. sir, said king mark, i will give you whatsomever ye
 desire an it be in my power. sir, gramercy, said arthur. this i will ask
 you, that ye will be good lord unto sir tristram, for he is a man of great
 honour; and that ye will take him with you into cornwall, and let him see
 his friends, and there cherish him for my sake. sir, said king mark, i
 promise you by the faith of my body, and by the faith that i owe to god
 and to you, i shall worship him for your sake in all that i can or may.
 sir, said arthur, and i will forgive you all the evil will that ever i
 ought you, an so be that you swear that upon a book before me. with a good
 will, said king mark; and so he there sware upon a book afore him and all
 his knights, and therewith king mark and sir tristram took either other by
 the hands hard knit together. but for all this king mark thought falsely,
 as it proved after, for he put sir tristram in prison, and cowardly would
 have slain him.
 then soon after king mark took his leave to ride into cornwall, and sir
 tristram made him ready to ride with him, whereof the most part of the
 round table were wroth and heavy, and in especial sir launcelot, and sir
 lamorak, and sir dinadan, were wroth out of measure for well they wist
 king mark would slay or destroy sir tristram. alas, said dinadan, that my
 lord, sir tristram, shall depart. and sir tristram took such sorrow that
 he was amazed like a fool. alas, said sir launcelot unto king arthur, what
 have ye done, for ye shall lose the most man of worship that ever came
 into your court. it was his own desire, said arthur, and therefore i might
 not do withal, for i have done all that i can and made them at accord.
 accord, said sir launcelot, fie upon that accord, for ye shall hear that
 he shall slay sir tristram, or put him in a prison, for he is the most
 coward and the villainest king and knight that is now living.
 and therewith sir launcelot departed, and came to king mark, and said to
 him thus: sir king, wit thou well the good knight sir tristram shall go
 with thee. beware, i rede thee, of treason, for an thou mischief that
 knight by any manner of falsehood or treason, by the faith i owe to god
 and to the order of knighthood, i shall slay thee with mine own hands. sir
 launcelot, said the king, overmuch have ye said to me, and i have sworn
 and said over largely afore king arthur in hearing of all his knights,
 that i shall not slay nor betray him. it were to me overmuch shame to
 break my promise. ye say well, said sir launcelot, but ye are called so
 false and full of treason that no man may believe you. forsooth it is
 known well wherefore ye came into this country, and for none other cause
 but for to slay sir tristram. so with great dole king mark and sir
 tristram rode together, for it was by sir tristram's will and his means to
 go with king mark, and all was for the intent to see la beale isoud, for
 without the sight of her sir tristram might not endure.
 chapter xxiii. how sir percivale was made knight of king arthur, and how a
 dumb maid spake, and brought him to the round table.
 now turn we again unto sir lamorak, and speak we of his brethren, sir tor,
 which was king pellinore's first son and begotten of aryes, wife of the
 cowherd, for he was a bastard; and sir aglovale was his first son begotten
 in wedlock; sir lamorak, dornar, percivale, these were his sons too in
 wedlock. so when king mark and sir tristram were departed from the court
 there was made great dole and sorrow for the departing of sir tristram.
 then the king and his knights made no manner of joys eight days after. and
 at the eight days' end there came to the court a knight with a young
 squire with him. and when this knight was unarmed, he went to the king and
 required him to make the young squire a knight. of what lineage is he
 come? said king arthur. sir, said the knight, he is the son of king
 pellinore, that did you some time good service, and he is a brother unto
 sir lamorak de galis, the good knight. well, said the king, for what cause
 desire ye that of me that i should make him knight? wit you well, my lord
 the king, that this young squire is brother to me as well as to sir
 lamorak, and my name is aglavale. sir aglavale, said arthur, for the love
 of sir lamorak, and for his father's love, he shall be made knight
 to-morrow. now tell me, said arthur, what is his name? sir, said the
 knight, his name is percivale de galis. so on the morn the king made him
 knight in camelot. but the king and all the knights thought it would be
 long or that he proved a good knight.
 then at the dinner, when the king was set at the table, and every knight
 after he was of prowess, the king commanded him to be set among mean
 knights; and so was sir percivale set as the king commanded. then was
 there a maiden in the queen's court that was come of high blood, and she
 was dumb and never spake word. right so she came straight into the hall,
 and went unto sir percivale, and took him by the hand and said aloud, that
 the king and all the knights might hear it: arise, sir percivale, the
 noble knight and god's knight, and go with me; and so he did. and there
 she brought him to the right side of the siege perilous, and said, fair
 knight, take here thy siege, for that siege appertaineth to thee and to
 none other. right so she departed and asked a priest. and as she was
 confessed and houselled then she died. then the king and all the court
 made great joy of sir percivale.
 chapter xxiv. how sir lamorak visited king lot's wife, and how sir gaheris
 slew her which was his own mother.
 now turn we unto sir lamorak, that much was there praised. then, by the
 mean of sir gawaine and his brethren, they sent for their mother there
 besides, fast by a castle beside camelot; and all was to that intent to
 slay sir lamorak. the queen of orkney was there but a while, but sir
 lamorak wist of their being, and was full fain; and for to make an end of
 this matter, he sent unto her, and there betwixt them was a night assigned
 that sir lamorak should come to her. thereof was ware sir gaheris, and
 there he rode afore the same night, and waited upon sir lamorak, and then
 he saw where he came all armed. and where sir lamorak alighted he tied his
 horse to a privy postern, and so he went into a parlour and unarmed him;
 and then he went unto the queen's bed, and she made of him passing great
 joy, and he of her again, for either loved other passing sore. so when the
 knight, sir gaheris, saw his time, he came to their bedside all armed,
 with his sword naked, and suddenly gat his mother by the hair and struck
 off her head.
 when sir lamorak saw the blood dash upon him all hot, the which he loved
 passing well, wit you well he was sore abashed and dismayed of that
 dolorous knight. and therewithal, sir lamorak leapt out of the bed in his
 shirt as a knight dismayed, saying thus: ah, sir gaheris, knight of the
 table round, foul and evil have ye done, and to you great shame. alas, why
 have ye slain your mother that bare you? with more right ye should have
 slain me. the offence hast thou done, said gaheris, notwithstanding a man
 is born to offer his service; but yet shouldst thou beware with whom thou
 meddlest, for thou hast put me and my brethren to a shame, and thy father
 slew our father; and thou to lie by our mother is too much shame for us to
 suffer. and as for thy father, king pellinore my brother sir gawaine and i
 slew him. ye did him the more wrong, said sir lamorak, for my father slew
 not your father, it was balin le savage: and as yet my father's death is
 not revenged. leave those words, said sir gaheris, for an thou speak
 feloniously i will slay thee. but because thou art naked i am ashamed to
 slay thee. but wit thou well, in what place i may get thee i shall slay
 thee; and now my mother is quit of thee; and withdraw thee and take thine
 armour, that thou were gone. sir lamorak saw there was none other bote,
 but fast armed him, and took his horse and rode his way making great
 sorrow. but for the shame and dolour he would not ride to king arthur's
 court, but rode another way.
 but when it was known that gaheris had slain his mother the king was
 passing wroth, and commanded him to go out of his court. wit ye well sir
 gawaine was wroth that gaheris had slain his mother and let sir lamorak
 escape. and for this matter was the king passing wroth, and so was sir
 launcelot, and many other knights. sir, said sir launcelot, here is a
 great mischief befallen by felony, and by forecast treason, that your
 sister is thus shamefully slain. and i dare say that it was wrought by
 treason, and i dare say ye shall lose that good knight, sir lamorak the
 which is great pity. i wot well and am sure, an sir tristram wist it, he
 would never more come within your court, the which should grieve you much
 more and all your knights. god defend, said the noble king arthur, that i
 should lose sir lamorak or sir tristram, for then twain of my chief
 knights of the table round were gone. sir, said sir launcelot, i am sure
 ye shall lose sir lamorak, for sir gawaine and his brethren will slay him
 by one mean or other; for they among them have concluded and sworn to slay
 him an ever they may see their time. that shall i let, said arthur.
 chapter xxv. how sir agravaine and sir mordred met with a knight fleeing,
 and how they both were overthrown, and of sir dinadan.
 now leave we of sir lamorak, and speak of sir gawaine's brethren, and
 specially of sir agravaine and sir mordred. as they rode on their
 adventures they met with a knight fleeing, sore wounded; and they asked
 him what tidings. fair knights, said he, here cometh a knight after me
 that will slay me. with that came sir dinadan riding to them by adventure,
 but he would promise them no help. but sir agravaine and sir mordred
 promised him to rescue him. therewithal came that knight straight unto
 them, and anon he proffered to joust. that saw sir mordred and rode to
 him, but he struck mordred over his horse's tail. that saw sir agravaine,
 and straight he rode toward that knight, and right so as he served mordred
 so he served agravaine, and said to them: sirs, wit ye well both that i am
 breuse saunce pité, that hath done this to you. and yet he rode over
 agravaine five or six times. when dinadan saw this, he must needs joust
 with him for shame. and so dinadan and he encountered together, that with
 pure strength sir dinadan smote him over his horse's tail then he took his
 horse and fled, for he was on foot one of the valiantest knights in
 arthur's days, and a great destroyer of all good knights.
 then rode sir dinadan unto sir mordred and unto sir agravaine. sir knight,
 said they all, well have ye done, and well have ye revenged us, wherefore
 we pray you tell us your name. fair sirs, ye ought to know my name, the
 which is called sir dinadan. when they understood that it was dinadan they
 were more wroth than they were before, for they hated him out of measure
 because of sir lamorak. for dinadan had such a custom that he loved all
 good knights that were valiant, and he hated all those that were
 destroyers of good knights. and there were none that hated dinadan but
 those that ever were called murderers. then spake the hurt knight that
 breuse saunce pité had chased, his name was dalan, and said: if thou be
 dinadan thou slewest my father. it may well be so, said dinadan, but then
 it was in my defence and at his request. by my head, said dalan, thou
 shalt die therefore, and therewith he dressed his spear and his shield.
 and to make the shorter tale, sir dinadan smote him down off his horse,
 that his neck was nigh broken. and in the same wise he smote sir mordred
 and sir agravaine. and after, in the quest of the sangreal, cowardly and
 feloniously they slew dinadan, the which was great damage, for he was a
 great bourder and a passing good knight.
 and so sir dinadan rode to a castle that hight beale-valet. and there he
 found sir palomides that was not yet whole of the wound that sir lamorak
 gave him. and there dinadan told palomides all the tidings that he heard
 and saw of sir tristram, and how he was gone with king mark, and with him
 he hath all his will and desire. therewith sir palomides waxed wroth, for
 he loved la beale isoud. and then he wist well that sir tristram enjoyed
 her.
 chapter xxvi. how king arthur, the queen, and launcelot received letters
 out of cornwall, and of the answer again.
 now leave we sir palomides and sir dinadan in the castle of beale-valet,
 and turn we again unto king arthur. there came a knight out of cornwall,
 his name was fergus, a fellow of the round table. and there he told the
 king and sir launcelot good tidings of sir tristram, and there were
 brought goodly letters, and how he left him in the castle of tintagil.
 then came the damosel that brought goodly letters unto king arthur and
 unto sir launcelot, and there she had passing good cheer of the king, and
 of the queen guenever, and of sir launcelot. then they wrote goodly
 letters again. but sir launcelot bade ever sir tristram beware of king
 mark, for ever he called him in his letters king fox, as who saith, he
 fareth all with wiles and treason. whereof sir tristram in his heart
 thanked sir launcelot. then the damosel went unto la beale isoud, and bare
 her letters from the king and from sir launcelot, whereof she was in
 passing great joy. fair damosel, said la beale isoud, how fareth my lord
 arthur, and the queen guenever, and the noble knight, sir launcelot? she
 answered, and to make short tale: much the better that ye and sir tristram
 be in joy. god reward them, said la beale isoud, for sir tristram
 suffereth great pain for me, and i for him.
 so the damosel departed, and brought letters to king mark. and when he had
 read them, and understood them, he was wroth with sir tristram, for he
 deemed that he had sent the damosel unto king arthur. for arthur and
 launcelot in a manner threated king mark. and as king mark read these
 letters he deemed treason by sir tristram. damosel, said king mark, will
 ye ride again and bear letters from me unto king arthur? sir, she said, i
 will be at your commandment to ride when ye will. ye say well, said the
 king; come again, said the king, to-morn, and fetch your letters. then she
 departed and told them how she should ride again with letters unto arthur.
 then we pray you, said la beale isoud and sir tristram, that when ye have
 received your letters, that ye would come by us that we may see the
 privity of your letters. all that i may do, madam, ye wot well i must do
 for sir tristram, for i have been long his own maiden.
 so on the morn the damosel went to king mark to have had his letters and
 to depart. i am not avised, said king mark, as at this time to send my
 letters. then privily and secretly he sent letters unto king arthur, and
 unto queen guenever, and unto sir launcelot. so the varlet departed, and
 found the king and the queen in wales, at carlion. and as the king and the
 queen were at mass the varlet came with the letters. and when mass was
 done the king and the queen opened the letters privily by themself. and
 the beginning of the king's letters spake wonderly short unto king arthur,
 and bade him entermete with himself and with his wife, and of his knights;
 for he was able enough to rule and keep his wife.
 chapter xxvii. how sir launcelot was wroth with the letter that he
 received from king mark, and of dinadan which made a lay of king mark.
 when king arthur understood the letter, he mused of many things, and
 thought on his sister's words, queen morgan le fay, that she had said
 betwixt queen guenever and sir launcelot. and in this thought he studied a
 great while. then he bethought him again how his sister was his own enemy,
 and that she hated the queen and sir launcelot, and so he put all that out
 of his thought. then king arthur read the letter again, and the latter
 clause said that king mark took sir tristram for his mortal enemy;
 wherefore he put arthur out of doubt he would be revenged of sir tristram.
 then was king arthur wroth with king mark. and when queen guenever read
 her letter and understood it, she was wroth out of measure, for the letter
 spake shame by her and by sir launcelot. and so privily she sent the
 letter unto sir launcelot. and when he wist the intent of the letter he
 was so wroth that he laid him down on his bed to sleep, whereof sir
 dinadan was ware, for it was his manner to be privy with all good knights.
 and as sir launcelot slept he stole the letter out of his hand, and read
 it word by word. and then he made great sorrow for anger. and so sir
 launcelot awaked, and went to a window, and read the letter again, the
 which made him angry.
 sir, said dinadan, wherefore be ye angry? discover your heart to me:
 forsooth ye wot well i owe you good will, howbeit i am a poor knight and a
 servitor unto you and to all good knights. for though i be not of worship
 myself i love all those that be of worship. it is truth, said sir
 launcelot, ye are a trusty knight, and for great trust i will shew you my
 counsel. and when dinadan understood all, he said: this is my counsel: set
 you right nought by these threats, for king mark is so villainous, that by
 fair speech shall never man get of him. but ye shall see what i shall do;
 i will make a lay for him, and when it is made i shall make an harper to
 sing it afore him. so anon he went and made it, and taught it an harper
 that hight eliot. and when he could it, he taught it to many harpers. and
 so by the will of sir launcelot, and of arthur, the harpers went straight
 into wales, and into cornwall, to sing the lay that sir dinadan made by
 king mark, the which was the worst lay that ever harper sang with harp or
 with any other instruments.
 chapter xxviii. how sir tristram was hurt, and of a war made to king mark;
 and of sir tristram how he promised to rescue him.
 now turn we again unto sir tristram and to king mark. as sir tristram was
 at jousts and at tournament it fortuned he was sore hurt both with a spear
 and with a sword, but yet he won always the degree. and for to repose him
 he went to a good knight that dwelled in cornwall, in a castle, whose name
 was sir dinas le seneschal. then by misfortune there came out of sessoin a
 great number of men of arms, and an hideous host, and they entered nigh
 the castle of tintagil; and their captain's name was elias, a good man of
 arms. when king mark understood his enemies were entered into his land he
 made great dole and sorrow, for in no wise by his will king mark would not
 send for sir tristram, for he hated him deadly.
 so when his council was come they devised and cast many perils of the
 strength of their enemies. and then they concluded all at once, and said
 thus unto king mark: sir, wit ye well ye must send for sir tristram, the
 good knight, or else they will never be overcome. for by sir tristram they
 must be foughten withal, or else we row against the stream. well, said
 king mark, i will do by your counsel; but yet he was full loath thereto,
 but need constrained him to send for him. then was he sent for in all
 haste that might be, that he should come to king mark. and when he
 understood that king mark had sent for him, he mounted upon a soft ambler
 and rode to king mark. and when he was come the king said thus: fair
 nephew sir tristram, this is all. here be come our enemies of sessoin,
 that are here nigh hand, and without tarrying they must be met with
 shortly, or else they will destroy this country. sir, said sir tristram,
 wit ye well all my power is at your commandment. and wit ye well, sir,
 these eight days i may bear none arms, for my wounds be not yet whole. and
 by that day i shall do what i may. ye say well, said king mark; then go ye
 again and repose you and make you fresh, and i shall go and meet the
 sessoins with all my power.
 so the king departed unto tintagil, and sir tristram went to repose him.
 and the king made a great host and departed them in three; the first part
 led sir dinas the seneschal, and sir andred led the second part, and sir
 argius led the third part; and he was of the blood of king mark. and the
 sessoins had three great battles, and many good men of arms. and so king
 mark by the advice of his knights issued out of the castle of tintagil
 upon his enemies. and dinas, the good knight, rode out afore, and slew two
 knights with his own hands, and then began the battles. and there was
 marvellous breaking of spears and smiting of swords, and slew down many
 good knights. and ever was sir dinas the seneschal the best of king mark's
 party. and thus the battle endured long with great mortality. but at the
 last king mark and sir dinas, were they never so loath, they withdrew them
 to the castle of tintagil with great slaughter of people; and the sessoins
 followed on fast, that ten of them were put within the gates and four
 slain with the portcullis.
 then king mark sent for sir tristram by a varlet, that told him all the
 mortality. then he sent the varlet again, and bade him: tell king mark
 that i will come as soon as i am whole, for erst i may do him no good.
 then king mark had his answer. therewith came elias and bade the king
 yield up the castle: for ye may not hold it no while. sir elias, said the
 king, so will i yield up the castle if i be not soon rescued. anon king
 mark sent again for rescue to sir tristram. by then sir tristram was
 whole, and he had gotten him ten good knights of arthur's; and with them
 he rode unto tintagil. and when he saw the great host of sessoins he
 marvelled wonder greatly. and then sir tristram rode by the woods and by
 the ditches as secretly as he might, till he came nigh the gates. and
 there dressed a knight to him when he saw that sir tristram would enter;
 and sir tristram smote him down dead, and so he served three more. and
 everych of these ten knights slew a man of arms. so sir tristram entered
 into the castle of tintagil. and when king mark wist that sir tristram was
 come he was glad of his coming, and so was all the fellowship, and of him
 they made great joy.
 chapter xxix. how sir tristram overcame the battle, and how elias desired
 a man to fight body for body.
 so on the morn elias the captain came, and bade king mark: come out and do
 battle; for now the good knight sir tristram is entered it will be shame
 to thee, said elias, for to keep thy walls. when king mark understood this
 he was wroth and said no word, but went unto sir tristram and asked him
 his counsel. sir, said sir tristram, will ye that i give him his answer? i
 will well, said king mark. then sir tristram said thus to the messenger:
 bear thy lord word from the king and me, that we will do battle with him
 to-morn in the plain field. what is your name? said the messenger. wit
 thou well my name is sir tristram de liones. therewithal the messenger
 departed and told his lord elias all that he had heard. sir, said sir
 tristram unto king mark, i pray you give me leave to have the rule of the
 battle. i pray you take the rule, said king mark. then sir tristram let
 devise the battle in what manner that it should be. he let depart his host
 in six parties, and ordained sir dinas the seneschal to have the foreward,
 and other knights to rule the remnant. and the same night sir tristram
 burnt all the sessoins' ships unto the cold water. anon, as elias wist
 that, he said it was of sir tristram's doing: for he casteth that we shall
 never escape, mother son of us. therefore, fair fellows, fight freely
 to-morrow, and miscomfort you nought; for any knight, though he be the
 best knight in the world, he may not have ado with us all.
 then they ordained their battle in four parties, wonderly well apparelled
 and garnished with men of arms. thus they within issued, and they without
 set freely upon them; and there sir dinas did great deeds of arms. not for
 then sir dinas and his fellowship were put to the worse. with that came
 sir tristram and slew two knights with one spear; then he slew on the
 right hand and on the left hand, that men marvelled that ever he might do
 such deeds of arms. and then he might see sometime the battle was driven a
 bow-draught from the castle, and sometime it was at the gates of the
 castle. then came elias the captain rushing here and there, and hit king
 mark so sore upon the helm that he made him to avoid the saddle. and then
 sir dinas gat king mark again to horseback. therewithal came in sir
 tristram like a lion, and there he met with elias, and he smote him so
 sore upon the helm that he avoided his saddle. and thus they fought till
 it was night, and for great slaughter and for wounded people everych party
 drew to their rest.
 and when king mark was come within the castle of tintagil he lacked of his
 knights an hundred, and they without lacked two hundred; and they searched
 the wounded men on both parties. and then they went to council; and wit
 you well either party were loath to fight more, so that either might
 escape with their worship. when elias the captain understood the death of
 his men he made great dole; and when he wist that they were loath to go to
 battle again he was wroth out of measure. then elias sent word unto king
 mark, in great despite, whether he would find a knight that would fight
 for him body for body. and if that he might slay king mark's knight, he to
 have the truage of cornwall yearly. and if that his knight slay mine, i
 fully release my claim forever. then the messenger departed unto king
 mark, and told him how that his lord elias had sent him word to find a
 knight to do battle with him body for body. when king mark understood the
 messenger, he bade him abide and he should have his answer. then called he
 all the baronage together to wit what was the best counsel. they said all
 at once: to fight in a field we have no lust, for had not been sir
 tristram's prowess it had been likely that we never should have escaped;
 and therefore, sir, as we deem, it were well done to find a knight that
 would do battle with him, for he knightly proffereth.
 chapter xxi. how sir elias and sir tristram fought together for the
 truage, and how sir tristram slew elias in the field.
 not for then when all this was said, they could find no knight that would
 do battle with him. sir king, said they all, here is no knight that dare
 fight with elias. alas, said king mark, then am i utterly ashamed and
 utterly destroyed, unless that my nephew sir tristram will take the battle
 upon him. wit you well, they said all, he had yesterday overmuch on hand,
 and he is weary for travail, and sore wounded. where is he? said king
 mark. sir, said they, he is in his bed to repose him. alas, said king
 mark, but i have the succour of my nephew sir tristram, i am utterly
 destroyed for ever.
 therewith one went to sir tristram where he lay, and told him what king
 mark had said. and therewith sir tristram arose lightly, and put on him a
 long gown, and came afore the king and all the lords. and when he saw them
 all so dismayed he asked the king and the lords what tidings were with
 them. never worse, said the king. and therewith he told him all, how he
 had word of elias to find a knight to fight for the truage of cornwall,
 and none can i find. and as for you, said the king and all the lords, we
 may ask no more of you for shame; for through your hardiness yesterday ye
 saved all our lives. sir, said sir tristram, now i understand ye would
 have my succour, reason would that i should do all that lieth in my power
 to do, saving my worship and my life, howbeit i am sore bruised and hurt.
 and sithen sir elias proffereth so largely, i shall fight with him, or
 else i will be slain in the field, or else i will deliver cornwall from
 the old truage. and therefore lightly call his messenger and he shall be
 answered, for as yet my wounds be green, and they will be sorer a seven
 night after than they be now; and therefore he shall have his answer that
 i will do battle to-morn with him.
 then was the messenger departed brought before king mark. hark, my fellow,
 said sir tristram, go fast unto thy lord, and bid him make true assurance
 on his part for the truage, as the king here shall make on his part; and
 then tell thy lord, sir elias, that i, sir tristram, king arthur's knight,
 and knight of the table round, will as to-morn meet with thy lord on
 horseback, to do battle as long as my horse may endure, and after that to
 do battle with him on foot to the utterance. the messenger beheld sir
 tristram from the top to the toe; and therewithal he departed and came to
 his lord, and told him how he was answered of sir tristram. and
 therewithal was made hostage on both parties, and made it as sure as it
 might be, that whether party had the victory, so to end. and then were
 both hosts assembled on both parts of the field, without the castle of
 tintagil, and there was none but sir tristram and sir elias armed.
 so when the appointment was made, they departed in-sunder, and they came
 together with all the might that their horses might run. and either knight
 smote other so hard that both horses and knights went to the earth. not
 for then they both lightly arose and dressed their shields on their
 shoulders, with naked swords in their hands, and they dashed together that
 it seemed a flaming fire about them. thus they traced, and traversed, and
 hewed on helms and hauberks, and cut away many cantels of their shields,
 and either wounded other passing sore, so that the hot blood fell freshly
 upon the earth. and by then they had foughten the mountenance of an hour
 sir tristram waxed faint and for-bled, and gave sore aback. that saw sir
 elias, and followed fiercely upon him, and wounded him in many places. and
 ever sir tristram traced and traversed, and went froward him here and
 there, and covered him with his shield as he might all weakly, that all
 men said he was overcome; for sir elias had given him twenty strokes
 against one.
 then was there laughing of the sessoins' party, and great dole on king
 mark's party. alas, said the king, we are ashamed and destroyed all for
 ever: for as the book saith, sir tristram was never so matched, but if it
 were sir launcelot. thus as they stood and beheld both parties, that one
 party laughing and the other party weeping, sir tristram remembered him of
 his lady, la beale isoud, that looked upon him, and how he was likely
 never to come in her presence. then he pulled up his shield that erst hung
 full low. and then he dressed up his shield unto elias, and gave him many
 sad strokes, twenty against one, and all to-brake his shield and his
 hauberk, that the hot blood ran down to the earth. then began king mark to
 laugh, and all cornish men, and that other party to weep. and ever sir
 tristram said to sir elias: yield thee.
 then when sir tristram saw him so staggering on the ground, he said: sir
 elias, i am right sorry for thee, for thou art a passing good knight as
 ever i met withal, except sir launcelot. therewithal sir elias fell to the
 earth, and there died. what shall i do, said sir tristram unto king mark,
 for this battle is at an end? then they of elias' party departed, and king
 mark took of them many prisoners, to redress the harms and the scathes
 that he had of them; and the remnant he sent into their country to borrow
 out their fellows. then was sir tristram searched and well healed. yet for
 all this king mark would fain have slain sir tristram. but for all that
 ever sir tristram saw or heard by king mark, yet would he never beware of
 his treason, but ever he would be thereas la beale isoud was.
 chapter xxxi. how at a great feast that king mark made an harper came and
 sang the lay that dinadan had made.
 now will we pass of this matter, and speak we of the harpers that sir
 launcelot and sir dinadan had sent into cornwall. and at the great feast
 that king mark made for joy that the sessoins were put out of his country,
 then came eliot the harper with the lay that dinadan had made and secretly
 brought it unto sir tristram, and told him the lay that dinadan had made
 by king mark. and when sir tristram heard it, he said: o lord jesu, that
 dinadan can make wonderly well and ill, thereas it shall be. sir, said
 eliot, dare i sing this song afore king mark? yea, on my peril, said sir
 tristram, for i shall be thy warrant. then at the meat came in eliot the
 harper, and because he was a curious harper men heard him sing the same
 lay that dinadan had made, the which spake the most villainy by king mark
 of his treason that ever man heard.
 when the harper had sung his song to the end king mark was wonderly wroth,
 and said: thou harper, how durst thou be so bold on thy head to sing this
 song afore me. sir, said eliot, wit you well i am a minstrel, and i must
 do as i am commanded of these lords that i bear the arms of. and sir, wit
 ye well that sir dinadan, a knight of the table round, made this song, and
 made me to sing it afore you. thou sayest well, said king mark, and
 because thou art a minstrel thou shalt go quit, but i charge thee hie thee
 fast out of my sight. so the harper departed and went to sir tristram, and
 told him how he had sped. then sir tristram let make letters as goodly as
 he could to launcelot and to sir dinadan. and so he let conduct the harper
 out of the country. but to say that king mark was wonderly wroth, he was,
 for he deemed that the lay that was sung afore him was made by sir
 tristram's counsel, wherefore he thought to slay him and all his
 well-willers in that country.
 chapter xxxii. how king mark slew by treason his brother boudwin, for good
 service that he had done to him.
 now turn we to another matter that fell between king mark and his brother,
 that was called the good prince boudwin, that all the people of the
 country loved passing well. so it befell on a time that the miscreant
 saracens landed in the country of cornwall soon after these sessoins were
 gone. and then the good prince boudwin, at the landing, he raised the
 country privily and hastily. and or it were day he let put wildfire in
 three of his own ships, and suddenly he pulled up the sail, and with the
 wind he made those ships to be driven among the navy of the saracens. and
 to make short tale, those three ships set on fire all the ships, that none
 were saved. and at point of the day the good prince boudwin with all his
 fellowship set on the miscreants with shouts and cries, and slew to the
 number of forty thousand, and left none alive.
 when king mark wist this he was wonderly wroth that his brother should win
 such worship. and because this prince was better beloved than he in all
 that country, and that also boudwin loved well sir tristram, therefore he
 thought to slay him. and thus, hastily, as a man out of his wit, he sent
 for prince boudwin and anglides his wife, and bade them bring their young
 son with them, that he might see him. all this he did to the intent to
 slay the child as well as his father, for he was the falsest traitor that
 ever was born. alas, for his goodness and for his good deeds this gentle
 prince boudwin was slain. so when he came with his wife anglides, the king
 made them fair semblant till they had dined. and when they had dined king
 mark sent for his brother and said thus: brother, how sped you when the
 miscreants arrived by you? meseemeth it had been your part to have sent me
 word, that i might have been at that journey, for it had been reason that
 i had had the honour and not you. sir, said the prince boudwin, it was so
 that an i had tarried till that i had sent for you those miscreants had
 destroyed my country. thou liest, false traitor, said king mark, for thou
 art ever about for to win worship from me, and put me to dishonour, and
 thou cherishest that i hate. and therewith he struck him to the heart with
 a dagger, that he never after spake word. then the lady anglides made
 great dole, and swooned, for she saw her lord slain afore her face. then
 was there no more to do but prince boudwin was despoiled and brought to
 burial. but anglides privily gat her husband's doublet and his shirt, and
 that she kept secretly.
 then was there much sorrow and crying, and great dole made sir tristram,
 sir dinas, sir fergus, and so did all knights that were there; for that
 prince was passingly well beloved. so la beale isoud sent unto anglides,
 the prince boudwin's wife, and bade her avoid lightly or else her young
 son, alisander le orphelin, should be slain when she heard this, she took
 her horse and her child; and rode with such poor men as durst ride with
 her.
 chapter xxxiii. how anglides, boudwin's wife, escaped with her young son,
 alisander le orphelin, and came to the castle of arundel.
 notwithstanding, when king mark had done this deed, yet he thought to do
 more vengeance; and with his sword in his hand, he sought from chamber to
 chamber, to seek anglides and her young son. and when she was missed he
 called a good knight that hight sadok, and charged him by pain of death to
 fetch anglides again and her young son. so sir sadok departed and rode
 after anglides. and within ten mile he overtook her, and bade her turn
 again and ride with him to king mark. alas, fair knight, she said, what
 shall ye win by my son's death or by mine? i have had overmuch harm and
 too great a loss. madam, said sadok, of your loss is dole and pity; but
 madam, said sadok, would ye depart out of this country with your son, and
 keep him till he be of age, that he may revenge his father's death, then
 would i suffer you to depart from me, so you promise me to revenge the
 death of prince boudwin. ah, gentle knight, jesu thank thee, and if ever
 my son, alisander le orphelin, live to be a knight, he shall have his
 father's doublet and his shirt with the bloody marks, and i shall give him
 such a charge that he shall remember it while he liveth. and therewithal
 sadok departed from her, and either betook other to god. and when sadok
 came to king mark he told him faithfully that he had drowned young
 alisander her son; and thereof king mark was full glad.
 now turn we unto anglides, that rode both night and day by adventure out
 of cornwall, and little and in few places she rested; but ever she drew
 southward to the seaside, till by fortune she came to a castle that is
 called magouns, and now it is called arundel, in sussex. and the constable
 of the castle welcomed her, and said she was welcome to her own castle;
 and there was anglides t worshipfully received, for the constable's wife
 was nigh her cousin, and the constable's name was bellangere; and that
 same constable told anglides that the same castle was hers by right
 inheritance. thus anglides endured years and winters, till alisander was
 big and strong; there was none so wight in all that country, neither there
 was none that might do no manner of mastery afore him.
 chapter xxxiv. how anglides gave the bloody doublet to alisander, her son,
 the same day that he was made knight, and the charge withal.
 then upon a day bellangere the constable came to anglides and said: madam,
 it were time my lord alisander were made knight, for he is a passing
 strong young man. sir, said she, i would he were made knight; but then
 must i give him the most charge that ever sinful mother gave to her child.
 do as ye list, said bellangere, and i shall give him warning that he shall
 be made knight. now it will be well done that he may be made knight at our
 lady day in lent. be it so, said anglides, and i pray you make ready
 therefore. so came the constable to alisander, and told him that he should
 at our lady day in lent be made knight. i thank god, said alisander; these
 are the best tidings that ever came to me. then the constable ordained
 twenty of the greatest gentlemen's sons, and the best born men of the
 country, that should be made knights that same day that alisander was made
 knight. so on the same day that alisander and his twenty fellows were made
 knights, at the offering of the mass there came anglides unto her son and
 said thus: o fair sweet son, i charge thee upon my blessing, and of the
 high order of chivalry that thou takest here this day, that thou
 understand what i shall say and charge thee withal. therewithal she pulled
 out a bloody doublet and a bloody shirt, that were be-bled with old blood.
 when alisander saw this he stert aback and waxed pale, and said: fair
 mother, what may this mean? i shall tell thee, fair son: this was thine
 own father's doublet and shirt, that he wore upon him that same day that
 he was slain. and there she told him why and wherefore, and how for his
 goodness king mark slew him with his dagger afore mine own eyen. and
 therefore this shall be your charge that i shall give thee.
 chapter xxxv. how it was told to king mark of sir alisander, and how he
 would have slain sir sadok for saving his life.
 now i require thee, and charge thee upon my blessing, and upon the high
 order of knighthood, that thou be revenged upon king mark for the death of
 thy father. and therewithal she swooned. then alisander leapt to his
 mother, and took her up in his arms, and said: fair mother, ye have given
 me a great charge, and here i promise you i shall be avenged upon king
 mark when that i may; and that i promise to god and to you. so this feast
 was ended, and the constable, by the advice of anglides, let purvey that
 alisander was well horsed and harnessed. then he jousted with his twenty
 fellows that were made knights with him, but for to make a short tale, he
 overthrew all those twenty, that none might withstand him a buffet.
 then one of those knights departed unto king mark, and told him all, how
 alisander was made knight, and all the charge that his mother gave him, as
 ye have heard afore time. alas, false treason, said king mark, i weened
 that young traitor had been dead. alas, whom may i trust? and therewithal
 king mark took a sword in his hand; and sought sir sadok from chamber to
 chamber to slay him. when sir sadok saw king mark come with his sword in
 his hand he said thus: beware, king mark, and come not nigh me; for wit
 thou well that i saved alisander his life, of which i never repent me, for
 thou falsely and cowardly slew his father boudwin, traitorly for his good
 deeds; wherefore i pray almighty jesu send alisander might and strength to
 be revenged upon thee. and now beware king mark of young alisander, for he
 is made a knight. alas, said king mark, that ever i should hear a traitor
 say so afore me. and therewith four knights of king mark's drew their
 swords to slay sir sadok, but anon sir sadok slew them all in king mark's
 presence. and then sir sadok passed forth into his chamber, and took his
 horse and his harness, and rode on his way a good pace. for there was
 neither sir tristram, neither sir dinas, nor sir fergus, that would sir
 sadok any evil will. then was king mark wroth, and thought to destroy sir
 alisander and sir sadok that had saved him; for king mark dreaded and
 hated alisander most of any man living.
 when sir tristram understood that alisander was made knight, anon
 forthwithal he sent him a letter, praying him and charging him that he
 would draw him to the court of king arthur, and that he put him in the
 rule and in the hands of sir launcelot. so this letter was sent to
 alisander from his cousin, sir tristram. and at that time he thought to do
 after his commandment. then king mark called a knight that brought him the
 tidings from alisander, and bade him abide still in that country. sir,
 said that knight, so must i do, for in my own country i dare not come. no
 force, said king mark, i shall give thee here double as much lands as ever
 thou hadst of thine own. but within short space sir sadok met with that
 false knight, and slew him. then was king mark wood wroth out of measure.
 then he sent unto queen morgan le fay, and to the queen of north-galis,
 praying them in his letters that they two sorceresses would set all the
 country in fire with ladies that were enchantresses, and by such that were
 dangerous knights, as malgrin, breuse saunce pité, that by no mean
 alisander le orphelin should escape, but either he should be taken or
 slain. this ordinance made king mark for to destroy alisander.
 chapter xxxvi. how sir alisander won the prize at a tournament, and of
 morgan le fay: and how he fought with sir malgrin, and slew him.
 now turn we again unto sir alisander, that at his departing his mother
 took with him his father's bloody shirt. so that he bare with him always
 till his death day, in tokening to think of his father's death. so was
 alisander purposed to ride to london, by the counsel of sir tristram, to
 sir launcelot. and by fortune he went by the seaside, and rode wrong. and
 there he won at a tournament the gree that king carados made. and there he
 smote down king carados and twenty of his knights, and also sir safere, a
 good knight that was sir palomides' brother, the good knight. all this saw
 a damosel, and saw the best knight joust that ever she saw. and ever as he
 smote down knights he made them to swear to wear none harness in a
 twelvemonth and a day. this is well said, said morgan le fay, this is the
 knight that i would fain see. and so she took her palfrey, and rode a
 great while, and then she rested her in her pavilion. so there came four
 knights, two were armed, and two were unarmed, and they told morgan le fay
 their names: the first was elias de gomeret, the second was cari de
 gomeret, those were armed; that other twain were of camiliard, cousins
 unto queen guenever, and that one hight guy, and that other hight garaunt,
 those were unarmed. there these four knights told morgan le fay how a
 young knight had smitten them down before a castle for the maiden of that
 castle said that he was but late made knight, and young. but as we
 suppose, but if it were sir tristram, or sir launcelot, or sir lamorak,
 the good knight, there is none that might sit him a buffet with a spear.
 well, said morgan le fay, i shall meet that knight or it be long time, an
 he dwell in that country.
 so turn we to the damosel of the castle, that when alisander le orphelin
 had forjousted the four knights, she called him to her, and said thus: sir
 knight, wilt thou for my sake joust and fight with a knight, for my sake,
 of this country, that is and hath been long time an evil neighbour to me?
 his name is malgrin, and he will not suffer me to be married in no manner
 wise for all that i can do, or any knight for my sake. damosel, said
 alisander, an he come whiles i am here i will fight with him, and my poor
 body for your sake i will jeopard. and therewithal she sent for him, for
 he was at her commandment. and when either had a sight of other, they made
 them ready for to joust, and they came together eagerly, and malgrin
 brised his spear upon alisander, and alisander smote him again so hard
 that he bare him quite from his saddle to the earth. but this malgrin
 arose lightly, and dressed his shield and drew his sword, and bade him
 alight, saying: though thou have the better of me on horseback, thou shalt
 find that i shall endure like a knight on foot. it is well said, said
 alisander; and so lightly he avoided his horse and betook him to his
 varlet. and then they rushed together like two boars, and laid on their
 helms and shields long time, by the space of three hours, that never man
 could say which was the better knight.
 and in the meanwhile came morgan le fay to the damosel of the castle, and
 they beheld the battle. but this malgrin was an old roted knight, and he
 was called one of the dangerous knights of the world to do battle on foot,
 but on horseback there were many better. and ever this malgrin awaited to
 slay alisander, and so wounded him wonderly sore, that it was marvel that
 ever he might stand, for he had bled so much blood; for alisander fought
 wildly, and not wittily. and that other was a felonious knight, and
 awaited him, and smote him sore. and sometime they rushed together with
 their shields, like two boars or rams, and fell grovelling both to the
 earth. now knight, said malgrin, hold thy hand a while, and tell me what
 thou art. i will not, said alisander, but if me list: but tell me thy
 name, and why thou keepest this country, or else thou shalt die of my
 hands. wit thou well, said malgrin, that for this maiden's love, of this
 castle, i have slain ten good knights by mishap; and by outrage and
 orgulité of myself i have slain ten other knights. so god me help, said
 alisander, this is the foulest confession that ever i heard knight make,
 nor never heard i speak of other men of such a shameful confession;
 wherefore it were great pity and great shame unto me that i should let
 thee live any longer; therefore keep thee as well as ever thou mayest, for
 as i am true knight, either thou shalt slay me or else i shall slay thee,
 i promise thee faithfully.
 then they lashed together fiercely, and at the last alisander smote
 malgrin to the earth. and then he raced off his helm, and smote off his
 head lightly. and when he had done and ended this battle, anon he called
 to him his varlet, the which brought him his horse. and then he, weening
 to be strong enough, would have mounted. and so she laid sir alisander in
 an horse litter, and led him into the castle, for he had no foot nor might
 to stand upon the earth; for he had sixteen great wounds, and in especial
 one of them was like to be his death.
 chapter xxxvii. how queen morgan le fay had alisander in her castle, and
 how she healed his wounds.
 then queen morgan le fay searched his wounds, and gave such an ointment
 unto him that he should have died. and on the morn when she came to him he
 complained him sore; and then she put other ointments upon him, and then
 he was out of his pain. then came the damosel of the castle, and said unto
 morgan le fay: i pray you help me that this knight might wed me, for he
 hath won me with his hands. ye shall see, said morgan le fay, what i shall
 say. then morgan le fay went unto alisander, and bade in anywise that he
 should refuse this lady, an she desire to wed you, for she is not for you.
 so the damosel came and desired of him marriage. damosel, said orphelin, i
 thank you, but as yet i cast me not to marry in this country. sir, she
 said, sithen ye will not marry me, i pray you insomuch as ye have won me,
 that ye will give me to a knight of this country that hath been my friend,
 and loved me many years. with all my heart, said alisander, i will assent
 thereto. then was the knight sent for, his name was gerine le grose. and
 anon he made them handfast, and wedded them.
 then came queen morgan le fay to alisander, and bade him arise, and put
 him in an horse litter, and gave him such a drink that in three days and
 three nights he waked never, but slept; and so she brought him to her own
 castle that at that time was called la beale regard. then morgan le fay
 came to alisander, and asked him if he would fain be whole. who would be
 sick, said alisander, an he might be whole? well, said morgan le fay, then
 shall ye promise me by your knighthood that this day twelvemonth and a day
 ye shall not pass the compass of this castle, and without doubt ye shall
 lightly be whole. i assent, said sir alisander. and there he made her a
 promise: then was he soon whole. and when alisander was whole, then he
 repented him of his oath, for he might not be revenged upon king mark.
 right so there came a damosel that was cousin to the earl of pase, and she
 was cousin to morgan le fay. and by right that castle of la beale regard
 should have been hers by true inheritance. so this damosel entered into
 this castle where lay alisander, and there she found him upon his bed,
 passing heavy and all sad.
 chapter xxxviii. how alisander was delivered from queen morgan le fay by
 the means of a damosel.
 sir knight, said the damosel, an ye would be merry i could tell you good
 tidings. well were me, said alisander, an i might hear of good tidings,
 for now i stand as a prisoner by my promise. sir, she said, wit you well
 that ye be a prisoner, and worse than ye ween; for my lady, my cousin
 queen morgan le fay, keepeth you here for none other intent but for to do
 her pleasure with you when it liketh her. o jesu defend me, said
 alisander, from such pleasure; for i had liefer cut away my hangers than i
 would do her such pleasure. as jesu help me, said the damosel, an ye would
 love me and be ruled by me, i shall make your deliverance with your
 worship. tell me, said alisander, by what means, and ye shall have my
 love. fair knight, said she, this castle of right ought to be mine, and i
 have an uncle the which is a mighty earl, he is earl of pase, and of all
 folks he hateth most morgan le fay; and i shall send unto him and pray him
 for my sake to destroy this castle for the evil customs that be used
 therein; and then will he come and set wild-fire on every part of the
 castle, and i shall get you out at a privy postern, and there shall ye
 have your horse and your harness. ye say well, damosel, said alisander.
 and then she said: ye may keep the room of this castle this twelvemonth
 and a day, then break ye not your oath. truly, fair damosel, said
 alisander, ye say sooth. and then he kissed her, and did to her pleasaunce
 as it pleased them both at times and leisures.
 so anon she sent unto her uncle and bade him come and destroy that castle,
 for as the book saith, he would have destroyed that castle afore time had
 not that damosel been. when the earl understood her letters he sent her
 word again that on such a day he would come and destroy that castle. so
 when that day came she showed alisander a postern wherethrough he should
 flee into a garden, and there he should find his armour and his horse.
 when the day came that was set, thither came the earl of pase with four
 hundred knights, and set on fire all the parts of the castle, that or they
 ceased they left not a stone standing. and all this while that the fire
 was in the castle he abode in the garden. and when the fire was done he
 let make a cry that he would keep that piece of earth thereas the castle
 of la beale regard was a twelvemonth and a day, from all manner knights
 that would come
 so it happed there was a duke that hight ansirus, and he was of the kin of
 sir launcelot. and this knight was a great pilgrim, for every third year
 he would be at jerusalem. and because he used all his life to go in
 pilgrimage men called him duke ansirus the pilgrim. and this duke had a
 daughter that hight alice, that was a passing fair woman, and because of
 her father she was called alice la beale pilgrim. and anon as she heard of
 this cry she went unto arthur's court, and said openly in hearing of many
 knights, that what knight may overcome that knight that keepeth that piece
 of earth shall have me and all my lands.
 when the knights of the round table heard her say thus many were glad, for
 she was passing fair and of great rents. right so she let cry in castles
 and towns as fast on her side as alisander did on his side. then she
 dressed her pavilion straight by the piece of the earth that alisander
 kept. so she was not so soon there but there came a knight of arthur's
 court that hight sagramore le desirous, and he proffered to joust with
 alisander; and they encountered, and sagramore le desirous brised his
 spear upon sir alisander, but sir alisander smote him so hard that he
 avoided his saddle. and when la beale alice saw him joust so well, she
 thought him a passing goodly knight on horseback. and then she leapt out
 of her pavilion, and took sir alisander by the bridle, and thus she said:
 fair knight, i require thee of thy knighthood show me thy visage. i dare
 well, said alisander, show my visage. and then he put off his helm; and
 she saw his visage, she said: o sweet jesu, thee i must love, and never
 other. then show me your visage, said he.
 chapter xxxix. how alisander met with alice la beale pilgrim, and how he
 jousted with two knights; and after of him and of sir mordred.
 then she unwimpled her visage. and when he saw her he said: here have i
 found my love and my lady. truly, fair lady, said he, i promise you to be
 your knight, and none other that beareth the life. now, gentle knight,
 said she, tell me your name. my name is, said he, alisander le orphelin.
 now, damosel, tell me your name, said he. my name is, said she, alice la
 beale pilgrim. and when we be more at our heart's ease, both ye and i
 shall tell other of what blood we be come. so there was great love betwixt
 them. and as they thus talked there came a knight that hight harsouse le
 berbuse, and asked part of sir alisander's spears. then sir alisander
 encountered with him, and at the first sir alisander smote him over his
 horse's croup. and then there came another knight that hight sir hewgon,
 and sir alisander smote him down as he did that other. then sir hewgon
 proffered to do battle on foot. sir alisander overcame him with three
 strokes, and there would have slain him had he not yielded him. so then
 alisander made both those knights to swear to wear none armour in a
 twelvemonth and a day.
 then sir alisander alighted down, and went to rest him and repose him.
 then the damosel that helped sir alisander out of the castle, in her play
 told alice all together how he was prisoner in the castle of la beale
 regard, and there she told her how she got him out of prison. sir, said
 alice la beale pilgrim, meseemeth ye are much beholding to this maiden.
 that is truth, said sir alisander. and there alice told him of what blood
 she was come. sir, wit ye well, she said, that i am of the blood of king
 ban, that was father unto sir launcelot. y-wis, fair lady, said alisander,
 my mother told me that my father was brother unto a king, and i nigh
 cousin unto sir tristram.
 then this while came there three knights, that one hight vains, and the
 other hight harvis de les marches, and the third hight perin de la
 montaine. and with one spear sir alisander smote them down all three, and
 gave them such falls that they had no list to fight upon foot. so he made
 them to swear to wear none arms in a twelvemonth. so when they were
 departed sir alisander beheld his lady alice on horseback as he stood in
 her pavilion. and then was he so enamoured upon her that he wist not
 whether he were on horseback or on foot.
 right so came the false knight sir mordred, and saw sir alisander was
 assotted upon his lady; and therewithal he took his horse by the bridle,
 and led him here and there, and had cast to have led him out of that place
 to have shamed him. when the damosel that helped him out of that castle
 saw how shamefully he was led, anon she let arm her, and set a shield upon
 her shoulder; and therewith she mounted upon his horse, and gat a naked
 sword in her hand, and she thrust unto alisander with all her might, and
 she gave him such a buffet that he thought the fire flew out of his eyen.
 and when alisander felt that stroke he looked about him, and drew his
 sword and when she saw that, she fled, and so did mordred into the forest,
 and the damosel fled into the pavilion. so when alisander understood
 himself how the false knight would have shamed him had not the damosel
 been then was he wroth with himself that sir mordred was so escaped his
 hands. but then sir alisander and alice had good game at the damosel, how
 sadly she hit him upon the helm.
 then sir alisander jousted thus day by day, and on foot he did many
 battles with many knights of king arthur's court, and with many knights
 strangers. therefore to tell all the battles that he did it were overmuch
 to rehearse, for every day within that twelvemonth he had ado with one
 knight or with other, and some day he had ado with three or with four; and
 there was never knight that put him to the worse. and at the twelvemonth's
 end he departed with his lady, alice la beale pilgrim. and the damosel
 would never go from him, and so they went into their country of benoye,
 and lived there in great joy.
 chapter xl. how sir galahalt did do cry a jousts in surluse, and queen
 guenever's knights should joust against all that would come.
 but as the book saith, king mark would never stint till he had slain him
 by treason. and by alice he gat a child that hight bellengerus le beuse.
 and by good fortune he came to the court of king arthur, and proved a
 passing good knight; and he revenged his father's death, for the false
 king mark slew both sir tristram and alisander falsely and feloniously.
 and it happed so that alisander had never grace nor fortune to come to
 king arthur's court. for an he had come to sir launcelot, all knights said
 that knew him, he was one of the strongest knights that was in arthur's
 days, and great dole was made for him. so let we of him pass, and turn we
 to another tale.
 so it befell that sir galahalt, the haut prince, was lord of the country
 of surluse, whereof came many good knights. and this noble prince was a
 passing good man of arms, and ever he held a noble fellowship together.
 and then he came to arthur's court and told him his intent, how this was
 his will, how he would let cry a jousts in the country of surluse, the
 which country was within the lands of king arthur, and there he asked
 leave to let cry a jousts. i will give you leave, said king arthur; but
 wit thou well, said king arthur, i may not be there. sir, said queen
 guenever, please it you to give me leave to be at that jousts. with right
 good will, said arthur; for sir galahalt, the haut prince, shall have you
 in governance. sir, said galahalt, i will as ye will. sir, then the queen,
 i will take with me [sir launcelot] and such knights as please me best. do
 as ye list, said king arthur. so anon she commanded sir launcelot to make
 him ready with such knights as he thought best.
 so in every good town and castle of this land was made a cry, that in the
 country of surluse sir galahalt should make a joust that should last eight
 days, and how the haut prince, with the help of queen guenever's knights,
 should joust against all manner of men that would come. when this cry was
 known, kings and princes, dukes and earls, barons and noble knights, made
 them ready to be at that jousts. and at the day of jousting there came in
 sir dinadan disguised, and did many great deeds of arms.
 chapter xli. how sir launcelot fought in the tournament, and how sir
 palomides did arms there for a damosel.
 then at the request of queen guenever and of king bagdemagus sir launcelot
 came into the range, but he was disguised, and that was the cause that few
 folk knew him; and there met with him sir ector de maris, his own brother,
 and either brake their spears upon other to their hands. and then either
 gat another spear. and then sir launcelot smote down sir ector de maris,
 his own brother. that saw sir bleoberis, and he smote sir launcelot such a
 buffet upon the helm that he wist not well where he was. then sir
 launcelot was wrothy and smote sir bleoberis so sore upon the helm that
 his head bowed down backward. and he smote eft another buffet, that he
 avoided his saddle; and so he rode by, and thrust forth to the thickest.
 when the king of northgalis saw sir ector and bleoberis lie on the ground
 then was he wroth, for they came on his party against them of surluse. so
 the king of northgalis ran to sir launcelot, and brake a spear upon him
 all to pieces. therewith sir launcelot overtook the king of northgalis,
 and smote him such a buffet on the helm with his sword that he made him to
 avoid his horse; and anon the king was horsed again. so both the king
 bagdemagus' and the king of north-galis' party hurled to other; and then
 began a strong medley, but they of northgalis were far bigger.
 when sir launcelot saw his party go to the worst he thrang into the
 thickest press with a sword in his hand; and there he smote down on the
 right hand and on the left hand, and pulled down knights and raced off
 their helms, that all men had wonder that ever one knight might do such
 deeds of arms. when sir meliagaunce, that was son unto king bagdemagus,
 saw how sir launcelot fared he marvelled greatly. and when he understood
 that it was he, he wist well that he was disguised for his sake. then sir
 meliagaunce prayed a knight to slay sir launcelot's horse, either with
 sword or with spear. at that time king bagdemagus met with a knight that
 hight sauseise, a good knight, to whom he said: now fair sauseise,
 encounter with my son meliagaunce and give him large payment, for i would
 he were well beaten of thy hands, that he might depart out of this field.
 and then sir sauseise encountered with sir meliagaunce, and either smote
 other down. and then they fought on foot, and there sauseise had won sir
 meliagaunce, had there not come rescues. so then the haut prince blew to
 lodging, and every knight unarmed him and went to the great feast.
 then in the meanwhile there came a damosel to the haut prince, and
 complained that there was a knight that hight goneries that withheld her
 all her lands. then the knight was there present, and cast his glove to
 her or to any that would fight in her name. so the damosel took up the
 glove all heavily for default of a champion. then there came a varlet to
 her and said: damosel, will ye do after me? full fain, said the damosel.
 then go you unto such a knight that lieth here beside in an hermitage, and
 that followeth the questing beast, and pray him to take the battle upon
 him, and anon i wot well he will grant you.
 so anon she took her palfrey, and within a while she found that knight,
 that was sir palomides. and when she required him he armed him and rode
 with her, and made her to go to the haut prince, and to ask leave for her
 knight to do battle. i will well, said the haut prince. then the knights
 were ready in the field to joust on horseback; and either gat a spear in
 their hands, and met so fiercely together that their spears all
 to-shivered. then they flang out swords, and sir palomides smote sir
 goneries down to the earth. and then he raced off his helm and smote off
 his head. then they went to supper, and the damosel loved palomides as
 paramour, but the book saith she was of his kin. so then palomides
 disguised himself in this manner, in his shield he bare the questing
 beast, and in all his trappings. and when he was thus ready, he sent to
 the haut prince to give him leave to joust with other knights, but he was
 adoubted of sir launcelot. the haut prince sent him word again that he
 should be welcome, and that sir launcelot should not joust with him. then
 sir galahalt, the haut prince, let cry what knight somever he were that
 smote down sir palomides should have his damosel to himself.
 chapter xlii. how sir galahalt and palomides fought together, and of sir
 dinadan and sir galahalt.
 here beginneth the second day. anon as sir palomides came into the field,
 sir galahalt, the haut prince, was at the range end, and met with sir
 palomides, and he with him, with great spears. and then they came so hard
 together that their spears all to-shivered, but sir galahalt smote him so
 hard that he bare him backward over his horse, but yet he lost not his
 stirrups. then they drew their swords and lashed together many sad
 strokes, that many worshipful knights left their business to behold them.
 but at the last sir galahalt, the haut prince, smote a stroke of might
 unto palomides, sore upon the helm; but the helm was so hard that the
 sword might not bite, but slipped and smote off the head of the horse of
 sir palomides. when the haut prince wist and saw the good knight fall unto
 the earth he was ashamed of that stroke. and therewith he alighted down
 off his own horse, and prayed the good knight, palomides, to take that
 horse of his gift, and to forgive him that deed. sir, said palomides, i
 thank you of your great goodness, for ever of a man of worship a knight
 shall never have disworship; and so he mounted upon that horse, and the
 haut prince had another anon. now, said the haut prince, i release to you
 that maiden, for ye have won her. ah, said palomides, the damosel and i be
 at your commandment.
 so they departed, and sir galahalt did great deeds of arms. and right so
 came dinadan and encountered with sir galahalt, and either came to other
 so fast with their spears that their spears brake to their hands. but
 dinadan had weened the haut prince had been more weary than he was. and
 then he smote many sad strokes at the haut prince; but when dinadan saw he
 might not get him to the earth he said: my lord, i pray you leave me, and
 take another. the haut prince knew not dinadan, and left goodly for his
 fair words. and so they departed; but soon there came another and told the
 haut prince that it was dinadan. forsooth, said the prince, therefore am i
 heavy that he is so escaped from me, for with his mocks and japes now
 shall i never have done with him. and then galahalt rode fast after him,
 and bade him: abide, dinadan, for king arthur's sake. nay, said dinadan,
 so god me help, we meet no more together this day. then in that wrath the
 haut prince met with meliagaunce, and he smote him in the throat that an
 he had fallen his neck had broken; and with the same spear he smote down
 another knight. then came in they of northgalis and many strangers, and
 were like to have put them of surluse to the worse, for sir galahalt, the
 haut prince, had ever much in hand. so there came the good knight, semound
 the valiant, with forty knights, and he beat them all aback. then the
 queen guenever and sir launcelot let blow to lodging, and every knight
 unarmed him, and dressed him to the feast.
 chapter xliii. how sir archade appealed sir palomides of treason, and how
 sir palomides slew him.
 when palomides was unarmed he asked lodging for himself and the damosel.
 anon the haut prince commanded them to lodging. and he was not so soon in
 his lodging but there came a knight that hight archade, he was brother
 unto goneries that palomides slew afore in the damosel's quarrel. and this
 knight, archade, called sir palomides traitor, and appealed him for the
 death of his brother. by the leave of the haut prince, said palomides, i
 shall answer thee. when sir galahalt understood their quarrel he bade them
 go to dinner: and as soon as ye have dined look that either knight be
 ready in the field. so when they had dined they were armed both, and took
 their horses, and the queen, and the prince, and sir launcelot, were set
 to behold them; and so they let run their horses, and there sir palomides
 bare archade on his spear over his horse's tail. and then palomides
 alighted and drew his sword, but sir archade might not arise; and there
 sir palomides raced off his helm, and smote off his head. then the haut
 prince and queen guenever went unto supper. then king bagdemagus sent away
 his son meliagaunce because sir launcelot should not meet with him, for he
 hated sir launcelot, and that knew he not.
 chapter xliv. of the third day, and how sir palomides jousted with sir
 lamorak, and other things.
 now beginneth the third day of jousting; and at that day king bagdemagus
 made him ready; and there came against him king marsil, that had in gift
 an island of sir galahalt the haut prince; and this island had the name
 pomitain. then it befell that king bagdemagus and king marsil of pomitain
 met together with spears, and king marsil had such a buffet that he fell
 over his horse's croup. then came there in a knight of king marsil to
 revenge his lord, and king bagdemagus smote him down, horse and man, to
 the earth. so there came an earl that hight arrouse, and sir breuse, and
 an hundred knights with them of pomitain, and the king of northgalis was
 with them; and all these were against them of surluse. and then there
 began great battle, and many knights were cast under horses' feet. and
 ever king bagdemagus did best, for he first began, and ever he held on.
 gaheris, gawaine's brother, smote ever at the face of king bagdemagus; and
 at the last king bagdemagus hurtled down gaheris, horse and man.
 then by adventure sir palomides, the good knight, met with sir blamore de
 ganis, sir bleoberis' brother. and either smote other with great spears,
 that both their horses and knights fell to the earth. but sir blamore had
 such a fall that he had almost broken his neck, for the blood brast out at
 nose, mouth, and his ears, but at the last he recovered well by good
 surgeons. then there came in the duke chaleins of clarance; and in his
 governance there came a knight that hight elis la noire; and there
 encountered with him king bagdemagus, and he smote elis that he made him
 to avoid his saddle. so the duke chaleins of clarance did there great
 deeds of arms, and of so late as he came in the third day there was no man
 did so well except king bagdemagus and sir palomides, that the prize was
 given that day to king bagdemagus. and then they blew unto lodging, and
 unarmed them, and went to the feast. right so came dinadan, and mocked and
 japed with king bagdemagus that all knights laughed at him, for he was a
 fine japer, and well loving all good knights.
 so anon as they had dined there came a varlet bearing four spears on his
 back; and he came to palomides, and said thus: here is a knight by hath
 sent you the choice of four spears, and requireth you for your lady's sake
 to take that one half of these spears, and joust with him in the field.
 tell him, said palomides, i will not fail him. when sir galahalt wist of
 this, he bade palomides make him ready. so the queen guenever, the haut
 prince, and sir launcelot, they were set upon scaffolds to give the
 judgment of these two knights. then sir palomides and the strange knight
 ran so eagerly together that their spears brake to their hands. anon
 withal either of them took a great spear in his hand and all to-shivered
 them in pieces. and then either took a greater spear, and then the knight
 smote down sir palomides, horse and man, to the earth. and as he would
 have passed over him the strange knight's horse stumbled and fell down
 upon palomides. then they drew their swords and lashed together wonderly
 sore a great while.
 then the haut prince and sir launcelot said they saw never two knights
 fight better than they did; but ever the strange knight doubled his
 strokes, and put palomides aback; therewithal the haut prince cried: ho:
 and then they went to lodging. and when they were unarmed they knew it was
 the noble knight sir lamorak. when sir launcelot knew that it was sir
 lamorak he made much of him, for above all earthly men he loved him best
 except sir tristram. then queen guenever commended him, and so did all
 other good knights make much of him, except sir gawaine's brethren. then
 queen guenever said unto sir launcelot: sir, i require you that an ye
 joust any more, that ye joust with none of the blood of my lord arthur. so
 he promised he would not as at that time.
 chapter xlv. of the fourth day, and of many great feats of arms.
 here beginneth the fourth day. then came into the field the king with the
 hundred knights, and all they of northgalis, and the duke chaleins of
 clarance, and king marsil of pomitain, and there came safere, palomides'
 brother, and there he told him tidings of his mother. and his name was
 called the earl, and so he appealed him afore king arthur: for he made war
 upon our father and mother, and there i slew him in plain battle. so they
 went into the field, and the damosel with them; and there came to
 encounter again them sir bleoberis de ganis, and sir ector de maris. sir
 palomides encountered with sir bleoberis, and either smote other down. and
 in the same wise did sir safere and sir ector, and the two couples did
 battle on foot. then came in sir lamorak, and he encountered with the king
 with the hundred knights, and smote him quite over his horse's tail. and
 in the same wise he served the king of northgalis, and also he smote down
 king marsil. and so or ever he stint he smote down with his spear and with
 his sword thirty knights. when duke chaleins saw lamorak do so great
 prowess he would not meddle with him for shame; and then he charged all
 his knights in pain of death that none of you touch him; for it were shame
 to all good knights an that knight were shamed.
 then the two kings gathered them together, and all they set upon sir
 lamorak; and he failed them not, but rushed here and there, smiting on the
 right hand and on the left, and raced off many helms, so that the haut
 prince and queen guenever said they saw never knight do such deeds of arms
 on horseback. alas, said launcelot to king bagdemagus, i will arm me and
 help sir lamorak. and i will ride with you, said king bagdemagus. and when
 they two were horsed they came to sir lamorak that stood among thirty
 knights; and well was him that might reach him a buffet, and ever he smote
 again mightily. then came there into the press sir launcelot, and he threw
 down sir mador de la porte. and with the truncheon of that spear he threw
 down many knights. and king bagdemagus smote on the left hand and on the
 right hand marvellously well. and then the three kings fled aback.
 therewithal then sir galahalt let blow to lodging, and all the heralds
 gave sir lamorak the prize. and all this while fought palomides, sir
 bleoberis, sir safere, sir ector on foot; never were there four knights
 evener matched. and then they were departed, and had unto their lodging,
 and unarmed them, and so they went to the great feast.
 but when sir lamorak was come into the court queen guenever took him in
 her arms and said: sir, well have ye done this day. then came the haut
 prince, and he made of him great joy, and so did dinadan, for he wept for
 joy; but the joy that sir launcelot made of sir lamorak there might no man
 tell. then they went unto rest, and on the morn the haut prince let blow
 unto the field.
 chapter xlvi. of the fifth day, and how sir lamorak behaved him.
 here beginneth the fifth day. so it befell that sir palomides came in the
 morntide, and proffered to joust thereas king arthur was in a castle there
 besides surluse; and there encountered with him a worshipful duke, and
 there sir palomides smote him over his horse's croup. and this duke was
 uncle unto king arthur. then sir elise's son rode unto palomides, and
 palomides served elise in the same wise. when sir uwaine saw this he was
 wroth. then he took his horse and encountered with sir palomides, and
 palomides smote him so hard that he went to the earth, horse and man. and
 for to make a short tale, he smote down three brethren of sir gawaine,
 that is for to say mordred, gaheris, and agravaine. o jesu, said arthur,
 this is a great despite of a saracen that he shall smite down my blood.
 and therewithal king arthur was wood wroth, and thought to have made him
 ready to joust.
 that espied sir lamorak, that arthur and his blood were discomfit; and
 anon he was ready, and asked palomides if he would any more joust. why
 should i not? said palomides. then they hurtled together, and brake their
 spears, and all to-shivered them, that all the castle rang of their dints.
 then either gat a greater spear in his hand, and they came so fiercely
 together; but sir palomides' spear all to-brast and sir lamorak's did
 hold. therewithal sir palomides lost his stirrups and lay upright on his
 horse's back. and then sir palomides returned again and took his damosel,
 and sir safere returned his way.
 so, when he was departed, king arthur came to sir lamorak and thanked him
 of his goodness, and prayed him to tell him his name. sir, said lamorak,
 wit thou well, i owe you my service, but as at this time i will not abide
 here, for i see of mine enemies many about me. alas, said arthur, now wot
 i well it is sir lamorak de galis. o lamorak, abide with me, and by my
 crown i shall never fail thee: and not so hardy in gawaine's head, nor
 none of his brethren, to do thee any wrong. sir, said sir lamorak, wrong
 have they done me, and to you both. that is truth, said the king, for they
 slew their own mother and my sister, the which me sore grieveth: it had
 been much fairer and better that ye had wedded her, for ye are a king's
 son as well as they. o jesu, said the noble knight sir lamorak unto
 arthur, her death shall i never forget. i promise you, and make mine avow
 unto god, i shall revenge her death as soon as i see time convenable. and
 if it were not at the reverence of your highness i should now have been
 revenged upon sir gawaine and his brethren. truly, said arthur, i will
 make you at accord. sir, said lamorak, as at this time i may not abide
 with you, for i must to the jousts, where is sir launcelot, and the haut
 prince sir galahalt.
 then there was a damosel that was daughter to king bandes. and there was a
 saracen knight that hight corsabrin, and he loved the damosel, and in no
 wise he would suffer her to be married; for ever this corsabrin noised
 her, and named her that she was out of her mind; and thus he let her that
 she might not be married.
 chapter xlvii. how sir palomides fought with corsabrin for a lady, and how
 palomides slew corsabrin.
 so by fortune this damosel heard tell that palomides did much for
 damosels' sake; so she sent to him a pensel, and prayed him to fight with
 sir corsabrin for her love, and he should have her and her lands of her
 father's that should fall to her. then the damosel sent unto corsabrin,
 and bade him go unto sir palomides that was a paynim as well as he, and
 she gave him warning that she had sent him her pensel, and if he might
 overcome palomides she would wed him. when corsabrin wist of her deeds
 then was he wood wroth and angry, and rode unto surluse where the haut
 prince was, and there he found sir palomides ready, the which had the
 pensel. so there they waged battle either with other afore galahalt. well,
 said the haut prince, this day must noble knights joust, and at-after
 dinner we shall see how ye can speed.
 then they blew to jousts; and in came dinadan, and met with sir gerin, a
 good knight, and he threw him down over his horse's croup; and sir dinadan
 overthrew four knights more; and there he did great deeds of arms, for he
 was a good knight, but he was a scoffer and a japer, and the merriest
 knight among fellowship that was that time living. and he had such a
 custom that he loved every good knight, and every good knight loved him
 again. so then when the haut prince saw dinadan do so well, he sent unto
 sir launcelot and bade him strike down sir dinadan: and when that ye have
 done so bring him afore me and the noble queen guenever. then sir
 launcelot did as he was required. then sir lamorak and he smote down many
 knights, and raced off helms, and drove all the knights afore them. and so
 sir launcelot smote down sir dinadan, and made his men to unarm him, and
 so brought him to the queen and the haut prince, and they laughed at
 dinadan so sore that they might not stand. well, said sir dinadan, yet
 have i no shame, for the old shrew, sir launcelot, smote me down. so they
 went to dinner, [and] all the court had good sport at dinadan.
 then when the dinner was done they blew to the field to behold sir
 palomides and corsabrin. sir palomides pight his pensel in midst of the
 field; and then they hurtled together with their spears as it were
 thunder, and either smote other to the earth. and then they pulled out
 their swords, and dressed their shields, and lashed together mightily as
 mighty knights, that well-nigh there was no piece of harness would hold
 them, for this corsabrin was a passing felonious knight. corsabrin, said
 palomides, wilt thou release me yonder damosel and the pensel? then was
 corsabrin wroth out of measure, and gave palomides such a buffet that he
 kneeled on his knee. then palomides arose lightly, and smote him upon the
 helm that he fell down right to the earth. and therewith he raced off his
 helm and said: corsabrin, yield thee or else thou shalt die of my hands.
 fie on thee, said corsabrin, do thy worst. then he smote off his head. and
 therewithal came a stink of his body when the soul departed, that there
 might nobody abide the savour. so was the corpse had away and buried in a
 wood, because he was a paynim. then they blew unto lodging, and palomides
 was unarmed.
 then he went unto queen guenever, to the haut prince, and to sir
 launcelot. sir, said the haut prince, here have ye seen this day a great
 miracle by corsabrin, what savour there was when the soul departed from
 the body. therefore, sir, we will require you to take the baptism upon
 you, and i promise you all knights will set the more by you, and say more
 worship by you. sir, said palomides, i will that ye all know that into
 this land i came to be christened, and in my heart i am christened and
 christened will i be. but i have made such an avow that i may not be
 christened till i have done seven true battles for jesu's sake, and then
 will i be christened; and i trust god will take mine intent, for i mean
 truly then sir palomides prayed queen guenever and the haut prince to sup
 with him. and so they did, both sir launcelot and sir lamorak, and many
 other good knights. so on the morn they heard their mass, and blew the
 field, and then knights made them ready.
 chapter xlviii. of the sixth day, and what then was done.
 here beginneth the sixth day. then came therein sir gaheris, and there
 encountered with him sir ossaise of surluse, and sir gaheris smote him
 over his horse's croup. and then either party encountered with other, and
 there were many spears broken, and many knights cast under feet. so there
 came in sir dornard and sir aglovale, that were brethren unto sir lamorak,
 and they met with other two knights, and either smote other so hard that
 all four knights and horses fell to the earth. when sir lamorak saw his
 two brethren down he was wroth out of measure, and then he gat a great
 spear in his hand, and therewithal he smote down four good knights, and
 then his spear brake. then he pulled out his sword, and smote about him on
 the right hand and on the left hand, and raced off helms and pulled down
 knights, that all men marvelled of such deeds of arms as he did, for he
 fared so that many knights fled. then he horsed his brethren again, and
 said: brethren, ye ought to be ashamed to fall so off your horses! what is
 a knight but when he is on horseback? i set not by a knight when he is on
 foot, for all battles on foot are but pillers' battles. for there should
 no knight fight on foot but if it were for treason, or else he were driven
 thereto by force; therefore, brethren, sit fast on your horses, or else
 fight never more afore me.
 with that came in the duke chaleins of clarance, and there encountered
 with him the earl ulbawes of surluse, and either of them smote other down.
 then the knights of both parties horsed their lords again, for sir ector
 and bleoberis were on foot, waiting on the duke chaleins. and the king
 with the hundred knights was with the earl of ulbawes. with that came
 gaheris and lashed to the king with the hundred knights, and he to him
 again. then came the duke chaleins and departed them.
 then they blew to lodging, and the knights unarmed them and drew them to
 their dinner; and at the midst of their dinner in came dinadan and began
 to rail. then he beheld the haut prince, that seemed wroth with some fault
 that he saw; for he had a custom he loved no fish, and because he was
 served with fish, the which he hated, therefore he was not merry. when sir
 dinadan had espied the haut prince, he espied where was a fish with a
 great head, and that he gat betwixt two dishes, and served the haut prince
 with that fish. and then he said thus: sir galahalt, well may i liken you
 to a wolf, for he will never eat fish, but flesh; then the haut prince
 laughed at his words. well, well, said dinadan to launcelot, what devil do
 ye in this country, for here may no mean knights win no worship for thee.
 sir dinadan, said launcelot, i ensure thee i shall no more meet with thee
 nor with thy great spear, for i may not sit in my saddle when that spear
 hitteth me. and if i be happy i shall beware of that boistous body that
 thou bearest. well, said launcelot, make good watch ever: god forbid that
 ever we meet but if it be at a dish of meat. then laughed the queen and
 the haut prince, that they might not sit at their table; thus they made
 great joy till on the morn, and then they heard mass, and blew to field.
 and queen guenever and all the estates were set, and judges armed clean
 with their shields to keep the right.
 chapter xlix. of the seventh battle, and how sir launcelot, being
 disguised like a maid, smote down sir dinadan.
 now beginneth the seventh battle. there came in the duke cambines, and
 there encountered with him sir aristance, that was counted a good knight,
 and they met so hard that either bare other down, horse and man. then came
 there the earl of lambaile and helped the duke again to horse. then came
 there sir ossaise of surluse, and he smote the earl lambaile down from his
 horse. then began they to do great deeds of arms, and many spears were
 broken, and many knights were cast to the earth. then the king of
 northgalis and the earl ulbawes smote together that all the judges thought
 it was like mortal death. this meanwhile queen guenever, and the haut
 prince, and sir launcelot, made there sir dinadan make him ready to joust.
 i would, said dinadan, ride into the field, but then one of you twain will
 meet with me. per dieu, said the haut prince, ye may see how we sit here
 as judges with our shields, and always mayest thou behold whether we sit
 here or not.
 so sir dinadan departed and took his horse, and met with many knights, and
 did passing well. and as he was departed, sir launcelot disguised himself,
 and put upon his armour a maiden's garment freshly attired. then sir
 launcelot made sir galihodin to lead him through the range, and all men
 had wonder what damosel it was. and so as sir dinadan came into the range,
 sir launcelot, that was in the damosel's array, gat galihodin's spear, and
 ran unto sir dinadan. and always sir dinadan looked up thereas sir
 launcelot was, and then he saw one sit in the stead of sir launcelot,
 armed. but when dinadan saw a manner of a damosel he dread perils that it
 was sir launcelot disguised, but sir launcelot came on him so fast that he
 smote him over his horse's croup; and then with great scorns they gat sir
 dinadan into the forest there beside, and there they dispoiled him unto
 his shirt, and put upon him a woman's garment, and so brought him into the
 field: and so they blew unto lodging. and every knight went and unarmed
 them. then was sir dinadan brought in among them all. and when queen
 guenever saw sir dinadan brought so among them all, then she laughed that
 she fell down, and so did all that there were. well, said dinadan to
 launcelot, thou art so false that i can never beware of thee. then by all
 the assent they gave sir launcelot the prize, the next was sir lamorak de
 galis, the third was sir palomides, the fourth was king bagdemagus; so
 these four knights had the prize, and there was great joy, and great
 nobley in all the court.
 and on the morn queen guenever and sir launcelot departed unto king
 arthur, but in no wise sir lamorak would not go with them. i shall
 undertake, said sir launcelot, that an ye will go with us king arthur
 shall charge sir gawaine and his brethren never to do you hurt. as for
 that, said sir lamorak, i will not trust sir gawaine nor none of his
 brethren; and wit ye well, sir launcelot, an it were not for my lord king
 arthur's sake, i should match sir gawaine and his brethren well enough.
 but to say that i should trust them, that shall i never, and therefore i
 pray you recommend me unto my lord arthur, and unto all my lords of the
 round table. and in what place that ever i come i shall do you service to
 my power: and sir, it is but late that i revenged that, when my lord
 arthur's kin were put to the worse by sir palomides. then sir lamorak
 departed from sir launcelot, and either wept at their departing.
 chapter l. how by treason sir tristram was brought to a tournament for to
 have been slain, and how he was put in prison.
 now turn we from this matter, and speak we of sir tristram, of whom this
 book is principally of, and leave we the king and the queen, sir
 launcelot, and sir lamorak, and here beginneth the treason of king mark,
 that he ordained against sir tristram. there was cried by the coasts of
 cornwall a great tournament and jousts, and all was done by sir galahalt
 the haut prince and king bagdemagus, to the intent to slay launcelot, or
 else utterly destroy him and shame him, because sir launcelot had always
 the higher degree, therefore this prince and this king made this jousts
 against sir launcelot. and thus their counsel was discovered unto king
 mark, whereof he was full glad.
 then king mark bethought him that he would have sir tristram unto that
 tournament disguised that no man should know him, to that intent that the
 haut prince should ween that sir tristram were sir launcelot. so at these
 jousts came in sir tristram. and at that time sir launcelot was not there,
 but when they saw a knight disguised do such deeds of arms, they weened it
 had been sir launcelot. and in especial king mark said it was sir
 launcelot plainly. then they set upon him, both king bagdemagus, and the
 haut prince, and their knights, that it was wonder that ever sir tristram
 might endure that pain. notwithstanding for all the pain that he had, sir
 tristram won the degree at that tournament, and there he hurt many knights
 and bruised them, and they hurt him and bruised him wonderly sore. so when
 the jousts were all done they knew well that it was sir tristram de
 liones; and all that were on king mark's party were glad that sir tristram
 was hurt, and the remnant were sorry of his hurt; for sir tristram was not
 so behated as was sir launcelot within the realm of england.
 then came king mark unto sir tristram and said: fair nephew, i am sorry of
 your hurts. gramercy my lord, said sir tristram. then king mark made sir
 tristram to be put in an horse bier in great sign of love, and said: fair
 cousin, i shall be your leech myself. and so he rode forth with sir
 tristram, and brought him to a castle by daylight. and then king mark made
 sir tristram to eat. and then after he gave him a drink, the which as soon
 as he had drunk he fell asleep. and when it was night he made him to be
 carried to another castle, and there he put him in a strong prison, and
 there he ordained a man and a woman to give him his meat and drink. so
 there he was a great while.
 then was sir tristram missed, and no creature wist where he was become.
 when la beale isoud heard how he was missed, privily she went unto sir
 sadok, and prayed him to espy where was sir tristram. then when sadok wist
 how sir tristram was missed, and anon espied that he was put in prison by
 king mark and the traitors of magouns, then sadok and two of his cousins
 laid them in an ambushment, fast by the castle of tintagil, in arms. and
 as by fortune, there came riding king mark and four of his nephews, and a
 certain of the traitors of magouns. when sir sadok espied them he brake
 out of the bushment, and set there upon them. and when king mark espied
 sir sadok he fled as fast as he might, and there sir sadok slew all the
 four nephews unto king mark. but these traitors of magouns slew one of
 sadok's cousins with a great wound in the neck, but sadok smote the other
 to the death. then sir sadok rode upon his way unto a castle that was
 called liones, and there he espied of the treason and felony of king mark.
 so they of that castle rode with sir sadok till that they came to a castle
 that hight arbray, and there in the town they found sir dinas the
 seneschal, that was a good knight. but when sir sadok had told sir dinas
 of all the treason of king mark he defied such a king, and said he would
 give up his lands that he held of him. and when he said these words all
 manner knights said as sir dinas said. then by his advice and of sir
 sadok's, he let stuff all the towns and castles within the country of
 liones, and assembled all the people that they might make.
 chapter li. how king mark let do counterfeit letters from the pope, and
 how sir percivale delivered sir tristram out of prison.
 now turn we unto king mark, that when he was escaped from sir sadok he
 rode unto the castle of tintagil, and there he made great cry and noise,
 and cried unto harness all that might bear arms. then they sought and
 found where were dead four cousins of king mark's, and the traitor of
 magouns. then the king let inter them in a chapel. then the king let cry
 in all the country that held of him, to go unto arms, for he understood to
 the war he must needs. when king mark heard and understood how sir sadok
 and sir dinas were arisen in the country of liones he remembered of wiles
 and treason. lo thus he did: he let make and counterfeit letters from the
 pope, and did make a strange clerk to bear them unto king mark; the which
 letters specified that king mark should make him ready, upon pain of
 cursing, with his host to come to the pope, to help to go to jerusalem,
 for to make war upon the saracens.
 when this clerk was come by the mean of the king, anon withal king mark
 sent these letters unto sir tristram and bade him say thus: that an he
 would go war upon the miscreants, he should be had out of prison, and to
 have all his power. when sir tristram understood this letter, then he said
 thus to the clerk: ah, king mark, ever hast thou been a traitor, and ever
 will be; but, clerk, said sir tristram, say thou thus unto king mark:
 since the apostle pope hath sent for him, bid him go thither himself; for
 tell him, traitor king as he is, i will not go at his commandment, get i
 out of prison as i may, for i see i am well rewarded for my true service.
 then the clerk returned unto king mark, and told him of the answer of sir
 tristram. well, said king mark, yet shall he be beguiled. so he went into
 his chamber, and counterfeit letters; and the letters specified that the
 pope desired sir tristram to come himself, to make war upon the
 miscreants. when the clerk was come again to sir tristram and took him
 these letters, then sir tristram beheld these letters, and anon espied
 they were of king mark's counterfeiting. ah, said sir tristram, false hast
 thou been ever, king mark, and so wilt thou end. then the clerk departed
 from sir tristram and came to king mark again.
 by then there were come four wounded knights within the castle of
 tintagil, and one of them his neck was nigh broken in twain. another had
 his arm stricken away, the third was borne through with a spear, the
 fourth had his teeth stricken in twain. and when they came afore king mark
 they cried and said: king, why fleest thou not, for all this country is
 arisen clearly against thee? then was king mark wroth out of measure.
 and in the meanwhile there came into the country sir percivale de galis to
 seek sir tristram. and when he heard that sir tristram was in prison, sir
 percivale made clearly the deliverance of sir tristram by his knightly
 means. and when he was so delivered he made great joy of sir percivale,
 and so each one of other. sir tristram said unto sir percivale: an ye will
 abide in these marches i will ride with you. nay, said percivale, in this
 country i may not tarry, for i must needs into wales. so sir percivale
 departed from sir tristram, and rode straight unto king mark, and told him
 how he had delivered sir tristram; and also he told the king that he had
 done himself great shame for to put sir tristram in prison, for he is now
 the knight of most renown in this world living. and wit thou well the
 noblest knights of the world love sir tristram, and if he will make war
 upon you ye may not abide it. that is truth, said king mark, but i may not
 love sir tristram because he loveth my queen and my wife, la beale isoud.
 ah, fie for shame, said sir percivale, say ye never so more. are ye not
 uncle unto sir tristram, and he your nephew? ye should never think that so
 noble a knight as sir tristram is, that he would do himself so great a
 villainy to hold his uncle's wife; howbeit, said sir percivale, he may
 love your queen sinless, because she is called one of the fairest ladies
 of the world.
 then sir percivale departed from king mark. so when he was departed king
 mark bethought him of more treason: notwithstanding king mark granted sir
 percivale never by no manner of means to hurt sir tristram. so anon king
 mark sent unto sir dinas the seneschal that he should put down all the
 people that he had raised, for he sent him an oath that he would go
 himself unto the pope of rome to war upon the miscreants; and this is a
 fairer war than thus to arise the people against your king. when sir dinas
 understood that king mark would go upon the miscreants, then sir dinas in
 all the haste put down all the people; and when the people were departed
 every man to his home, then king mark espied where was sir tristram with
 la beale isoud; and there by treason king mark let take him and put him in
 prison, contrary to his promise that he made unto sir percivale.
 when queen isoud understood that sir tristram was in prison she made as
 great sorrow as ever made lady or gentlewoman. then sir tristram sent a
 letter unto la beale isoud, and prayed her to be his good lady; and if it
 pleased her to make a vessel ready for her and him, he would go with her
 unto the realm of logris, that is this land. when la beale isoud
 understood sir tristram's letters and his intent, she sent him another,
 and bade him be of good comfort, for she would do make the vessel ready,
 and all thing to purpose.
 then la beale isoud sent unto sir dinas, and to sadok, and prayed them in
 anywise to take king mark, and put him in prison, unto the time that she
 and sir tristram were departed unto the realm of logris. when sir dinas
 the seneschal understood the treason of king mark he promised her again,
 and sent her word that king mark should be put in prison. and as they
 devised it so it was done. and then sir tristram was delivered out of
 prison; and anon in all the haste queen isoud and sir tristram went and
 took their counsel with that they would have with them when they departed.
 chapter lii. how sir tristram and la beale isoud came unto england, and
 how sir launcelot brought them to joyous gard.
 then la beale isoud and sir tristram took their vessel, and came by water
 into this land. and so they were not in this land four days but there came
 a cry of a jousts and tournament that king arthur let make. when sir
 tristram heard tell of that tournament he disguised himself, and la beale
 isoud, and rode unto that tournament. and when he came there he saw many
 knights joust and tourney; and so sir tristram dressed him to the range,
 and to make short conclusion, he overthrew fourteen knights of the round
 table. when sir launcelot saw these knights thus overthrown, sir launcelot
 dressed him to sir tristram. that saw la beale isoud how sir launcelot was
 come into the field. then la beale isoud sent unto sir launcelot a ring,
 and bade him wit that it was sir tristram de liones. when sir launcelot
 under stood that there was sir tristram he was full glad, and would not
 joust. then sir launcelot espied whither sir tristram yede, and after him
 he rode; and then either made of other great joy. and so sir launcelot
 brought sir tristram and la beale isoud unto joyous gard, that was his own
 castle, that he had won with his own hands. and there sir launcelot put
 them in to wield for their own. and wit ye well that castle was garnished
 and furnished for a king and a queen royal there to have sojourned. and
 sir launcelot charged all his people to honour them and love them as they
 would do himself.
 so sir launcelot departed unto king arthur; and then he told queen
 guenever how he that jousted so well at the last tournament was sir
 tristram. and there he told her how he had with him la beale isoud maugre
 king mark, and so queen guenever told all this unto king arthur. when king
 arthur wist that sir tristram was escaped and come from king mark, and had
 brought la beale isoud with him, then was he passing glad. so because of
 sir tristram king arthur let make a cry, that on may day should be a
 jousts before the castle of lonazep; and that castle was fast by joyous
 gard. and thus arthur devised, that all the knights of this land, and of
 cornwall, and of north wales, should joust against all these countries,
 ireland, scotland, and the remnant of wales, and the country of gore, and
 surluse, and of listinoise, and they of northumberland, and all they that
 held lands of arthur on this half the sea. when this cry was made many
 knights were glad and many were unglad. sir, said launcelot unto arthur,
 by this cry that ye have made ye will put us that be about you in great
 jeopardy, for there be many knights that have great envy to us; therefore
 when we shall meet at the day of jousts there will be hard shift among us.
 as for that, said arthur, i care not; there shall we prove who shall be
 best of his hands. so when sir launcelot understood wherefore king arthur
 made this jousting, then he made such purveyance that la beale isoud
 should behold the jousts in a secret place that was honest for her estate.
 now turn we unto sir tristram and to la beale isoud, how they made great
 joy daily together with all manner of mirths that they could devise; and
 every day sir tristram would go ride a-hunting, for sir tristram was that
 time called the best chaser of the world, and the noblest blower of an
 horn of all manner of measures; for as books report, of sir tristram came
 all the good terms of venery and hunting, and all the sizes and measures
 of blowing of an horn; and of him we had first all the terms of hawking,
 and which were beasts of chase and beasts of venery, and which were
 vermins, and all the blasts that long to all manner of games. first to the
 uncoupling, to the seeking, to the rechate, to the flight, to the death,
 and to strake, and many other blasts and terms, that all manner of
 gentlemen have cause to the world's end to praise sir tristram, and to
 pray for his soul.
 chapter liii. how by the counsel of la beale isoud sir tristram rode
 armed, and how he met with sir palomides.
 so on a day la beale isoud said unto sir tristram: i marvel me much, said
 she, that ye remember not yourself, how ye be here in a strange country,
 and here be many perilous knights; and well ye wot that king mark is full
 of treason; and that ye will ride thus to chase and to hunt unarmed ye
 might be destroyed. my fair lady and my love, i cry you mercy, i will no
 more do so. so then sir tristram rode daily a-hunting armed, and his men
 bearing his shield and his spear. so on a day a little afore the month of
 may, sir tristram chased an hart passing eagerly, and so the hart passed
 by a fair well. and then sir tristram alighted and put off his helm to
 drink of that bubbly water. right so he heard and saw the questing beast
 come to the well. when sir tristram saw that beast he put on his helm, for
 he deemed he should hear of sir palomides, for that beast was his quest.
 right so sir tristram saw where came a knight armed, upon a noble courser,
 and he saluted him, and they spake of many things; and this knight's name
 was breuse saunce pité. and right so withal there came unto them the noble
 knight sir palomides, and either saluted other, and spake fair to other.
 fair knights, said sir palomides, i can tell you tidings. what is that?
 said those knights. sirs, wit ye well that king mark is put in prison by
 his own knights, and all was for love of sir tristram; for king mark had
 put sir tristram twice in prison, and once sir percivale delivered the
 noble knight sir tristram out of prison. and at the last time queen la
 beale isoud delivered him, and went clearly away with him into this realm;
 and all this while king mark, the false traitor, is in prison. is this
 truth? said palomides; then shall we hastily hear of sir tristram. and as
 for to say that i love la beale isoud paramours, i dare make good that i
 do, and that she hath my service above all other ladies, and shall have
 the term of my life.
 and right so as they stood talking they saw afore them where came a knight
 all armed, on a great horse, and one of his men bare his shield, and the
 other his spear. and anon as that knight espied them he gat his shield and
 his spear and dressed him to joust. fair fellows, said sir tristram,
 yonder is a knight will joust with us, let see which of us shall encounter
 with him, for i see well he is of the court of king arthur. it shall not
 be long or he be met withal, said sir palomides, for i found never no
 knight in my quest of this glasting beast, but an he would joust i never
 refused him. as well may i, said breuse saunce pité, follow that beast as
 ye. then shall ye do battle with me, said palomides.
 so sir palomides dressed him unto that other knight, sir bleoberis, that
 was a full noble knight, nigh kin unto sir launcelot. and so they met so
 hard that sir palomides fell to the earth, horse and all. then sir
 bleoberis cried aloud and said thus: make thee ready thou false traitor
 knight, breuse saunce pité, for wit thou certainly i will have ado with
 thee to the utterance for the noble knights and ladies that thou hast
 falsely betrayed. when this false knight and traitor, breuse saunce pité,
 heard him say so, he took his horse by the bridle and fled his way as fast
 as ever his horse might run, for sore he was of him afeard. when sir
 bleoberis saw him flee he followed fast after, through thick and through
 thin. and by fortune as sir breuse fled, he saw even afore him three
 knights of the table round, of the which the one hight sir ector de maris,
 the other hight sir percivale de galis, the third hight sir harry le fise
 lake, a good knight and an hardy. and as for sir percivale, he was called
 that time of his time one of the best knights of the world, and the best
 assured. when breuse saw these knights he rode straight unto them, and
 cried unto them and prayed them of rescues. what need have ye? said sir
 ector. ah, fair knights, said sir breuse, here followeth me the most
 traitor knight, and most coward, and most of villainy; his name is breuse
 saunce pité, and if he may get me he will slay me without mercy and pity.
 abide with us, said sir percivale, and we shall warrant you.
 then were they ware of sir bleoberis that came riding all that he might.
 then sir ector put himself forth to joust afore them all. when sir
 bleoberis saw that they were four knights and he but himself, he stood in
 a doubt whether he would turn or hold his way. then he said to himself: i
 am a knight of the table round, and rather than i should shame mine oath
 and my blood i will hold my way whatsoever fall thereof. and then sir
 ector dressed his spear, and smote either other passing sore, but sir
 ector fell to the earth. that saw sir percivale, and he dressed his horse
 toward him all that he might drive, but sir percivale had such a stroke
 that horse and man fell to the earth. when sir harry saw that they were
 both to the earth then he said to himself: never was breuse of such
 prowess. so sir harry dressed his horse, and they met together so strongly
 that both the horses and knights fell to the earth, but sir bleoberis'
 horse began to recover again. that saw breuse and he came hurtling, and
 smote him over and over, and would have slain him as he lay on the ground.
 then sir harry le fise lake arose lightly, and took the bridle of sir
 breuse's horse, and said: fie for shame! strike never a knight when he is
 at the earth, for this knight may be called no shameful knight of his
 deeds, for yet as men may see thereas he lieth on the ground he hath done
 worshipfully, and put to the worse passing good knights. therefore will i
 not let, said sir breuse. thou shalt not choose, said sir harry, as at
 this time. then when sir breuse saw that he might not choose nor have his
 will he spake fair. then sir harry let him go. and then anon he made his
 horse to run over sir bleoberis, and rashed him to the earth like if he
 would have slain him. when sir harry saw him do so villainously he cried:
 traitor knight, leave off for shame. and as sir harry would have taken his
 horse to fight with sir breuse, then sir breuse ran upon him as he was
 half upon his horse, and smote him down, horse and man, to the earth, and
 had near slain sir harry, the good knight. that saw sir percivale, and
 then he cried: traitor knight what dost thou? and when sir percivale was
 upon his horse sir breuse took his horse and fled all that ever he might,
 and sir percivale and sir harry followed after him fast, but ever the
 longer they chased the farther were they behind.
 then they turned again and came to sir ector de maris and to sir
 bleoberis. ah, fair knights, said bleoberis, why have ye succoured that
 false knight and traitor? why said sir harry, what knight is he? for well
 i wot it is a false knight, said sir harry, and a coward and a felonious
 knight. sir, said bleoberis, he is the most coward knight, and a devourer
 of ladies and a destroyer of good knights and especially of arthur's. what
 is your name? said sir ector. my name is sir bleoberis de ganis. alas,
 fair cousin, said ector, forgive it me, for i am sir ector de maris. then
 sir percivale and sir harry made great joy that they met with bleoberis,
 but all they were heavy that sir breuse was escaped them, whereof they
 made great dole.
 chapter liv. of sir palomides, and how he met with sir bleoberis and with
 sir ector, and of sir pervivale.
 right so as they stood thus there came sir palomides, and when he saw the
 shield of bleoberis lie on the earth, then said palomides: he that oweth
 that shield let him dress him to me, for he smote me down here fast by at
 a fountain, and therefore i will fight for him on foot. i am ready, said
 bleoberis, here to answer thee, for wit thou well, sir knight, it was i,
 and my name is bleoberis de ganis. well art thou met, said palomides, and
 wit thou well my name is palomides the saracen; and either of them hated
 other to the death. sir palomides, said ector, wit thou well there is
 neither thou nor none knight that beareth the life that slayeth any of our
 blood but he shall die for it; therefore an thou list to fight go seek sir
 launcelot or sir tristram, and there shall ye find your match. with them
 have i met, said palomides, but i had never no worship of them. was there
 never no manner of knight, said sir ector, but they that ever matched with
 you? yes, said palomides, there was the third, a good knight as any of
 them, and of his age he was the best that ever i found; for an he might
 have lived till he had been an hardier man there liveth no knight now
 such, and his name was sir lamorak de galis. and as he had jousted at a
 tournament there he overthrew me and thirty knights more, and there he won
 the degree. and at his departing there met him sir gawaine and his
 brethren, and with great pain they slew him feloniously, unto all good
 knights' great damage. anon as sir percivale heard that his brother was
 dead, sir lamorak, he fell over his horse's mane swooning, and there he
 made the greatest dole that ever made knight. and when sir percivale arose
 he said: alas, my good and noble brother sir lamorak, now shall we never
 meet, and i trow in all the wide world a man may not find such a knight as
 he was of his age; and it is too much to suffer the death of our father
 king pellinore, and now the death of our good brother sir lamorak.
 then in the meanwhile there came a varlet from the court of king arthur,
 and told them of the great tournament that should be at lonazep, and how
 these lands, cornwall and northgalis, should be against all them that
 would come.
 chapter lv. how sir tristram met with sir dinadan, and of their devices,
 and what he said to sir gawaine's brethren.
 now turn we unto sir tristram, that as he rode a-hunting he met with sir
 dinadan, that was come into that country to seek sir tristram. then sir
 dinadan told sir tristram his name, but sir tristram would not tell him
 his name, wherefore sir dinadan was wroth. for such a foolish knight as ye
 are, said sir dinadan, i saw but late this day lying by a well, and he
 fared as he slept; and there he lay like a fool grinning, and would not
 speak, and his shield lay by him, and his horse stood by him; and well i
 wot he was a lover. ah, fair sir, said sir tristram are ye not a lover?
 mary, fie on that craft! said sir dinadan. that is evil said, said sir
 tristram, for a knight may never be of prowess but if he be a lover. it is
 well said, said sir dinadan; now tell me your name, sith ye be a lover, or
 else i shall do battle with you. as for that, said sir tristram, it is no
 reason to fight with me but i tell you my name; and as for that my name
 shall ye not wit as at this time. fie for shame, said dinadan, art thou a
 knight and durst not tell thy name to me? therefore i will fight with
 thee. as for that, said sir tristram, i will be advised, for i will not do
 battle but if me list. and if i do battle, said sir tristram, ye are not
 able to withstand me. fie on thee, coward, said sir dinadan.
 and thus as they hoved still, they saw a knight come riding against them.
 lo, said sir tristram, see where cometh a knight riding, will joust with
 you. anon, as sir dinadan beheld him he said: that is the same doted
 knight that i saw lie by the well, neither sleeping nor waking. well, said
 sir tristram, i know that knight well with the covered shield of azure, he
 is the king's son of northumberland, his name is epinegris; and he is as
 great a lover as i know, and he loveth the king's daughter of wales, a
 full fair lady. and now i suppose, said sir tristram, an ye require him he
 will joust with you, and then shall ye prove whether a lover be a better
 knight, or ye that will not love no lady. well, said dinadan, now shalt
 thou see what i shall do. therewithal sir dinadan spake on high and said:
 sir knight, make thee ready to joust with me, for it is the custom of
 errant knights one to joust with other. sir, said epinegris, is that the
 rule of you errant knights for to make a knight to joust, will he or nill?
 as for that, said dinadan, make thee ready, for here is for me. and
 therewithal they spurred their horses and met together so hard that
 epinegris smote down sir dinadan. then sir tristram rode to sir dinadan
 and said: how now, meseemeth the lover hath well sped. fie on thee,
 coward, said sir dinadan, and if thou be a good knight revenge me. nay,
 said sir tristram, i will not joust as at this time, but take your horse
 and let us go hence. god defend me, said sir dinadan, from thy fellowship,
 for i never sped well since i met with thee: and so they departed. well,
 said sir tristram, peradventure i could tell you tidings of sir tristram.
 god defend me, said dinadan, from thy fellowship, for sir tristram were
 mickle the worse an he were in thy company; and then they departed. sir,
 said sir tristram, yet it may happen i shall meet with you in other
 places.
 so rode sir tristram unto joyous gard, and there he heard in that town
 great noise and cry. what is this noise? said sir tristram. sir, said
 they, here is a knight of this castle that hath been long among us, and
 right now he is slain with two knights, and for none other cause but that
 our knight said that sir launcelot were a better knight than sir gawaine.
 that was a simple cause, said sir tristram, for to slay a good knight for
 to say well by his master. that is little remedy to us, said the men of
 the town. for an sir launcelot had been here soon we should have been
 revenged upon the false knights.
 when sir tristram heard them say so he sent for his shield and for his
 spear, and lightly within a while he had overtaken them, and bade them
 turn and amend that they had misdone. what amends wouldst thou have? said
 the one knight. and therewith they took their course, and either met other
 so hard that sir tristram smote down that knight over his horse's tail.
 then the other knight dressed him to sir tristram, and in the same wise he
 served the other knight. and then they gat off their horses as well as
 they might, and dressed their shields and swords to do their battle to the
 utterance. knights, said sir tristram, ye shall tell me of whence ye are,
 and what be your names, for such men ye might be ye should hard escape my
 hands; and ye might be such men of such a country that for all your evil
 deeds ye should pass quit. wit thou well, sir knight, said they, we fear
 not to tell thee our names, for my name is sir agravaine, and my name is
 gaheris, brethren unto the good knight sir gawaine, and we be nephews unto
 king arthur. well, said sir tristram, for king arthur's sake i shall let
 you pass as at this time. but it is shame, said sir tristram, that sir
 gawaine and ye be come of so great a blood that ye four brethren are so
 named as ye be, for ye be called the greatest destroyers and murderers of
 good knights that be now in this realm; for it is but as i heard say that
 sir gawaine and ye slew among you a better knight than ever ye were, that
 was the noble knight sir lamorak de galis. an it had pleased god, said sir
 tristram, i would i had been by sir lamorak at his death. then shouldst
 thou have gone the same way, said sir gaheris. fair knight, said sir
 tristram, there must have been many more knights than ye are. and
 therewithal sir tristram departed from them toward joyous gard. and when
 he was departed they took their horses, and the one said to the other: we
 will overtake him and be revenged upon him in the despite of sir lamorak.
 chapter lvi. how sir tristram smote down sir agravaine and sir gaheris,
 and how sir dinadan was sent for by la beale isoud.
 so when they had overtaken sir tristram, sir agravaine bade him: turn,
 traitor knight. that is evil said, said sir tristram; and therewith he
 pulled out his sword, and smote sir agravaine such a buffet upon the helm
 that he tumbled down off his horse in a swoon, and he had a grievous
 wound. and then he turned to gaheris, and sir tristram smote his sword and
 his helm together with such a might that gaheris fell out of his saddle:
 and so sir tristram rode unto joyous gard, and there he alighted and
 unarmed him. so sir tristram told la beale isoud of all his adventure, as
 ye have heard to-fore. and when she heard him tell of sir dinadan: sir,
 said she, is not that he that made the song by king mark? that same is he,
 said sir tristram, for he is the best bourder and japer, and a noble
 knight of his hands, and the best fellow that i know, and all good knights
 love his fellowship. alas, sir, said she, why brought ye not him with you?
 have ye no care, said sir tristram, for he rideth to seek me in this
 country; and therefore he will not away till he have met with me. and
 there sir tristram told la beale isoud how sir dinadan held against all
 lovers. right so there came in a varlet and told sir tristram how there
 was come an errant knight into the town, with such colours upon his
 shield. that is sir dinadan, said sir tristram; wit ye what ye shall do,
 said sir tristram: send ye for him, my lady isoud, and i will not be seen,
 and ye shall hear the merriest knight that ever ye spake withal, and the
 maddest talker; and i pray you heartily that ye make him good cheer.
 then anon la beale isoud sent into the town, and prayed sir dinadan that
 he would come into the castle and repose him there with a lady. with a
 good will, said sir dinadan; and so he mounted upon his horse and rode
 into the castle; and there he alighted, and was unarmed, and brought into
 the castle. anon la beale isoud came unto him, and either saluted other;
 then she asked him of whence that he was. madam, said dinadan, i am of the
 court of king arthur, and knight of the table round, and my name is sir
 dinadan. what do ye in this country? said la beale isoud. madam, said he,
 i seek sir tristram the good knight, for it was told me that he was in
 this country. it may well be, said la beale isoud, but i am not ware of
 him. madam, said dinadan, i marvel of sir tristram and mo other lovers,
 what aileth them to be so mad and so sotted upon women. why, said la beale
 isoud, are ye a knight and be no lover? it is shame to you: wherefore ye
 may not be called a good knight [but] if ye make a quarrel for a lady. god
 defend me, said dinadan, for the joy of love is too short, and the sorrow
 thereof, and what cometh thereof, dureth over long. ah, said la beale
 isoud, say ye not so, for here fast by was the good knight sir bleoberis,
 that fought with three knights at once for a damosel's sake, and he won
 her afore the king of northumberland. it was so, said sir dinadan, for i
 know him well for a good knight and a noble, and come of noble blood; for
 all be noble knights of whom he is come of, that is sir launcelot du lake.
 now i pray you, said la beale isoud, tell me will you fight for my love
 with three knights that do me great wrong? and insomuch as ye be a knight
 of king arthur's i require you to do battle for me. then sir dinadan said:
 i shall say you ye be as fair a lady as ever i saw any, and much fairer
 than is my lady queen guenever, but wit ye well at one word, i will not
 fight for you with three knights, jesu defend me. then isoud laughed, and
 had good game at him. so he had all the cheer that she might make him, and
 there he lay all that night. and on the morn early sir tristram armed him,
 and la beale isoud gave him a good helm; and then he promised her that he
 would meet with sir dinadan, and they two would ride together into
 lonazep, where the tournament should be: and there shall i make ready for
 you where ye shall see the tournament. then departed sir tristram with two
 squires that bare his shield and his spears that were great and long.
 chapter lvii. how sir dinadan met with sir tristram, and with jousting
 with sir palomides, sir dinadan knew him.
 then after that sir dinadan departed, and rode his way a great pace until
 he had overtaken sir tristram. and when sir dinadan had overtaken him he
 knew him anon, and he hated the fellowship of him above all other knights.
 ah, said sir dinadan, art thou that coward knight that i met with
 yesterday? keep thee, for thou shalt joust with me maugre thy head. well,
 said sir tristram, and i am loath to joust. and so they let their horses
 run, and sir tristram missed of him a-purpose, and sir dinadan brake a
 spear upon sir tristram, and therewith sir dinadan dressed him to draw out
 his sword. not so, said sir tristram, why are ye so wroth? i will not
 fight. fie on thee, coward, said dinadan, thou shamest all knights. as for
 that, said sir tristram, i care not, for i will wait upon you and be under
 your protection; for because ye are so good a knight ye may save me. the
 devil deliver me of thee, said sir dinadan, for thou art as goodly a man
 of arms and of thy person as ever i saw, and the most coward that ever i
 saw. what wilt thou do with those great spears that thou carriest with
 thee? i shall give them, said sir tristram, to some good knight when i
 come to the tournament; and if i see you do best, i shall give them to
 you.
 so thus as they rode talking they saw where came an errant knight afore
 them, that dressed him to joust. lo, said sir tristram, yonder is one will
 joust; now dress thee to him. ah, shame betide thee, said sir dinadan.
 nay, not so, said tristram, for that knight beseemeth a shrew. then shall
 i, said sir dinadan. and so they dressed their shields and their spears,
 and they met together so hard that the other knight smote down sir dinadan
 from his horse. lo, said sir tristram, it had been better ye had left. fie
 on thee, coward, said sir dinadan. then sir dinadan started up and gat his
 sword in his hand, and proffered to do battle on foot. whether in love or
 in wrath? said the other knight. let us do battle in love, said sir
 dinadan. what is your name, said that knight, i pray you tell me. wit ye
 well my name is sir dinadan. ah, dinadan, said that knight, and my name is
 gareth, the youngest brother unto sir gawaine. then either made of other
 great cheer, for this gareth was the best knight of all the brethren, and
 he proved a good knight. then they took their horses, and there they spake
 of sir tristram, how such a coward he was; and every word sir tristram
 heard and laughed them to scorn.
 then were they ware where came a knight afore them well horsed and well
 armed, and he made him ready to joust. fair knights, said sir tristram,
 look betwixt you who shall joust with yonder knight, for i warn you i will
 not have ado with him. then shall i, said sir gareth. and so they
 encountered together, and there that knight smote down sir gareth over his
 horse's croup. how now, said sir tristram unto sir dinadan, dress thee now
 and revenge the good knight gareth. that shall i not, said sir dinadan,
 for he hath stricken down a much bigger knight than i am. ah, said sir
 tristram, now sir dinadan, i see and feel well your heart faileth you,
 therefore now shall ye see what i shall do. and then sir tristram hurtled
 unto that knight, and smote him quite from his horse. and when sir dinadan
 saw that, he marvelled greatly; and then he deemed that it was sir
 tristram.
 then this knight that was on foot pulled out his sword to do battle. what
 is your name? said sir tristram. wit ye well, said that knight, my name is
 sir palomides. what knight hate ye most? said sir tristram. sir knight,
 said he, i hate sir tristram to the death, for an i may meet with him the
 one of us shall die. ye say well, said sir tristram, and wit ye well that
 i am sir tristram de liones, and now do your worst. when sir palomides
 heard him say so he was astonied. and then he said thus: i pray you, sir
 tristram, forgive me all mine evil will, and if i live i shall do you
 service above all other knights that be living; and whereas i have owed
 you evil will me sore repenteth. i wot not what aileth me, for meseemeth
 that ye are a good knight, and none other knight that named himself a good
 knight should not hate you; therefore i require you, sir tristram, take no
 displeasure at mine unkind words. sir palomides, said sir tristram, ye say
 well, and well i wot ye are a good knight, for i have seen ye proved; and
 many great enterprises have ye taken upon you, and well achieved them;
 therefore, said sir tristram, an ye have any evil will to me, now may ye
 right it, for i am ready at your hand. not so, my lord sir tristram, i
 will do you knightly service in all thing as ye will command. and right so
 i will take you, said sir tristram. and so they rode forth on their ways
 talking of many things. o my lord sir tristram, said dinadan, foul have ye
 mocked me, for god knoweth i came into this country for your sake, and by
 the advice of my lord sir launcelot; and yet would not sir launcelot tell
 me the certainty of you, where i should find you. truly, said sir
 tristram, sir launcelot wist well where i was, for i abode within his own
 castle.
 chapter lviii. how they approached the castle lonazep, and of other
 devices of the death of sir lamorak.
 thus they rode until they were ware of the castle lonazep. and then were
 they ware of four hundred tents and pavilions, and marvellous great
 ordinance. so god me help, said sir tristram, yonder i see the greatest
 ordinance that ever i saw. sir, said palomides, meseemeth that there was
 as great an ordinance at the castle of maidens upon the rock, where ye won
 the prize, for i saw myself where ye forjousted thirty knights. sir, said
 dinadan, and in surluse, at that tournament that galahalt of the long
 isles made, the which there dured seven days, was as great a gathering as
 is here, for there were many nations. who was the best? said sir tristram.
 sir, it was sir launcelot du lake and the noble knight, sir lamorak de
 galis, and sir launcelot won the degree. i doubt not, said sir tristram,
 but he won the degree, so he had not been overmatched with many knights;
 and of the death of sir lamorak, said sir tristram, it was over great
 pity, for i dare say he was the cleanest mighted man and the best winded
 of his age that was alive; for i knew him that he was the biggest knight
 that ever i met withal, but if it were sir launcelot. alas, said sir
 tristram, full woe is me for his death. and if they were not the cousins
 of my lord arthur that slew him, they should die for it, and all those
 that were consenting to his death. and for such things, said sir tristram,
 i fear to draw unto the court of my lord arthur; i will that ye wit it,
 said sir tristram unto gareth.
 sir, i blame you not, said gareth, for well i understand the vengeance of
 my brethren sir gawaine, agravaine, gaheris, and mordred. but as for me,
 said sir gareth, i meddle not of their matters, therefore there is none of
 them that loveth me. and for i understand they be murderers of good
 knights i left their company; and god would i had been by, said gareth,
 when the noble knight, sir lamorak, was slain. now as jesu be my help,
 said sir tristram, it is well said of you, for i had liefer than all the
 gold betwixt this and rome i had been there. y-wis, () said palomides,
 and so would i had been there, and yet had i never the degree at no jousts
 nor tournament thereas he was, but he put me to the worse, or on foot or
 on horseback; and that day that he was slain he did the most deeds of arms
 that ever i saw knight do in all my life days. and when him was given the
 degree by my lord arthur, sir gawaine and his three brethren, agravaine,
 gaheris, and sir mordred, set upon sir lamorak in a privy place, and there
 they slew his horse. and so they fought with him on foot more than three
 hours, both before him and behind him; and sir mordred gave him his death
 wound behind him at his back, and all to-hew him: for one of his squires
 told me that saw it. fie upon treason, said sir tristram, for it killeth
 my heart to hear this tale. so it doth mine, said gareth; brethren as they
 be mine i shall never love them, nor draw in their fellowship for that
 deed.
 now speak we of other deeds, said palomides, and let him be, for his life
 ye may not get again. that is the more pity, said dinadan, for sir gawaine
 and his brethren, except you sir gareth, hate all the good knights of the
 round table for the most part; for well i wot an they might privily, they
 hate my lord sir launcelot and all his kin, and great privy despite they
 have at him; and that is my lord sir launcelot well ware of, and that
 causeth him to have the good knights of his kin about him.

 chapter lix. how they came to humber bank, and how they found a ship
 there, wherein lay the body of king hermance.
 sir, said palomides, let us leave of this matter, and let us see how we
 shall do at this tournament. by mine advice, said palomides, let us four
 hold together against all that will come. not by my counsel, said sir
 tristram, for i see by their pavilions there will be four hundred knights,
 and doubt ye not, said sir tristram, but there will be many good knights;
 and be a man never so valiant nor so big, yet he may be overmatched. and
 so have i seen knights done many times; and when they weened best to have
 won worship they lost it, for manhood is not worth but if it be medled
 with wisdom. and as for me, said sir tristram, it may happen i shall keep
 mine own head as well as another.
 so thus they rode until that they came to humber bank, where they heard a
 cry and a doleful noise. then were they ware in the wind where came a rich
 vessel hilled over with red silk, and the vessel landed fast by them.
 therewith sir tristram alighted and his knights. and so sir tristram went
 afore and entered into that vessel. and when he came within he saw a fair
 bed richly covered, and thereupon lay a dead seemly knight, all armed save
 the head, was all be-bled with deadly wounds upon him, the which seemed to
 be a passing good knight. how may this be, said sir tristram, that this
 knight is thus slain? then sir tristram was ware of a letter in the dead
 knight's hand. master mariners, said sir tristram, what meaneth that
 letter? sir, said they, in that letter ye shall hear and know how he was
 slain, and for what cause, and what was his name. but sir, said the
 mariners, wit ye well that no man shall take that letter and read it but
 if he be a good knight, and that he will faithfully promise to revenge his
 death, else shall there be no knight see that letter open. wit ye well,
 said sir tristram, that some of us may revenge his death as well as other,
 and if it be so as ye mariners say his death shall be revenged. and
 therewith sir tristram took the letter out of the knight's hand, and it
 said thus: hermance, king and lord of the red city, i send unto all
 knights errant, recommending unto you noble knights of arthur's court. i
 beseech them all among them to find one knight that will fight for my sake
 with two brethren that i brought up of nought, and feloniously and
 traitorly they have slain me; wherefore i beseech one good knight to
 revenge my death. and he that revengeth my death i will that he have my
 red city and all my castles.
 sir, said the mariners, wit ye well this king and knight that here lieth
 was a full worshipful man and of full great prowess, and full well he
 loved all manner knights errants. so god me help, said sir tristram, here
 is a piteous case, and full fain would i take this enterprise upon me; but
 i have made such a promise that needs i must be at this great tournament,
 or else i am shamed. for well i wot for my sake in especial my lord arthur
 let make this jousts and tournament in this country; and well i wot that
 many worshipful people will be there at that tournament for to see me;
 therefore i fear me to take this enterprise upon me that i shall not come
 again by time to this jousts. sir, said palomides, i pray you give me this
 enterprise, and ye shall see me achieve it worshipfully, other else i
 shall die in this quarrel. well, said sir tristram, and this enterprise i
 give you, with this, that ye be with me at this tournament that shall be
 as this day seven night. sir, said palomides, i promise you that i shall
 be with you by that day if i be unslain or unmaimed.
 chapter lx. how sir tristram with his fellowship came and were with an
 host which after fought with sir tristram; and other matters.
 then departed sir tristram, gareth, and sir dinadan, and left sir
 palomides in the vessel; and so sir tristram beheld the mariners how they
 sailed overlong humber. and when sir palomides was out of their sight they
 took their horses and beheld about them. and then were they ware of a
 knight that came riding against them unarmed, and nothing about him but a
 sword. and when this knight came nigh them he saluted them, and they him
 again. fair knights, said that knight, i pray you insomuch as ye be
 knights errant, that ye will come and see my castle, and take such as ye
 find there; i pray you heartily. and so they rode with him until his
 castle, and there they were brought into the hall, that was well
 apparelled; and so they were there unarmed, and set at a board; and when
 this knight saw sir tristram, anon he knew him. and then this knight waxed
 pale and wroth at sir tristram. when sir tristram saw his host make such
 cheer he marvelled and said: sir, mine host, what cheer make you? wit thou
 well, said he, i fare the worse for thee, for i know thee, sir tristram de
 liones, thou slewest my brother; and therefore i give thee summons i will
 slay thee an ever i may get thee at large. sir knight, said sir tristram,
 i am never advised that ever i slew any brother of yours; and if ye say
 that i did i will make amends unto my power. i will none amends, said the
 knight, but keep thee from me.
 so when he had dined sir tristram asked his arms, and departed. and so
 they rode on their ways, and within a while sir dinadan saw where came a
 knight well armed and well horsed, without shield. sir tristram, said sir
 dinadan, take keep to yourself, for i dare undertake yonder cometh your
 host that will have ado with you. let him come, said sir tristram, i shall
 abide him as well as i may. anon the knight, when he came nigh sir
 tristram, he cried and bade him abide and keep him. so they hurtled
 together, but sir tristram smote the other knight so sore that he bare him
 over his horse's croup. that knight arose lightly and took his horse
 again, and so rode fiercely to sir tristram, and smote him twice hard upon
 the helm. sir knight, said sir tristram, i pray you leave off and smite me
 no more, for i would be loath to deal with you an i might choose, for i
 have your meat and your drink within my body. for all that he would not
 leave; and then sir tristram gave him such a buffet upon the helm that he
 fell up-so-down from his horse, that the blood brast out at the ventails
 of his helm, and so he lay still likely to be dead. then sir tristram
 said: me repenteth of this buffet that i smote so sore, for as i suppose
 he is dead. and so they left him and rode on their ways.
 so they had not ridden but a while, but they saw riding against them two
 full likely knights, well armed and well horsed, and goodly servants about
 them. the one was berrant le apres, and he was called the king with the
 hundred knights; and the other was sir segwarides, which were renowned two
 noble knights. so as they came either by other the king looked upon sir
 dinadan, that at that time he had sir tristram's helm upon his shoulder,
 the which helm the king had seen to-fore with the queen of northgalis, and
 that queen the king loved as paramour; and that helm the queen of
 northgalis had given to la beale isoud, and the queen la beale isoud gave
 it to sir tristram. sir knight, said berrant, where had ye that helm? what
 would ye? said sir dinadan. for i will have ado with thee, said the king,
 for the love of her that owed that helm, and therefore keep you. so they
 departed and came together with all their mights of their horses, and
 there the king with the hundred knights smote sir dinadan, horse and all,
 to the earth; and then he commanded his servant: go and take thou his helm
 off, and keep it. so the varlet went to unbuckle his helm. what helm, what
 wilt thou do? said sir tristram, leave that helm. to what intent, said the
 king, will ye, sir knight, meddle with that helm? wit you well, said sir
 tristram, that helm shall not depart from me or it be dearer bought. then
 make you ready, said sir berrant unto sir tristram. so they hurtled
 together, and there sir tristram smote him down over his horse's tail; and
 then the king arose lightly, and gat his horse lightly again. and then he
 struck fiercely at sir tristram many great strokes. and then sir tristram
 gave sir berrant such a buffet upon the helm that he fell down over his
 horse sore stonied. lo, said dinadan, that helm is unhappy to us twain,
 for i had a fall for it, and now, sir king, have ye another fall.
 then segwarides asked: who shall joust with me? i pray thee, said sir
 gareth unto dinadan, let me have this jousts. sir, said dinadan, i pray
 you take it as for me. that is no reason, said tristram, for this jousts
 should be yours. at a word, said dinadan, i will not thereof. then gareth
 dressed him to sir segwarides, and there sir segwarides smote gareth and
 his horse to the earth. now, said sir tristram to dinadan, joust with
 yonder knight. i will not thereof, said dinadan. then will i, said sir
 tristram. and then sir tristram ran to him, and gave him a fall; and so
 they left them on foot, and sir tristram rode unto joyous gard, and there
 sir gareth would not of his courtesy have gone into this castle, but sir
 tristram would not suffer him to depart. and so they alighted and unarmed
 them, and had great cheer. but when dinadan came afore la beale isoud he
 cursed the time that ever he bare sir tristram's helm, and there he told
 her how sir tristram had mocked him. then was there laughing and japing at
 sir dinadan, that they wist not what to do with him.
 chapter lxi. how palomides went for to fight with two brethren for the
 death of king hermance.
 now will we leave them merry within joyous gard, and speak we of sir
 palomides. then sir palomides sailed evenlong humber to the coasts of the
 sea, where was a fair castle. and at that time it was early in the
 morning, afore day. then the mariners went unto sir palomides that slept
 fast. sir knight, said the mariners, ye must arise, for here is a castle
 there ye must go into. i assent me, said sir palomides; and therewithal he
 arrived. and then he blew his horn that the mariners had given him. and
 when they within the castle heard that horn they put forth many knights;
 and there they stood upon the walls, and said with one voice: welcome be
 ye to this castle. and then it waxed clear day, and sir palomides entered
 into the castle. and within a while he was served with many divers meats.
 then sir palomides heard about him much weeping and great dole. what may
 this mean? said sir palomides; i love not to hear such a sorrow, and fain
 i would know what it meaneth. then there came afore him one whose name was
 sir ebel, that said thus: wit ye well, sir knight, this dole and sorrow is
 here made every day, and for this cause: we had a king that hight
 hermance, and he was king of the red city, and this king that was lord was
 a noble knight, large and liberal of his expense; and in the world he
 loved nothing so much as he did errant knights of king arthur's court, and
 all jousting, hunting, and all manner of knightly games; for so kind a
 king and knight had never the rule of poor people as he was; and because
 of his goodness and gentle ness we bemoan him, and ever shall. and all
 kings and estates may beware by our lord, for he was destroyed in his own
 default; for had he cherished them of his blood he had yet lived with
 great riches and rest: but all estates may beware by our king. but alas,
 said ebel, that we shall give all other warning by his death.
 tell me, said palomides, and in what manner was your lord slain, and by
 whom. sir, said sir ebel, our king brought up of children two men that now
 are perilous knights; and these two knights our king had so in charity,
 that he loved no man nor trusted no man of his blood, nor none other that
 was about him. and by these two knights our king was governed, and so they
 ruled him peaceably and his lands, and never would they suffer none of his
 blood to have no rule with our king. and also he was so free and so
 gentle, and they so false and deceivable, that they ruled him peaceably;
 and that espied the lords of our king's blood, and departed from him unto
 their own livelihood. then when these two traitors understood that they
 had driven all the lords of his blood from him, they were not pleased with
 that rule, but then they thought to have more, as ever it is an old saw:
 give a churl rule and thereby he will not be sufficed; for whatsomever he
 be that is ruled by a villain born, and the lord of the soil to be a
 gentleman born, the same villain shall destroy all the gentlemen about
 him: therefore all estates and lords, beware whom ye take about you. and
 if ye be a knight of king arthur's court remember this tale, for this is
 the end and conclusion. my lord and king rode unto the forest hereby by
 the advice of these traitors, and there he chased at the red deer, armed
 at all pieces full like a good knight; and so for labour he waxed dry, and
 then he alighted, and drank at a well. and when he was alighted, by the
 assent of these two traitors, that one that hight helius he suddenly smote
 our king through the body with a spear, and so they left him there. and
 when they were departed, then by fortune i came to the well, and found my
 lord and king wounded to the death. and when i heard his complaint, i let
 bring him to the water side, and in that same ship i put him alive; and
 when my lord king hermance was in that vessel, he required me for the true
 faith i owed unto him for to write a letter in this manner.
 chapter lxii. the copy of the letter written for to revenge the king's
 death, and how sir palomides fought for to have the battle.
 recommending unto king arthur and to all his knights errant, beseeching
 them all that insomuch as i, king hermance, king of the red city, thus am
 slain by felony and treason, through two knights of mine own, and of mine
 own bringing up and of mine own making, that some worshipful knight will
 revenge my death, insomuch i have been ever to my power well willing unto
 arthur's court. and who that will adventure his life with these two
 traitors for my sake in one battle, i, king hermance, king of the red
 city, freely give him all my lands and rents that ever i wielded in my
 life. this letter, said ebel, i wrote by my lord's commandment, and then
 he received his creator; and when he was dead, he commanded me or ever he
 were cold to put that letter fast in his hand. and then he commanded me to
 put forth that same vessel down humber, and i should give these mariners
 in commandment never to stint until that they came unto logris, where all
 the noble knights shall assemble at this time. and there shall some good
 knight have pity on me to revenge my death, for there was never king nor
 lord falslier nor traitorlier slain than i am here to my death. thus was
 the complaint of our king hermance. now, said sir ebel, ye know all how
 our lord was betrayed, we require you for god's sake have pity upon his
 death, and worshipfully revenge his death, and then may ye wield all these
 lands. for we all wit well that an ye may slay these two traitors, the red
 city and all those that be therein will take you for their lord.
 truly, said sir palomides, it grieveth my heart for to hear you tell this
 doleful tale; and to say the truth i saw the same letter that ye speak of,
 and one of the best knights on the earth read that letter to me, and by
 his commandment i came hither to revenge your king's death; and therefore
 have done, and let me wit where i shall find those traitors, for i shall
 never be at ease in my heart till i be in hands with them. sir, said sir
 ebel, then take your ship again, and that ship must bring you unto the
 delectable isle, fast by the red city, and we in this castle shall pray
 for you, and abide your again-coming. for this same castle, an ye speed
 well, must needs be yours; for our king hermance let make this castle for
 the love of the two traitors, and so we kept it with strong hand, and
 therefore full sore are we threated. wot ye what ye shall do, said sir
 palomides; whatsomever come of me, look ye keep well this castle. for an
 it misfortune me so to be slain in this quest i am sure there will come
 one of the best knights of the world for to revenge my death, and that is
 sir tristram de liones, or else sir launcelot du lake.
 then sir palomides departed from that castle. and as he came nigh the
 city, there came out of a ship a goodly knight armed against him, with his
 shield on his shoulder, and his hand upon his sword. and anon as he came
 nigh sir palomides he said: sir knight, what seek ye here? leave this
 quest for it is mine, and mine it was or ever it was yours, and therefore
 i will have it. sir knight, said palomides, it may well be that this quest
 was yours or it was mine, but when the letter was taken out of the dead
 king's hand, at that time by likelihood there was no knight had undertaken
 to revenge the death of the king. and so at that time i promised to
 revenge his death, and so i shall or else i am ashamed. ye say well, said
 the knight, but wit ye well then will i fight with you, and who be the
 better knight of us both, let him take the battle upon hand. i assent me,
 said sir palomides. and then they dressed their shields, and pulled out
 their swords, and lashed together many sad strokes as men of might; and
 this fighting was more than an hour, but at the last sir palomides waxed
 big and better winded, so that then he smote that knight such a stroke
 that he made him to kneel upon his knees. then that knight spake on high
 and said: gentle knight, hold thy hand. sir palomides was goodly and
 withdrew his hand. then this knight said: wit ye well, knight, that thou
 art better worthy to have this battle than i, and require thee of
 knighthood tell me thy name. sir, my name is palomides, a knight of king
 arthur's, and of the table round, that hither i came to revenge the death
 of this dead king.
 chapter lxiii. of the preparation of sir palomides and the two brethren
 that should fight with him.
 well be ye found, said the knight to palomides, for of all knights that be
 alive, except three, i had liefest have you. the first is sir launcelot du
 lake, and sir tristram de liones, the third is my nigh cousin, sir lamorak
 de galis. and i am brother unto king hermance that is dead, and my name is
 sir hermind. ye say well, said sir palomides, and ye shall see how i shall
 speed; and if i be there slain go ye to my lord sir launcelot, or else to
 my lord sir tristram, and pray them to revenge my death, for as for sir
 lamorak him shall ye never see in this world. alas, said sir hermind, how
 may that be? he is slain, said sir palomides, by sir gawaine and his
 brethren. so god me help, said hermind, there was not one for one that
 slew him. that is truth, said sir palomides, for they were four dangerous
 knights that slew him, as sir gawaine, sir agravaine, sir gaheris, and sir
 mordred, but sir gareth, the fifth brother was away, the best knight of
 them all. and so sir palomides told hermind all the manner, and how they
 slew sir lamorak all only by treason.
 so sir palomides took his ship, and arrived up at the delectable isle. and
 in the meanwhile sir hermind that was the king's brother, he arrived up at
 the red city, and there he told them how there was come a knight of king
 arthur's to avenge king hermance's death: and his name is sir palomides,
 the good knight, that for the most part he followeth the beast glatisant.
 then all the city made great joy, for mickle had they heard of sir
 palomides, and of his noble prowess. so let they ordain a messenger, and
 sent unto the two brethren, and bade them to make them ready, for there
 was a knight come that would fight with them both. so the messenger went
 unto them where they were at a castle there beside; and there he told them
 how there was a knight come of king arthur's court to fight with them both
 at once. he is welcome, said they; but tell us, we pray you, if it be sir
 launcelot or any of his blood? he is none of that blood, said the
 messenger. then we care the less, said the two brethren, for with none of
 the blood of sir launcelot we keep not to have ado withal. wit ye well,
 said the messenger, that his name is sir palomides, that yet is
 unchristened, a noble knight. well, said they, an he be now unchristened
 he shall never be christened. so they appointed to be at the city within
 two days.
 and when sir palomides was come to the city they made passing great joy of
 him, and then they beheld him, and saw that he was well made, cleanly and
 bigly, and unmaimed of his limbs, and neither too young nor too old. and
 so all the people praised him; and though he was not christened yet he
 believed in the best manner, and was full faithful and true of his
 promise, and well conditioned; and because he made his avow that he would
 never be christened unto the time that he had achieved the beast
 glatisant, the which was a full wonderful beast, and a great
 signification; for merlin prophesied much of that beast. and also sir
 palomides avowed never to take full christendom unto the time that he had
 done seven battles within the lists.
 so within the third day there came to the city these two brethren, the one
 hight helius, the other hight helake, the which were men of great prowess;
 howbeit that they were false and full of treason, and but poor men born,
 yet were they noble knights of their hands. and with them they brought
 forty knights, to that intent that they should be big enough for the red
 city. thus came the two brethren with great bobaunce and pride, for they
 had put the red city in fear and damage. then they were brought to the
 lists, and sir palomides came into the place and said thus: be ye the two
 brethren, helius and helake, that slew your king and lord, sir hermance,
 by felony and treason, for whom that i am come hither to revenge his
 death? wit thou well, said sir helius and sir helake, that we are the same
 knights that slew king hermance; and wit thou well, sir palomides saracen,
 that we shall handle thee so or thou depart that thou shalt wish that thou
 wert christened. it may well be, said sir palomides, for yet i would not
 die or i were christened; and yet so am i not afeard of you both, but i
 trust to god that i shall die a better christian man than any of you both;
 and doubt ye not, said sir palomides, either ye or i shall be left dead in
 this place.
 chapter lxiv. of the battle between sir palomides and the two brethren,
 and how the two brethren were slain.
 then they departed, and the two brethren came against sir palomides, and
 he against them, as fast as their horses might run. and by fortune sir
 palomides smote helake through his shield and through the breast more than
 a fathom. all this while sir helius held up his spear, and for pride and
 orgulité he would not smite sir palomides with his spear; but when he saw
 his brother lie on the earth, and saw he might not help himself, then he
 said unto sir palomides: help thyself. and therewith he came hurtling unto
 sir palomides with his spear, and smote him quite from his saddle. then
 sir helius rode over sir palomides twice or thrice. and therewith sir
 palomides was ashamed, and gat the horse of sir helius by the bridle, and
 therewithal the horse areared, and sir palomides halp after, and so they
 fell both to the earth; but anon sir helius stert up lightly, and there he
 smote sir palomides a great stroke upon the helm, that he kneeled upon his
 own knee. then they lashed together many sad strokes, and traced and
 traversed now backward, now sideling, hurtling together like two boars,
 and that same time they fell both grovelling to the earth.
 thus they fought still without any reposing two hours, and never breathed;
 and then sir palomides waxed faint and weary, and sir helius waxed passing
 strong, and doubled his strokes, and drove sir palomides overthwart and
 endlong all the field, that they of the city when they saw sir palomides
 in this case they wept and cried, and made great dole, and the other party
 made as great joy. alas, said the men of the city, that this noble knight
 should thus be slain for our king's sake. and as they were thus weeping
 and crying, sir palomides that had suffered an hundred strokes, that it
 was wonder that he stood on his feet, at the last sir palomides beheld as
 he might the common people, how they wept for him; and then he said to
 himself: ah, fie for shame, sir palomides, why hangest thou thy head so
 low; and therewith he bare up his shield, and looked sir helius in the
 visage, and he smote him a great stroke upon the helm, and after that
 another and another. and then he smote sir helius with such a might that
 he fell to the earth grovelling; and then he raced off his helm from his
 head, and there he smote him such a buffet that he departed his head from
 the body. and then were the people of the city the joyfullest people that
 might be. so they brought him to his lodging with great solemnity, and
 there all the people became his men. and then sir palomides prayed them
 all to take keep unto all the lordship of king hermance: for, fair sirs,
 wit ye well i may not as at this time abide with you, for i must in all
 haste be with my lord king arthur at the castle of lonazep, the which i
 have promised. then was the people full heavy at his departing, for all
 that city proffered sir palomides the third part of their goods so that he
 would abide with them; but in no wise as at that time he would not abide.
 and so sir palomides departed, and so he came unto the castle thereas sir
 ebel was lieutenant. and when they in the castle wist how sir palomides
 had sped, there was a joyful meiny; and so sir palomides departed, and
 came to the castle of lonazep. and when he wist that sir tristram was not
 there he took his way over humber, and came unto joyous gard, whereas sir
 tristram was and la beale isoud. sir tristram had commanded that what
 knight errant came within the joyous gard, as in the town, that they
 should warn sir tristram. so there came a man of the town, and told sir
 tristram how there was a knight in the town, a passing goodly man. what
 manner of man is he, said sir tristram, and what sign beareth he? so the
 man told sir tristram all the tokens of him. that is palomides, said
 dinadan. it may well be, said sir tristram. go ye to him, said sir
 tristram unto dinadan. so dinadan went unto sir palomides, and there
 either made other great joy, and so they lay together that night. and on
 the morn early came sir tristram and sir gareth, and took them in their
 beds, and so they arose and brake their fast.
 chapter lxv. how sir tristram and sir palomides met breuse saunce pité,
 and how sir tristram and la beale isoud went unto lonazep.
 and then sir tristram desired sir palomides to ride into the fields and
 woods. so they were accorded to repose them in the forest. and when they
 had played them a great while they rode unto a fair well; and anon they
 were ware of an armed knight that came riding against them, and there
 either saluted other. then this armed knight spake to sir tristram, and
 asked what were these knights that were lodged in joyous gard. i wot not
 what they are, said sir tristram. what knights be ye? said that knight,
 for meseemeth ye be no knights errant, because ye ride unarmed. whether we
 be knights or not we list not to tell thee our name. wilt thou not tell me
 thy name? said that knight; then keep thee, for thou shalt die of my
 hands. and therewith he got his spear in his hands, and would have run sir
 tristram through. that saw sir palomides, and smote his horse traverse in
 midst of the side, that man and horse fell to the earth. and therewith sir
 palomides alighted and pulled out his sword to have slain him. let be,
 said sir tristram, slay him not, the knight is but a fool, it were shame
 to slay him. but take away his spear, said sir tristram, and let him take
 his horse and go where that he will.
 so when this knight arose he groaned sore of the fall, and so he took his
 horse, and when he was up he turned then his horse, and required sir
 tristram and sir palomides to tell him what knights they were. now wit ye
 well, said sir tristram, that my name is sir tristram de liones, and this
 knight's name is sir palomides. when he wist what they were he took his
 horse with the spurs, because they should not ask him his name, and so
 rode fast away through thick and thin. then came there by them a knight
 with a bended shield of azure, whose name was epinogris, and he came
 toward them a great wallop. whither are ye riding? said sir tristram. my
 fair lords, said epinogris, i follow the falsest knight that beareth the
 life; wherefore i require you tell me whether ye saw him, for he beareth a
 shield with a case of red over it. so god me help, said tristram, such a
 knight departed from us not a quarter of an hour agone; we pray you tell
 us his name. alas, said epinogris, why let ye him escape from you? and he
 is so great a foe unto all errant knights: his name is breuse saunce pité.
 ah, fie for shame, said sir palomides, alas that ever he escaped mine
 hands, for he is the man in the world that i hate most. then every knight
 made great sorrow to other; and so epinogris departed and followed the
 chase after him.
 then sir tristram and his three fellows rode unto joyous gard; and there
 sir tristram talked unto sir palomides of his battle, how he sped at the
 red city, and as ye have heard afore so was it ended. truly, said sir
 tristram, i am glad ye have well sped, for ye have done worshipfully.
 well, said sir tristram, we must forward to-morn. and then he devised how
 it should be; and sir tristram devised to send his two pavilions to set
 them fast by the well of lonazep, and therein shall be the queen la beale
 isoud. it is well said, said sir dinadan, but when sir palomides heard of
 that his heart was ravished out of measure: notwithstanding he said but
 little. so when they came to joyous gard sir palomides would not have gone
 into the castle, but as sir tristram took him by the finger, and led him
 into the castle. and when sir palomides saw la beale isoud he was ravished
 so that he might unnethe speak. so they went unto meat, but palomides
 might not eat, and there was all the cheer that might be had. and on the
 morn they were apparelled to ride toward lonazep.
 so sir tristram had three squires, and la beale isoud had three
 gentlewomen, and both the queen and they were richly apparelled; and other
 people had they none with them, but varlets to bear their shields and
 their spears. and thus they rode forth. so as they rode they saw afore
 them a rout of knights; it was the knight galihodin with twenty knights
 with him. fair fellows, said galihodin, yonder come four knights, and a
 rich and a well fair lady: i am in will to take that lady from them. that
 is not of the best counsel, said one of galihodin's men, but send ye to
 them and wit what they will say; and so it was done. there came a squire
 unto sir tristram, and asked them whether they would joust or else to lose
 their lady. not so, said sir tristram, tell your lord i bid him come as
 many as we be, and win her and take her. sir, said palomides, an it please
 you let me have this deed, and i shall undertake them all four. i will
 that ye have it, said sir tristram, at your pleasure. now go and tell your
 lord galihodin, that this same knight will encounter with him and his
 fellows.
 chapter lxvi. how sir palomides jousted with sir galihodin, and after with
 sir gawaine, and smote them down.
 then this squire departed and told galihodin; and then he dressed his
 shield, and put forth a spear, and sir palomides another; and there sir
 palomides smote galihodin so hard that he smote both horse and man to the
 earth. and there he had an horrible fall. and then came there another
 knight, and in the same wise he served him; and so he served the third and
 the fourth, that he smote them over their horses' croups, and always sir
 palomides' spear was whole. then came six knights more of galihodin's men,
 and would have been avenged upon sir palomides. let be, said sir
 galihodin, not so hardy, none of you all meddle with this knight, for he
 is a man of great bounté and honour, and if he would ye were not able to
 meddle with him. and right so they held them still. and ever sir palomides
 was ready to joust; and when he saw they would no more he rode unto sir
 tristram. right well have ye done, said sir tristram, and worshipfully
 have ye done as a good knight should. this galihodin was nigh cousin unto
 galahalt, the haut prince; and this galihodin was a king within the
 country of surluse.
 so as sir tristram, sir palomides, and la beale isoud rode together they
 saw afore them four knights, and every man had his spear in his hand: the
 first was sir gawaine, the second sir uwaine, the third sir sagramore le
 desirous, and the fourth was dodinas le savage. when sir palomides beheld
 them, that the four knights were ready to joust, he prayed sir tristram to
 give him leave to have ado with them all so long as he might hold him on
 horseback. and if that i be smitten down i pray you revenge me. well, said
 sir tristram, i will as ye will, and ye are not so fain to have worship
 but i would as fain increase your worship. and therewithal sir gawaine put
 forth his spear, and sir palomides another; and so they came so eagerly
 together that sir palomides smote sir gawaine to the earth, horse and all;
 and in the same wise he served uwaine, sir dodinas, and sagramore. all
 these four knights sir palomides smote down with divers spears and then
 sir tristram departed toward lonazep.
 and when they were departed then came thither galihodin with his ten
 knights unto sir gawaine, and there he told him all how he had sped. i
 marvel, said sir gawaine, what knights they be, that are so arrayed in
 green. and that knight upon the white horse smote me down, said galihodin,
 and my three fellows. and so he did to me, said gawaine; and well i wot,
 said sir gawaine, that either he upon the white horse is sir tristram or
 else sir palomides, and that gay beseen lady is queen isoud. thus they
 talked of one thing and of other.
 and in the meanwhile sir tristram passed on till that he came to the well
 where his two pavilions were set; and there they alighted, and there they
 saw many pavilions and great array. then sir tristram left there sir
 palomides and sir gareth with la beale isoud, and sir tristram and sir
 dinadan rode to lonazep to hearken tidings; and sir tristram rode upon sir
 palomides' white horse. and when he came into the castle sir dinadan heard
 a great horn blow, and to the horn drew many knights. then sir tristram
 asked a knight: what meaneth the blast of that horn? sir, said that
 knight, it is all those that shall hold against king arthur at this
 tournament. the first is the king of ireland, and the king of surluse, the
 king of listinoise, the king of northumberland, and the king of the best
 part of wales, with many other countries. and these draw them to a
 council, to understand what governance they shall be of; but the king of
 ireland, whose name was marhalt, and father to the good knight sir marhaus
 that sir tristram slew, had all the speech that sir tristram might hear
 it. he said: lords and fellows, let us look to ourself, for wit ye well
 king arthur is sure of many good knights, or else he would not with so few
 knights have ado with us; therefore by my counsel let every king have a
 standard and a cognisance by himself, that every knight draw to their
 natural lord, and then may every king and captain help his knights if they
 have need. when sir tristram had heard all their counsel he rode unto king
 arthur for to hear of his counsel.
 chapter lxvii. how sir tristram and his fellowship came into the
 tournament of lonazep; and of divers jousts and matters.
 but sir tristram was not so soon come into the place, but sir gawaine and
 sir galihodin went to king arthur, and told him: that same green knight in
 the green harness with the white horse smote us two down, and six of our
 fellows this same day. well, said arthur. and then he called sir tristram
 and asked him what was his name. sir, said sir tristram, ye shall hold me
 excused as at this time, for ye shall not wit my name. and there sir
 tristram returned and rode his way. i have marvel, said arthur, that
 yonder knight will not tell me his name, but go thou, griflet le fise de
 dieu, and pray him to speak with me betwixt us. then sir griflet rode
 after him and overtook him, and said him that king arthur prayed him for
 to speak with him secretly apart. upon this covenant, said sir tristram, i
 will speak with him; that i will turn again so that ye will ensure me not
 to desire to hear my name. i shall undertake, said sir griflet, that he
 will not greatly desire it of you. so they rode together until they came
 to king arthur. fair sir, said king arthur, what is the cause ye will not
 tell me your name? sir, said sir tristram, without a cause i will not hide
 my name. upon what party will ye hold? said king arthur. truly, my lord,
 said sir tristram, i wot not yet on what party i will be on, until i come
 to the field, and there as my heart giveth me, there will i hold; but
 to-morrow ye shall see and prove on what party i shall come. and
 therewithal he returned and went to his pavilions.
 and upon the morn they armed them all in green, and came into the field;
 and there young knights began to joust, and did many worshipful deeds.
 then spake gareth unto sir tristram, and prayed him to give him leave to
 break his spear, for him thought shame to bear his spear whole again. when
 sir tristram heard him say so he laughed, and said: i pray you do your
 best. then sir gareth gat a spear and proffered to joust. that saw a
 knight that was nephew unto the king of the hundred knights; his name was
 selises, and a good man of arms. so this knight selises then dressed him
 unto sir gareth, and they two met together so hard that either smote other
 down, his horse and all, to the earth, so they were both bruised and hurt;
 and there they lay till the king with the hundred knights halp selises up,
 and sir tristram and sir palomides halp up gareth again. and so they rode
 with sir gareth unto their pavilions, and then they pulled off his helm.
 and when la beale isoud saw sir gareth bruised in the face she asked him
 what ailed him. madam, said sir gareth, i had a great buffet, and as i
 suppose i gave another, but none of my fellows, god thank them, would not
 rescue me. forsooth, said palomides, it longed not to none of us as this
 day to joust, for there have not this day jousted no proved knights, and
 needly ye would joust. and when the other party saw ye proffered yourself
 to joust they sent one to you, a passing good knight of his age, for i
 know him well, his name is selises; and worshipfully ye met with him, and
 neither of you are dishonoured, and therefore refresh yourself that ye may
 be ready and whole to joust to-morrow. as for that, said gareth, i shall
 not fail you an i may bestride mine horse.
 chapter lxviii. how sir tristram and his fellowship jousted, and of the
 noble feats that they did in that tourneying.
 now upon what party, said tristram, is it best we be withal as to-morn?
 sir, said palomides, ye shall have mine advice to be against king arthur
 as to-morn, for on his party will be sir launcelot and many good knights
 of his blood with him. and the more men of worship that they be, the more
 worship we shall win. that is full knightly spoken, said sir tristram; and
 right so as ye counsel me, so will we do. in the name of god, said they
 all. so that night they were lodged with the best. and on the morn when it
 was day they were arrayed all in green trappings, shields and spears, and
 la beale isoud in the same colour, and her three damosels. and right so
 these four knights came into the field endlong and through. and so they
 led la beale isoud thither as she should stand and behold all the jousts
 in a bay window; but always she was wimpled that no man might see her
 visage. and then these three knights rode straight unto the party of the
 king of scots.
 when king arthur had seen them do all this he asked sir launcelot what
 were these knights and that queen. sir, said launcelot, i cannot say you
 in certain, but if sir tristram be in this country, or sir palomides, wit
 ye well it be they m certain, and la beale isoud. then arthur called to
 him sir kay and said: go lightly and wit how many knights there be here
 lacking of the table round, for by the sieges thou mayst know. so went sir
 kay and saw by the writings in the sieges that there lacked ten knights.
 and these be their names that be not here. sir tristram, sir palomides,
 sir percivale, sir gaheris, sir epinogris, sir mordred, sir dinadan, sir
 la cote male taile, and sir pelleas the noble knight. well, said arthur,
 some of these i dare undertake are here this day against us.
 then came therein two brethren, cousins unto sir gawaine, the one hight
 sir edward, that other hight sir sadok, the which were two good knights;
 and they asked of king arthur that they might have the first jousts, for
 they were of orkney. i am pleased, said king arthur. then sir edward
 encountered with the king of scots, in whose party was sir tristram and
 sir palomides; and sir edward smote the king of scots quite from his
 horse, and sir sadok smote down the king of north wales, and gave him a
 wonder great fall, that there was a great cry on king arthur's party, and
 that made sir palomides passing wroth. and so sir palomides dressed his
 shield and his spear, and with all his might he met with sir edward of
 orkney, that he smote him so hard that his horse might not stand on his
 feet, and so they hurtled to the earth; and then with the same spear sir
 palomides smote down sir sadok over his horse's croup. o jesu, said
 arthur, what knight is that arrayed all in green? he jousteth mightily.
 wit you well, said sir gawaine, he is a good knight, and yet shall ye see
 him joust better or he depart. and yet shall ye see, said sir gawaine,
 another bigger knight, in the same colour, than he is; for that same
 knight, said sir gawaine, that smote down right now my four cousins, he
 smote me down within these two days, and seven fellows more.
 this meanwhile as they stood thus talking there came into the place sir
 tristram upon a black horse, and or ever he stint he smote down with one
 spear four good knights of orkney that were of the kin of sir gawaine; and
 sir gareth and sir dinadan everych of them smote down a good knight. jesu,
 said arthur, yonder knight upon the black horse doth mightily and
 marvellously well. abide you, said sir gawaine; that knight with the black
 horse began not yet. then sir tristram made to horse again the two kings
 that edward and sadok had unhorsed at the beginning. and then sir tristram
 drew his sword and rode into the thickest of the press against them of
 orkney; and there he smote down knights, and rashed off helms, and pulled
 away their shields, and hurtled down many knights: he fared so that sir
 arthur and all knights had great marvel when they saw one knight do so
 great deeds of arms. and sir palomides failed not upon the other side, but
 did so marvellously well that all men had wonder. for there king arthur
 likened sir tristram that was on the black horse like to a wood lion, and
 likened sir palomides upon the white horse unto a wood leopard, and sir
 gareth and sir dinadan unto eager wolves. but the custom was such among
 them that none of the kings would help other, but all the fellowship of
 every standard to help other as they might; but ever sir tristram did so
 much deeds of arms that they of orkney waxed weary of him, and so withdrew
 them unto lonazep
 chapter lxix. how sir tristram was unhorsed and smitten down by sir
 launcelot, and after that sir tristram smote down king arthur.
 then was the cry of heralds and all manner of common people: the green
 knight hath done marvellously, and beaten all them of orkney. and there
 the heralds numbered that sir tristram that sat upon the black horse had
 smitten down with spears and swords thirty knights; and sir palomides had
 smitten down twenty knights, and the most part of these fifty knights were
 of the house of king arthur, and proved knights. so god me help, said
 arthur unto sir launcelot, this is a great shame to us to see four knights
 beat so many knights of mine; and therefore make you ready, for we will
 have ado with them. sir, said launcelot, wit ye well that there are two
 passing good knights, and great worship were it not to us now to have ado
 with them, for they have this day sore travailed. as for that, said
 arthur, i will be avenged; and therefore take with you sir bleoberis and
 sir ector, and i will be the fourth, said arthur. sir, said launcelot, ye
 shall find me ready, and my brother sir ector, and my cousin sir
 bleoberis. and so when they were ready and on horseback: now choose, said
 sir arthur unto sir launcelot, with whom that ye will encounter withal.
 sir, said launcelot, i will meet with the green knight upon the black
 horse, that was sir tristram; and my cousin sir bleoberis shall match the
 green knight upon the white horse, that was sir palomides; and my brother
 sir ector shall match with the green knight upon the white horse, that was
 sir gareth. then must i, said sir arthur, have ado with the green knight
 upon the grisled horse, and that was sir dinadan. now every man take heed
 to his fellow, said sir launcelot. and so they trotted on together, and
 there encountered sir launcelot against sir tristram. so sir launcelot
 smote sir tristram so sore upon the shield that he bare horse and man to
 the earth; but sir launcelot weened that it had been sir palomides, and so
 he passed forth. and then sir bleoberis encountered with sir palomides,
 and he smote him so hard upon the shield that sir palomides and his white
 horse rustled to the earth. then sir ector de maris smote sir gareth so
 hard that down he fell off his horse. and the noble king arthur
 encountered with sir dinadan, and he smote him quite from his saddle. and
 then the noise turned awhile how the green knights were slain down.
 when the king of northgalis saw that sir tristram had a fall, then he
 remembered him how great deeds of arms sir tristram had done. then he made
 ready many knights, for the custom and cry was such, that what knight were
 smitten down, and might not be horsed again by his fellows, outher by his
 own strength, that as that day he should be prisoner unto the party that
 had smitten him down. so came in the king of northgalis, and he rode
 straight unto sir tristram; and when he came nigh him he alighted down
 suddenly and betook sir tristram his horse, and said thus: noble knight, i
 know thee not of what country that thou art, but for the noble deeds that
 thou hast done this day take there my horse, and let me do as well i may;
 for, as jesu me help, thou art better worthy to have mine horse than i
 myself. gramercy, said sir tristram, and if i may i shall quite you: look
 that ye go not far from us, and as i suppose, i shall win you another
 horse. and therewith sir tristram mounted upon his horse, and there he met
 with king arthur, and he gave him such a buffet upon the helm with his
 sword that king arthur had no power to keep his saddle. and then sir
 tristram gave the king of northgalis king arthur's horse: then was there
 great press about king arthur for to horse him again; but sir palomides
 would not suffer king arthur to be horsed again, but ever sir palomides
 smote on the right hand and on the left hand mightily as a noble knight.
 and this meanwhile sir tristram rode through the thickest of the press,
 and smote down knights on the right hand and on the left hand, and raced
 off helms, and so passed forth unto his pavilions, and left sir palomides
 on foot; and sir tristram changed his horse and disguised himself all in
 red, horse and harness.
 chapter lxx. how sir tristram changed his harness and it was all red, and
 how he demeaned him, and how sir palomides slew launcelot's horse.
 and when the queen la beale isoud saw that sir tristram was unhorsed, and
 she wist not where he was, then she wept greatly. but sir tristram, when
 he was ready, came dashing lightly into the field, and then la beale isoud
 espied him. and so he did great deeds of arms; with one spear, that was
 great, sir tristram smote down five knights or ever he stint. then sir
 launcelot espied him readily, that it was sir tristram, and then he
 repented him that he had smitten him down; and so sir launcelot went out
 of the press to repose him and lightly he came again. and now when sir
 tristram came into the press, through his great force he put sir palomides
 upon his horse, and sir gareth, and sir dinadan, and then they began to do
 marvellously; but sir palomides nor none of his two fellows knew not who
 had holpen them on horseback again. but ever sir tristram was nigh them
 and succoured them, and they [knew] not him, because he was changed into
 red armour: and all this while sir launcelot was away.
 so when la beale isoud knew sir tristram again upon his horse-back she was
 passing glad, and then she laughed and made good cheer. and as it
 happened, sir palomides looked up toward her where she lay in the window,
 and he espied how she laughed; and therewith he took such a rejoicing that
 he smote down, what with his spear and with his sword, all that ever he
 met; for through the sight of her he was so enamoured in her love that he
 seemed at that time, that an both sir tristram and sir launcelot had been
 both against him they should have won no worship of him; and in his heart,
 as the book saith, sir palomides wished that with his worship he might
 have ado with sir tristram before all men, because of la beale isoud. then
 sir palomides began to double his strength, and he did so marvellously
 that all men had wonder of him, and ever he cast up his eye unto la beale
 isoud. and when he saw her make such cheer he fared like a lion, that
 there might no man withstand him; and then sir tristram beheld him, how
 that sir palomides bestirred him; and then he said unto sir dinadan: so
 god me help, sir palomides is a passing good knight and a well enduring,
 but such deeds saw i him never do, nor never heard i tell that ever he did
 so much in one day. it is his day, said dinadan; and he would say no more
 unto sir tristram; but to himself he said: an if ye knew for whose love he
 doth all those deeds of arms, soon would sir tristram abate his courage.
 alas, said sir tristram, that sir palomides is not christened. so said
 king arthur, and so said all those that beheld him. then all people gave
 him the prize, as for the best knight that day, that he passed sir
 launcelot outher sir tristram. well, said dinadan to himself, all this
 worship that sir palomides hath here this day he may thank the queen
 isoud, for had she been away this day sir palomides had not gotten the
 prize this day.
 right so came into the field sir launcelot du lake, and saw and heard the
 noise and cry and the great worship that sir palomides had. he dressed him
 against sir palomides, with a great mighty spear and a long, and thought
 to smite him down. and when sir palomides saw sir launcelot come upon him
 so fast, he ran upon sir launcelot as fast with his sword as he might; and
 as sir launcelot should have stricken him he smote his spear aside, and
 smote it a-two with his sword. and sir palomides rushed unto sir
 launcelot, and thought to have put him to a shame; and with his sword he
 smote his horse's neck that sir launcelot rode upon, and then sir
 launcelot fell to the earth. then was the cry huge and great: see how sir
 palomides the saracen hath smitten down sir launcelot's horse. right then
 were there many knights wroth with sir palomides because he had done that
 deed; therefore many knights held there against that it was unknightly
 done in a tournament to kill an horse wilfully, but that it had been done
 in plain battle, life for life.
 chapter lxxi. how sir launcelot said to sir palomides, and how the prize
 of that day was given unto sir palomides.
 when sir ector de maris saw sir launcelot his brother have such a despite,
 and so set on foot, then he gat a spear eagerly, and ran against sir
 palomides, and he smote him so hard that he bare him quite from his horse.
 that saw sir tristram, that was in red harness, and he smote down sir
 ector de maris quite from his horse. then sir launcelot dressed his shield
 upon his shoulder, and with his sword naked in his hand, and so came
 straight upon sir palomides fiercely and said: wit thou well thou hast
 done me this day the greatest despite that ever any worshipful knight did
 to me in tournament or in jousts, and therefore i will be avenged upon
 thee, therefore take keep to yourself. ah, mercy, noble knight, said
 palomides, and forgive me mine unkindly deeds, for i have no power nor
 might to withstand you, and i have done so much this day that well i wot i
 did never so much, nor never shall in my life-days; and therefore, most
 noble knight, i require thee spare me as at this day, and i promise you i
 shall ever be your knight while i live: an ye put me from my worship now,
 ye put me from the greatest worship that ever i had or ever shall have in
 my life-days. well, said sir launcelot, i see, for to say thee sooth, ye
 have done marvellously well this day; and i understand a part for whose
 love ye do it, and well i wot that love is a great mistress. and if my
 lady were here as she nis not, wit you well, said sir launcelot, ye should
 not bear away the worship. but beware your love be not discovered, for an
 sir tristram may know it ye will repent it; and sithen my quarrel is not
 here, ye shall have this day the worship as for me; considering the great
 travail and pain that ye have had this day, it were no worship for me to
 put you from it. and therewithal sir launcelot suffered sir palomides to
 depart.
 then sir launcelot by great force and might gat his own horse maugre
 twenty knights. so when sir launcelot was horsed he did many marvels, and
 so did sir tristram, and sir palomides in like wise. then sir launcelot
 smote down with a spear sir dinadan, and the king of scotland, and the
 king of wales, and the king of northumberland, and the king of listinoise.
 so then sir launcelot and his fellows smote down well a forty knights.
 then came the king of ireland and the king of the straight marches to
 rescue sir tristram and sir palomides. there began a great medley, and
 many knights were smitten down on both parties; and always sir launcelot
 spared sir tristram, and he spared him. and sir palomides would not meddle
 with sir launcelot, and so there was hurtling here and there. and then
 king arthur sent out many knights of the table round; and sir palomides
 was ever in the foremost front, and sir tristram did so strongly well that
 the king and all other had marvel. and then the king let blow to lodging;
 and because sir palomides began first, and never he went nor rode out of
 the field to repose, but ever he was doing marvellously well either on
 foot or on horseback, and longest during, king arthur and all the kings
 gave sir palomides the honour and the gree as for that day.
 then sir tristram commanded sir dinadan to fetch the queen la beale isoud,
 and bring her to his two pavilions that stood by the well. and so dinadan
 did as he was commanded. but when sir palomides understood and wist that
 sir tristram was in the red armour, and on a red horse, wit ye well that
 he was glad, and so was sir gareth and sir dinadan, for they all weened
 that sir tristram had been taken prisoner. and then every knight drew to
 his inn. and then king arthur and every knight spake of those knights; but
 above all men they gave sir palomides the prize, and all knights that knew
 sir palomides had wonder of his deeds. sir, said sir launcelot unto
 arthur, as for sir palomides an he be the green knight i dare say as for
 this day he is best worthy to have the degree, for he reposed him never,
 nor never changed his weeds, and he began first and longest held on. and
 yet, well i wot, said sir launcelot, that there was a better knight than
 he, and that shall be proved or we depart, upon pain of my life. thus they
 talked on either party; and so sir dinadan railed with sir tristram and
 said: what the devil is upon thee this day? for sir palomides' strength
 feebled never this day, but ever he doubled his strength.
 chapter lxxii. how sir dinadan provoked sir tristram to do well.
 and thou, sir tristram, farest all this day as though thou hadst been
 asleep, and therefore i call thee coward. well, dinadan, said sir
 tristram, i was never called coward or now of no earthly knight in my
 life; and wit thou well, sir, i call myself never the more coward though
 sir launcelot gave me a fall, for i outcept him of all knights. and doubt
 ye not sir dinadan, an sir launcelot have a quarrel good, he is too over
 good for any knight that now is living; and yet of his sufferance,
 largess, bounty, and courtesy, i call him knight peerless: and so sir
 tristram was in manner wroth with sir dinadan. but all this language sir
 dinadan said because he would anger sir tristram, for to cause him to
 awake his spirits and to be wroth; for well knew sir dinadan that an sir
 tristram were thoroughly wroth sir palomides should not get the prize upon
 the morn. and for this intent sir dinadan said all this railing and
 language against sir tristram. truly, said sir palomides, as for sir
 launcelot, of his noble knighthood, courtesy, and prowess, and gentleness,
 i know not his peer; for this day, said sir palomides, i did full
 uncourteously unto sir launcelot, and full unknightly, and full knightly
 and courteously he did to me again; for an he had been as ungentle to me
 as i was to him, this day i had won no worship. and therefore, said
 palomides, i shall be sir launcelot's knight while my life lasteth. this
 talking was in the houses of kings. but all kings, lords, and knights,
 said, of clear knighthood, and of pure strength, of bounty, of courtesy,
 sir launcelot and sir tristram bare the prize above all knights that ever
 were in arthur's days. and there were never knights in arthur's days did
 half so many deeds as they did; as the book saith, no ten knights did not
 half the deeds that they did, and there was never knight in their days
 that required sir launcelot or sir tristram of any quest, so it were not
 to their shame, but they performed their desire.
 chapter lxxiii. how king arthur and sir lancelot came to see la beale
 isoud, and how palomides smote down king arthur.
 so on the morn sir launcelot departed, and sir tristram was ready, and la
 beale isoud with sir palomides and sir gareth. and so they rode all in
 green full freshly beseen unto the forest. and sir tristram left sir
 dinadan sleeping in his bed. and so as they rode it happed the king and
 launcelot stood in a window, and saw sir tristram ride and isoud. sir,
 said launcelot, yonder rideth the fairest lady of the world except your
 queen, dame guenever. who is that? said sir arthur. sir, said he, it is
 queen isoud that, out-taken my lady your queen, she is makeless. take your
 horse, said arthur, and array you at all rights as i will do, and i
 promise you, said the king, i will see her. then anon they were armed and
 horsed, and either took a spear and rode unto the forest. sir, said
 launcelot, it is not good that ye go too nigh them, for wit ye well there
 are two as good knights as now are living, and therefore, sir, i pray you
 be not too hasty. for peradventure there will be some knights be
 displeased an we come suddenly upon them. as for that, said arthur, i will
 see her, for i take no force whom i grieve. sir, said launcelot, ye put
 yourself in great jeopardy. as for that, said the king, we will take the
 adventure. right so anon the king rode even to her, and saluted her, and
 said: god you save. sir, said she, ye are welcome. then the king beheld
 her, and liked her wonderly well.
 with that came sir palomides unto arthur, and said: uncourteous knight,
 what seekest thou here? thou art uncourteous to come upon a lady thus
 suddenly, therefore withdraw thee. sir arthur took none heed of sir
 palomides' words, but ever he looked still upon queen isoud then was sir
 palomides wroth, and therewith he took a spear, and came hurtling upon
 king arthur, and smote him down with a spear. when sir launcelot saw that
 despite of sir palomides, he said to himself: i am loath to have ado with
 yonder knight, and not for his own sake but for sir tristram. and one
 thing i am sure of, if i smite down sir palomides i must have ado with sir
 tristram, and that were overmuch for me to match them both, for they are
 two noble knights; notwithstanding, whether i live or i die, needs must i
 revenge my lord, and so will i, whatsomever befall of me. and therewith
 sir launcelot cried to sir palomides: keep thee from me. and then sir
 launcelot and sir palomides rushed together with two spears strongly, but
 sir launcelot smote sir palomides so hard that he went quite out of his
 saddle, and had a great fall. when sir tristram saw sir palomides have
 that fall, he said to sir launcelot: sir knight, keep thee, for i must
 joust with thee. as for to joust with me, said sir launcelot, i will not
 fail you, for no dread i have of you; but i am loath to have ado with you
 an i might choose, for i will that ye wit that i must revenge my special
 lord that was unhorsed unwarly and unknightly. and therefore, though i
 revenged that fall, take ye no displeasure therein, for he is to me such a
 friend that i may not see him shamed.
 anon sir tristram understood by his person and by his knightly words that
 it was sir launcelot du lake, and verily sir tristram deemed that it was
 king arthur, he that sir palomides had smitten down. and then sir tristram
 put his spear from him, and put sir palomides again on horseback, and sir
 launcelot put king arthur on horseback and so departed. so god me help,
 said sir tristram unto palomides, ye did not worshipfully when ye smote
 down that knight so suddenly as ye did. and wit ye well ye did yourself
 great shame, for the knights came hither of their gentleness to see a fair
 lady; and that is every good knight's part, to behold a fair lady; and ye
 had not ado to play such masteries afore my lady. wit thou well it will
 turn to anger, for he that ye smote down was king arthur, and that other
 was the good knight sir launcelot. but i shall not forget the words of sir
 launcelot when that he called him a man of great worship, thereby i wist
 that it was king arthur. and as for sir launcelot, an there had been five
 hundred knights in the meadow, he would not have refused them, and yet he
 said he would refuse me. by that again i wist that it was sir launcelot,
 for ever he forbeareth me in every place, and showeth me great kindness;
 and of all knights, i out-take none, say what men will say, he beareth the
 flower of all chivalry, say it him whosomever will. an he be well angered,
 and that him list to do his utterance without any favour, i know him not
 alive but sir launcelot is over hard for him, be it on horseback or on
 foot. i may never believe, said palomides, that king arthur will ride so
 privily as a poor errant knight. ah, said sir tristram, ye know not my
 lord arthur, for all knights may learn to be a knight of him. and
 therefore ye may be sorry, said sir tristram, of your unkindly deeds to so
 noble a king. and a thing that is done may not be undone, said palomides.
 then sir tristram sent queen isoud unto her lodging in the priory, there
 to behold all the tournament.
 chapter lxxiv. how the second day palomides forsook sir tristram, and went
 to the contrary part against him.
 then there was a cry unto all knights, that when they heard an horn blow
 they should make jousts as they did the first day. and like as the
 brethren sir edward and sir sadok began the jousts the first day, sir
 uwaine the king's son urien and sir lucanere de buttelere began the jousts
 the second day. and at the first encounter
 sir uwaine smote down the king's son of scots; and sir lucanere ran
 against the king of wales, and they brake their spears all to pieces; and
 they were so fierce both, that they hurtled together that both fell to the
 earth. then they of orkney horsed again sir lucanere. and then came in sir
 tristram de liones; and then sir tristram smote down sir uwaine and sir
 lucanere; and sir palomides smote down other two knights and sir gareth
 smote down other two knights. then said sir arthur unto sir launcelot: see
 yonder three knights do passingly well, and namely the first that jousted.
 sir, said launcelot, that knight began not yet but ye shall see him this
 day do marvellously. and then came into the place the duke's son of
 orkney, and then they began to do many deeds of arms.
 when sir tristram saw them so begin, he said to palomides: how feel ye
 yourself? may ye do this day as ye did yesterday? nay, said palomides, i
 feel myself so weary, and so sore bruised of the deeds of yesterday, that
 i may not endure as i did yesterday. that me repenteth, said sir tristram,
 for i shall lack you this day. sir palomides said: trust not to me, for i
 may not do as i did. all these words said palomides for to beguile sir
 tristram. sir, said sir tristram unto sir gareth, then must i trust upon
 you; wherefore i pray you be not far from me to rescue me. an need be,
 said sir gareth, i shall not fail you in all that i may do. then sir
 palomides rode by himself; and then in despite of sir tristram he put
 himself in the thickest press among them of orkney, and there he did so
 marvellously deeds of arms that all men had wonder of him, for there might
 none stand him a stroke.
 when sir tristram saw sir palomides do such deeds, he marvelled and said
 to himself: he is weary of my company. so sir tristram beheld him a great
 while and did but little else, for the noise and cry was so huge and great
 that sir tristram marvelled from whence came the strength that sir
 palomides had there in the field sir, said sir gareth unto sir tristram,
 remember ye not of the words that sir dinadan said to you yesterday, when
 he called you a coward; forsooth, sir, he said it for none ill, for ye are
 the man in the world that he most loveth, and all that he said was for
 your worship. and therefore, said sir gareth to sir tristram, let me know
 this day what ye be; and wonder ye not so upon sir palomides, for he
 enforceth himself to win all the worship and honour from you. i may well
 believe it, said sir tristram. and sithen i understand his evil will and
 his envy, ye shall see, if that i enforce myself, that the noise shall be
 left that now is upon him.
 then sir tristram rode into the thickest of the press, and then he did so
 marvellously well, and did so great deeds of arms, that all men said that
 sir tristram did double so much deeds of arms as sir palomides had done
 aforehand. and then the noise went plain from sir palomides, and all the
 people cried upon sir tristram. o jesu, said the people, see how sir
 tristram smiteth down with his spear so many knights. and see, said they
 all, how many knights he smiteth down with his sword, and of how many
 knights he rashed off their helms and their shields; and so he beat them
 all of orkney afore him. how now, said sir launcelot unto king arthur, i
 told you that this day there would a knight play his pageant. yonder
 rideth a knight ye may see he doth knightly, for he hath strength and
 wind. so god me help, said arthur to launcelot, ye say sooth, for i saw
 never a better knight, for he passeth far sir palomides. sir, wit ye well,
 said launcelot, it must be so of right, for it is himself, that noble
 knight sir tristram. i may right well believe it, said arthur.
 but when sir palomides heard the noise and the cry was turned from him, he
 rode out on a part and beheld sir tristram. and when sir palomides saw sir
 tristram do so marvellously well he wept passingly sore for despite, for
 he wist well he should no worship win that day; for well knew sir
 palomides, when sir tristram would put forth his strength and his manhood,
 be should get but little worship that day.
 chapter lxxv. how sir tristram departed of the field, and awaked sir
 dinadan, and changed his array into black.
 then came king arthur, and the king of northgalis, and sir launcelot du
 lake; and sir bleoberis, sir bors de ganis, sir ector de maris, these
 three knights came into the field with sir launcelot. and then sir
 launcelot with the three knights of his kin did so great deeds of arms
 that all the noise began upon sir launcelot. and so they beat the king of
 wales and the king of scots far aback, and made them to avoid the field;
 but sir tristram and sir gareth abode still in the field and endured all
 that ever there came, that all men had wonder that any knight might endure
 so many strokes. but ever sir launcelot, and his three kinsmen by the
 commandment of sir launcelot, forbare sir tristram. then said sir arthur:
 is that sir palomides that endureth so well? nay, said sir launcelot, wit
 ye well it is the good knight sir tristram, for yonder ye may see sir
 palomides beholdeth and hoveth, and doth little or nought. and sir, ye
 shall understand that sir tristram weeneth this day to beat us all out of
 the field. and as for me, said sir launcelot, i shall not beat him, beat
 him whoso will. sir, said launcelot unto arthur, ye may see how sir
 palomides hoveth yonder, as though he were in a dream; wit ye well he is
 full heavy that tristram doth such deeds of arms then is he but a fool,
 said arthur, for never was sir palomides, nor never shall be, of such
 prowess as sir tristram. and if he have any envy at sir tristram, and
 cometh in with him upon his side he is a false knight.
 as the king and sir launcelot thus spake, sir tristram rode privily out of
 the press, that none espied him but la beale isoud and sir palomides, for
 they two would not let off their eyes upon sir tristram. and when sir
 tristram came to his pavilions he found sir dinadan in his bed asleep.
 awake, said tristram, ye ought to be ashamed so to sleep when knights have
 ado in the field. then sir dinadan arose lightly and said: what will ye
 that i shall do? make you ready, said sir tristram, to ride with me into
 the field. so when sir dinadan was armed he looked upon sir tristram's
 helm and on his shield, and when he saw so many strokes upon his helm and
 upon his shield he said: in good time was i thus asleep, for had i been
 with you i must needs for shame there have followed you; more for shame
 than any prowess that is in me; that i see well now by those strokes that
 i should have been truly beaten as i was yesterday. leave your japes, said
 sir tristram, and come off, that [we] were in the field again. what, said
 sir dinadan, is your heart up? yesterday ye fared as though ye had
 dreamed. so then sir tristram was arrayed in black harness. o jesu, said
 dinadan, what aileth you this day? meseemeth ye be wilder than ye were
 yesterday. then smiled sir tristram and said to dinadan: await well upon
 me; if ye see me overmatched look that ye be ever behind me, and i shall
 make you ready way by god's grace. so sir tristram and sir dinadan took
 their horses. all this espied sir palomides, both their going and their
 coming, and so did la beale isoud, for she knew sir tristram above all
 other.
 chapter lxxvi. how sir palomides changed his shield and his armour for to
 hurt sir tristram, and how sir launcelot did to sir tristram.
 then when sir palomides saw that sir tristram was disguised, then he
 thought to do him a shame. so sir palomides rode to a knight that was sore
 wounded, that sat under a fair well from the field. sir knight, said sir
 palomides, i pray you to lend me your armour and your shield, for mine is
 over-well known in this field, and that hath done me great damage; and ye
 shall have mine armour and my shield that is as sure as yours. i will
 well, said the knight, that ye have mine armour and my shield, if they may
 do you any avail. so sir palomides armed him hastily in that knight's
 armour and his shield that shone as any crystal or silver, and so he came
 riding into the field. and then there was neither sir tristram nor none of
 king arthur's party that knew sir palomides. and right so as sir palomides
 was come into the field sir tristram smote down three knights, even in the
 sight of sir palomides. and then sir palomides rode against sir tristram,
 and either met other with great spears, that they brast to their hands.
 and then they dashed together with swords eagerly. then sir tristram had
 marvel what knight he was that did battle so knightly with him. then was
 sir tristram wroth, for he felt him passing strong, so that he deemed he
 might not have ado with the remnant of the knights, because of the
 strength of sir palomides. so they lashed together and gave many sad
 strokes together, and many knights marvelled what knight he might be that
 so encountered with the black knight, sir tristram. full well knew la
 beale isoud that there was sir palomides that fought with sir tristram,
 for she espied all in her window where that she stood, as sir palomides
 changed his harness with the wounded knight. and then she began to weep so
 heartily for the despite of sir palomides that there she swooned.
 then came in sir launcelot with the knights of orkney. and when the other
 party had espied sir launcelot, they cried: return, return, here cometh
 sir launcelot du lake. so there came knights and said: sir launcelot, ye
 must needs fight with yonder knight in the black harness, that was sir
 tristram, for he hath almost overcome that good knight that fighteth with
 him with the silver shield, that was sir palomides. then sir launcelot
 rode betwixt sir tristram and sir palomides, and sir launcelot said to
 palomides: sir knight, let me have the battle, for ye have need to be
 reposed. sir palomides knew sir launcelot well, and so did sir tristram,
 but because sir launcelot was far hardier knight than himself therefore he
 was glad, and suffered sir launcelot to fight with sir tristram. for well
 wist he that sir launcelot knew not sir tristram, and there he hoped that
 sir launcelot should beat or shame sir tristram, whereof sir palomides was
 full fain. and so sir launcelot gave sir tristram many sad strokes, but
 sir launcelot knew not sir tristram, but sir tristram knew well sir
 launcelot. and thus they fought long together, that la beale isoud was
 well-nigh out of her mind for sorrow.
 then sir dinadan told sir gareth how that knight in the black harness was
 sir tristram: and this is launcelot that fighteth with him, that must
 needs have the better of him, for sir tristram hath had too much travail
 this day. then let us smite him down, said sir gareth. so it is better
 that we do, said sir dinadan, than sir tristram be shamed, for yonder
 hoveth the strong knight with the silver shield to fall upon sir tristram
 if need be. then forthwithal gareth rushed upon sir launcelot, and gave
 him a great stroke upon his helm so hard that he was astonied. and then
 came sir dinadan with a spear, and he smote sir launcelot such a buffet
 that horse and all fell to the earth. o jesu, said sir tristram to sir
 gareth and sir dinadan, fie for shame, why did ye smite down so good a
 knight as he is, and namely when i had ado with him? now ye do yourself
 great shame, and him no disworship; for i held him reasonable hot, though
 ye had not holpen me.
 then came sir palomides that was disguised, and smote down sir dinadan
 from his horse. then sir launcelot, because sir dinadan had smitten him
 aforehand, then sir launcelot assailed sir dinadan passing sore, and sir
 dinadan defended him mightily. but well understood sir tristram that sir
 dinadan might not endure sir launcelot, wherefore sir tristram was sorry.
 then came sir palomides fresh upon sir tristram. and when sir tristram saw
 him come, he thought to deliver him at once, because that he would help
 sir dinadan, because he stood in great peril with sir launcelot. then sir
 tristram hurtled unto sir palomides and gave him a great buffet, and then
 sir tristram gat sir palomides and pulled him down underneath him. and so
 fell sir tristram with him; and sir tristram leapt up lightly and left sir
 palomides, and went betwixt sir launcelot and dinadan, and then they began
 to do battle together.
 right so sir dinadan gat sir tristram's horse, and said on high that sir
 launcelot might hear it: my lord sir tristram, take your horse. and when
 sir launcelot heard him name sir tristram: o jesu, said launcelot, what
 have i done? i am dishonoured. ah, my lord sir tristram, said launcelot,
 why were ye disguised? ye have put yourself in great peril this day; but i
 pray you noble knight to pardon me, for an i had known you we had not done
 this battle. sir, said sir tristram, this is not the first kindness ye
 showed me. so they were both horsed again.
 then all the people on the one side gave sir launcelot the honour and the
 degree, and on the other side all the people gave to the noble knight sir
 tristram the honour and the degree; but launcelot said nay thereto: for i
 am not worthy to have this honour, for i will report me unto all knights
 that sir tristram hath been longer in the field than i, and he hath
 smitten down many more knights this day than i have done. and therefore i
 will give sir tristram my voice and my name, and so i pray all my lords
 and fellows so to do. then there was the whole voice of dukes and earls,
 barons and knights, that sir tristram this day is proved the best knight.
 chapter lxxvii. how sir tristram departed with la beale isoud, and how
 palomides followed and excused him.
 then they blew unto lodging, and queen isoud was led unto her pavilions.
 but wit you well she was wroth out of measure with sir palomides, for she
 saw all his treason from the beginning to the ending. and all this while
 neither sir tristram, neither sir gareth nor dinadan, knew not of the
 treason of sir palomides; but afterward ye shall hear that there befell
 the greatest debate betwixt sir tristram and sir palomides that might be.
 so when the tournament was done, sir tristram, gareth, and dinadan, rode
 with la beale isoud to these pavilions. and ever sir palomides rode with
 them in their company disguised as he was. but when sir tristram had
 espied him that he was the same knight with the shield of silver that held
 him so hot that day: sir knight, said sir tristram, wit ye well here is
 none that hath need of your fellowship, and therefore i pray you depart
 from us. sir palomides answered again as though he had not known sir
 tristram: wit you well, sir knight, from this fellowship will i never
 depart, for one of the best knights of the world commanded me to be in
 this company, and till he discharge me of my service i will not be
 discharged. by that sir tristram knew that it was sir palomides. ah, sir
 palomides, said the noble knight sir tristram, are ye such a knight? ye
 have been named wrong, for ye have long been called a gentle knight, and
 as this day ye have showed me great ungentleness, for ye had almost
 brought me unto my death. but, as for you, i suppose i should have done
 well enough, but sir launcelot with you was overmuch; for i know no knight
 living but sir launcelot is over good for him, an he will do his
 uttermost. alas, said sir palomides, are ye my lord sir tristram? yea,
 sir, and that ye know well enough. by my knighthood, said palomides, until
 now i knew you not; i weened that ye had been the king of ireland, for
 well i wot ye bare his arms. his arms i bare, said sir tristram, and that
 will i stand by, for i won them once in a field of a full noble knight,
 his name was sir marhaus; and with great pain i won that knight, for there
 was none other recover, but sir marhaus died through false leeches; and
 yet was he never yolden to me. sir, said palomides, i weened ye had been
 turned upon sir launcelot's party, and that caused me to turn. ye say
 well, said sir tristram, and so i take you, and i forgive you.
 so then they rode into their pavilions; and when they were alighted they
 unarmed them and washed their faces and hands, and so yode unto meat, and
 were set at their table. but when isoud saw sir palomides she changed then
 her colours, and for wrath she might not speak. anon sir tristram espied
 her countenance and said: madam, for what cause make ye us such cheer? we
 have been sore travailed this day. mine own lord, said la beale isoud, for
 god's sake be ye not displeased with me, for i may none otherwise do; for
 i saw this day how ye were betrayed and nigh brought to your death. truly,
 sir, i saw every deal, how and in what wise, and therefore, sir, how
 should i suffer in your presence such a felon and traitor as sir
 palomides; for i saw him with mine eyes, how he beheld you when ye went
 out of the field. for ever he hoved still upon his horse till he saw you
 come in againward. and then forthwithal i saw him ride to the hurt knight,
 and changed harness with him, and then straight i saw him how he rode into
 the field. and anon as he had found you he encountered with you, and thus
 wilfully sir palomides did battle with you; and as for him, sir, i was not
 greatly afraid, but i dread sore launcelot, that knew you not. madam, said
 palomides, ye may say whatso ye will, i may not contrary you, but by my
 knighthood i knew not sir tristram. sir palomides, said sir tristram, i
 will take your excuse, but well i wot ye spared me but little, but all is
 pardoned on my part. then la beale isoud held down her head and said no
 more at that time.
 chapter lxxviii. how king arthur and sir launcelot came unto their
 pavilions as they sat at supper, and of sir palomides.
 and therewithal two knights armed came unto the pavilion, and there they
 alighted both, and came in armed at all pieces. fair knights, said sir
 tristram, ye are to blame to come thus armed at all pieces upon me while
 we are at our meat; if ye would anything when we were in the field there
 might ye have eased your hearts. not so, said the one of those knights, we
 come not for that intent, but wit ye well sir tristram, we be come hither
 as your friends. and i am come here, said the one, for to see you, and
 this knight is come for to see la beale isoud. then said sir tristram: i
 require you do off your helms that i may see you. that will we do at your
 desire, said the knights. and when their helms were off, sir tristram
 thought that he should know them.
 then said sir dinadan privily unto sir tristram: sir, that is sir
 launcelot du lake that spake unto you first, and the other is my lord king
 arthur. then, said sir tristram unto la beale isoud, madam arise, for here
 is my lord, king arthur. then the king and the queen kissed, and sir
 launcelot and sir tristram braced either other in arms, and then there was
 joy without measure; and at the request of la beale isoud, king arthur and
 launcelot were unarmed, and then there was merry talking. madam, said sir
 arthur, it is many a day sithen that i have desired to see you, for ye
 have been praised so far; and now i dare say ye are the fairest that ever
 i saw, and sir tristram is as fair and as good a knight as any that i
 know; therefore me beseemeth ye are well beset together. sir, god thank
 you, said the noble knight, sir tristram, and isoud; of your great
 goodness and largess ye are peerless. thus they talked of many things and
 of all the whole jousts. but for what cause, said king arthur, were ye,
 sir tristram, against us? ye are a knight of the table round; of right ye
 should have been with us. sir, said sir tristram, here is dinadan, and sir
 gareth your own nephew, caused me to be against you. my lord arthur, said
 gareth, i may well bear the blame, but it were sir tristram's own deeds.
 that may i repent, said dinadan, for this unhappy sir tristram brought us
 to this tournament, and many great buffets he caused us to have. then the
 king and launcelot laughed that they might not sit.
 what knight was that, said arthur, that held you so short, this with the
 shield of silver? sir, said sir tristram, here he sitteth at this board.
 what, said arthur, was it sir palomides? wit ye well it was he, said la
 beale isoud. so god me help, said arthur, that was unknightly done of you
 of so good a knight, for i have heard many people call you a courteous
 knight. sir, said palomides, i knew not sir tristram, for he was so
 disguised. so god me help, said launcelot, it may well be, for i knew not
 sir tristram; but i marvel why ye turned on our party. that was done for
 the same cause, said launcelot. as for that, said sir tristram, i have
 pardoned him, and i would be right loath to leave his fellowship, for i
 love right well his company: so they left off and talked of other things.
 and in the evening king arthur and sir launcelot departed unto their
 lodging; but wit ye well sir palomides had envy heartily, for all that
 night he had never rest in his bed, but wailed and wept out of measure. so
 on the morn sir tristram, gareth, and dinadan arose early, and then they
 went unto sir palomides' chamber, and there they found him fast asleep,
 for he had all night watched, and it was seen upon his cheeks that he had
 wept full sore. say nothing, said sir tristram, for i am sure he hath
 taken anger and sorrow for the rebuke that i gave to him, and la beale
 isoud.
 chapter lxxix. how sir tristram and sir palomides did the next day, and
 how king arthur was unhorsed.
 then sir tristram let call sir palomides, and bade him make him ready, for
 it was time to go to the field. when they were ready they were armed, and
 clothed all in red, both isoud and all they; and so they led her passing
 freshly through the field, into the priory where was her lodging. and then
 they heard three blasts blow, and every king and knight dressed him unto
 the field. and the first that was ready to joust was sir palomides and sir
 kainus le strange, a knight of the table round. and so they two
 encountered together, but sir palomides smote sir kainus so hard that he
 smote him quite over his horse's croup. and forthwithal sir palomides
 smote down another knight, and brake then his spear, and pulled out his
 sword and did wonderly well. and then the noise began greatly upon sir
 palomides. lo, said king arthur, yonder palomides beginneth to play his
 pageant. so god me help, said arthur, he is a passing good knight. and
 right as they stood talking thus, in came sir tristram as thunder, and he
 encountered with sir kay the seneschal, and there he smote him down quite
 from his horse; and with that same spear sir tristram smote down three
 knights more, and then he pulled out his sword and did marvellously. then
 the noise and cry changed from sir palomides and turned to sir tristram,
 and all the people cried: o tristram, o tristram. and then was sir
 palomides clean forgotten.
 how now, said launcelot unto arthur, yonder rideth a knight that playeth
 his pageants. so god me help, said arthur to launcelot, ye shall see this
 day that yonder two knights shall here do this day wonders. sir, said
 launcelot, the one knight waiteth upon the other, and enforceth himself
 through envy to pass the noble knight sir tristram, and he knoweth not of
 the privy envy the which sir palomides hath to him; for all that the noble
 sir tristram doth is through clean knighthood. and then sir gareth and
 dinadan did wonderly great deeds of arms, as two noble knights, so that
 king arthur spake of them great honour and worship; and the kings and
 knights of sir tristram's side did passingly well, and held them truly
 together. then sir arthur and sir launcelot took their horses and dressed
 them, and gat into the thickest of the press. and there sir tristram
 unknowing smote down king arthur, and then sir launcelot would have
 rescued him, but there were so many upon sir launcelot that they pulled
 him down from his horse. and then the king of ireland and the king of
 scots with their knights did their pain to take king arthur and sir
 launcelot prisoner. when sir launcelot heard them say so, he fared as it
 had been an hungry lion, for he fared so that no knight durst nigh him.
 then came sir ector de maris, and he bare a spear against sir palomides,
 and brast it upon him all to shivers. and then sir ector came again and
 gave sir palomides such a dash with a sword that he stooped down upon his
 saddle bow. and forthwithal sir ector pulled down sir palomides under his
 feet; and then sir ector de maris gat sir launcelot du lake an horse, and
 brought it to him, and bade him mount upon him; but sir palomides leapt
 afore and gat the horse by the bridle, and leapt into the saddle. so god
 me help, said launcelot, ye are better worthy to have that horse than i.
 then sir ector brought sir launcelot another horse. gramercy, said
 launcelot unto his brother. and so when he was horsed again, with one
 spear he smote down four knights. and then sir launcelot brought to king
 arthur one of the best of the four horses. then sir launcelot with king
 arthur and a few of his knights of sir launcelot's kin did marvellous
 deeds; for that time, as the book recordeth, sir launcelot smote down and
 pulled down thirty knights. notwithstanding the other party held them so
 fast together that king arthur and his knights were overmatched. and when
 sir tristram saw that, what labour king arthur and his knights, and in
 especial the noble deeds that sir launcelot did with his own hands, he
 marvelled greatly.
 chapter lxxx. how sir tristram turned to king arthur's side, and how
 palomides would not.
 then sir tristram called unto him sir palomides, sir gareth, and sir
 dinadan, and said thus to them: my fair fellows, wit ye well that i will
 turn unto king arthur's party, for i saw never so few men do so well, and
 it will be shame unto us knights that be of the round table to see our
 lord king arthur, and that noble knight sir launcelot, to be dishonoured.
 it will be well done, said sir gareth and sir dinadan. do your best, said
 palomides, for i will not change my party that i came in withal. that is
 for my sake, said sir tristram; god speed you in your journey. and so
 departed sir palomides from them. then sir tristram, gareth, and dinadan,
 turned with sir launcelot. and then sir launcelot smote down the king of
 ireland quite from his horse; and so sir launcelot smote down the king of
 scots, and the king of wales; and then sir arthur ran unto sir palomides
 and smote him quite from his horse; and then sir tristram bare down all
 that he met. sir gareth and sir dinadan did there as noble knights; then
 all the parties began to flee. alas, said palomides, that ever i should
 see this day, for now have i lost all the worship that i won; and then sir
 palomides went his way wailing, and so withdrew him till he came to a
 well, and there he put his horse from him, and did off his armour, and
 wailed and wept like as he had been a wood man. then many knights gave the
 prize to sir tristram, and there were many that gave the prize unto sir
 launcelot. fair lords, said sir tristram, i thank you of the honour ye
 would give me, but i pray you heartily that ye would give your voice to
 sir launcelot, for by my faith said sir tristram, i will give sir
 launcelot my voice. but sir launcelot would not have it, and so the prize
 was given betwixt them both.
 then every man rode to his lodging, and sir bleoberis and sir ector rode
 with sir tristram and la beale isoud unto their pavilions. then as sir
 palomides was at the well wailing and weeping, there came by him flying
 the kings of wales and of scotland, and they saw sir palomides in that
 arage. alas, said they, that so noble a man as ye be should be in this
 array. and then those kings gat sir palomides' horse again, and made him
 to arm him and mount upon his horse, and so he rode with them, making
 great dole. so when sir palomides came nigh the pavilions thereas sir
 tristram and la beale isoud was in, then sir palomides prayed the two
 kings to abide him there the while that he spake with sir tristram. and
 when he came to the port of the pavilions, sir palomides said on high:
 where art thou, sir tristram de liones? sir, said dinadan, that is
 palomides. what, sir palomides, will ye not come in here among us? fie on
 thee traitor, said palomides, for wit you well an it were daylight as it
 is night i should slay thee, mine own hands. and if ever i may get thee,
 said palomides, thou shalt die for this day's deed. sir palomides, said
 sir tristram, ye wite me with wrong, for had ye done as i did ye had won
 worship. but sithen ye give me so large warning i shall be well ware of
 you. fie on thee, traitor, said palomides, and therewith departed.
 then on the morn sir tristram, bleoberis, and sir ector de maris, sir
 gareth, sir dinadan, what by water and what by land, they brought la beale
 isoud unto joyous gard, and there reposed them a seven night, and made all
 the mirths and disports that they could devise. and king arthur and his
 knights drew unto camelot, and sir palomides rode with the two kings; and
 ever he made the greatest dole that any man could think, for he was not
 all only so dolorous for the departing from la beale isoud, but he was a
 part as sorrowful to depart from the fellowship of sir tristram; for sir
 tristram was so kind and so gentle that when sir palomides remembered him
 thereof he might never be merry.
 chapter lxxxi. how sir bleoberis and sir ector reported to queen guenever
 of the beauty of la beale isoud.
 so at the seven nights' end sir bleoberis and sir ector departed from sir
 tristram and from the queen; and these two good knights had great gifts;
 and sir gareth and sir dinadan abode with sir tristram. and when sir
 bleoberis and sir ector were come there as the queen guenever was lodged,
 in a castle by the seaside, and through the grace of god the queen was
 recovered of her malady, then she asked the two knights from whence they
 came. they said that they came from sir tristram and from la beale isoud.
 how doth sir tristram, said the queen, and la beale isoud? truly, said
 those two knights, he doth as a noble knight should do; and as for the
 queen isoud, she is peerless of all ladies; for to speak of her beauty,
 bounté, and mirth, and of her goodness, we saw never her match as far as
 we have ridden and gone. o mercy jesu, said queen guenever, so saith all
 the people that have seen her and spoken with her. god would that i had
 part of her conditions; and it is misfortuned me of my sickness while that
 tournament endured. and as i suppose i shall never see in all my life such
 an assembly of knights and ladies as ye have done.
 then the knights told her how palomides won the degree at the first day
 with great noblesse; and the second day sir tristram won the degree; and
 the third day sir launcelot won the degree. well, said queen guenever, who
 did best all these three days? so god me help, said these knights, sir
 launcelot and sir tristram had least dishonour. and wit ye well sir
 palomides did passing well and mightily; but he turned against the party
 that he came in withal, and that caused him to lose a great part of his
 worship, for it seemed that sir palomides is passing envious. then shall
 he never win worship, said queen guenever, for an it happeth an envious
 man once to win worship he shall be dishonoured twice therefore; and for
 this cause all men of worship hate an envious man, and will shew him no
 favour, and he that is courteous, and kind, and gentle, hath favour in
 every place.
 chapter lxxxii. how epinogris complained by a well, and how sir palomides
 came and found him, and of their both sorrowing.
 now leave we of this matter and speak we of sir palomides, that rode and
 lodged him with the two kings, whereof the kings were heavy. then the king
 of ireland sent a man of his to sir palomides, and gave him a great
 courser, and the king of scotland gave him great gifts; and fain they
 would have had sir palomides to have abiden with them, but in no wise he
 would abide; and so he departed, and rode as adventures would guide him,
 till it was nigh noon. and then in a forest by a well sir palomides saw
 where lay a fair wounded knight and his horse bounden by him; and that
 knight made the greatest dole that ever he heard man make, for ever he
 wept, and therewith he sighed as though he would die. then sir palomides
 rode near him and saluted him mildly and said: fair knight, why wail ye
 so? let me lie down and wail with you, for doubt not i am much more
 heavier than ye are; for i dare say, said palomides, that my sorrow is an
 hundred fold more than yours is, and therefore let us complain either to
 other. first, said the wounded knight, i require you tell me your name,
 for an thou be none of the noble knights of the round table thou shalt
 never know my name, whatsomever come of me. fair knight, said palomides,
 such as i am, be it better or be it worse, wit thou well that my name is
 sir palomides, son and heir unto king astlabor, and sir safere and sir
 segwarides are my two brethren; and wit thou well as for myself i was
 never christened, but my two brethren are truly christened. o noble
 knight, said that knight, well is me that i have met with you; and wit ye
 well my name is epinogris, the king's son of northumberland. now sit down,
 said epinogris, and let us either complain to other.
 then sir palomides began his complaint. now shall i tell you, said
 palomides, what woe i endure. i love the fairest queen and lady that ever
 bare life, and wit ye well her name is la beale isoud, king mark's wife of
 cornwall. that is great folly, said epinogris, for to love queen isoud,
 for one of the best knights of the world loveth her, that is sir tristram
 de liones. that is truth, said palomides, for no man knoweth that matter
 better than i do, for i have been in sir tristram's fellowship this month,
 and with la beale isoud together; and alas, said palomides, unhappy man
 that i am, now have i lost the fellowship of sir tristram for ever, and
 the love of la beale isoud for ever, and i am never like to see her more,
 and sir tristram and i be either to other mortal enemies. well, said
 epinogris, sith that ye loved la beale isoud, loved she you ever again by
 anything that ye could think or wit, or else did ye rejoice her ever in
 any pleasure? nay, by my knighthood, said palomides, i never espied that
 ever she loved me more than all the world, nor never had i pleasure with
 her, but the last day she gave me the greatest rebuke that ever i had, the
 which shall never go from my heart. and yet i well deserved that rebuke,
 for i did not knightly, and therefore i have lost the love of her and of
 sir tristram for ever; and i have many times enforced myself to do many
 deeds for la beale isoud's sake, and she was the causer of my
 worship-winning. alas, said sir palomides, now have i lost all the worship
 that ever i won, for never shall me befall such prowess as i had in the
 fellowship of sir tristram.
 chapter lxxxiii. how sir palomides brought sir epinogris his lady; and how
 sir palomides and sir safere were assailed.
 nay, nay, said epinogris, your sorrow is but japes to my sorrow; for i
 rejoiced my lady and won her with my hands, and lost her again: alas that
 day! thus first i won her, said epinogris; my lady was an earl's daughter,
 and as the earl and two knights came from the tournament of lonazep, for
 her sake i set upon this earl and on his two knights, my lady there being
 present; and so by fortune there i slew the earl and one of the knights,
 and the other knight fled, and so that night i had my lady. and on the
 morn as she and i reposed us at this well-side there came there to me an
 errant knight, his name was sir helior le preuse, an hardy knight, and
 this sir helior challenged me to fight for my lady. and then we went to
 battle first upon horse and after on foot, but at the last sir helior
 wounded me so that he left me for dead, and so he took my lady with him;
 and thus my sorrow is more than yours, for i have rejoiced and ye rejoiced
 never. that is truth, said palomides, but sith i can never recover myself
 i shall promise you if i can meet with sir helior i shall get you your
 lady again, or else he shall beat me.
 then sir palomides made sir epinogris to take his horse, and so they rode
 to an hermitage, and there sir epinogris rested him. and in the meanwhile
 sir palomides walked privily out to rest him under the leaves, and there
 beside he saw a knight come riding with a shield that he had seen sir
 ector de maris bear beforehand; and there came after him a ten knights,
 and so these ten knights hoved under the leaves for heat. and anon after
 there came a knight with a green shield and therein a white lion, leading
 a lady upon a palfrey. then this knight with the green shield that seemed
 to be master of the ten knights, he rode fiercely after sir helior, for it
 was he that hurt sir epinogris. and when he came nigh sir helior he bade
 him defend his lady. i will defend her, said helior, unto my power. and so
 they ran together so mightily that either of these knights smote other
 down, horse and all, to the earth; and then they won up lightly and drew
 their swords and their shields, and lashed together mightily more than an
 hour. all this sir palomides saw and beheld, but ever at the last the
 knight with sir ector's shield was bigger, and at the last this knight
 smote sir helior down, and then that knight unlaced his helm to have
 stricken off his head. and then he cried mercy, and prayed him to save his
 life, and bade him take his lady. then sir palomides dressed him up,
 because he wist well that that same lady was epinogris' lady, and he
 promised him to help him.
 then sir palomides went straight to that lady, and took her by the hand,
 and asked her whether she knew a knight that hight epinogris. alas, she
 said, that ever he knew me or i him, for i have for his sake lost my
 worship, and also his life grieveth me most of all. not so, lady, said
 palomides, come on with me, for here is epinogris in this hermitage. ah!
 well is me, said the lady, an he be alive. whither wilt thou with that
 lady? said the knight with sir ector's shield. i will do with her what me
 list, said palomides. wit you well, said that knight, thou speakest over
 large, though thou seemest me to have at advantage, because thou sawest me
 do battle but late. thou weenest, sir knight, to have that lady away from
 me so lightly? nay, think it never not; an thou were as good a knight as
 is sir launcelot, or as is sir tristram, or sir palomides, but thou shalt
 win her dearer than ever did i. and so they went unto battle upon foot,
 and there they gave many sad strokes, and either wounded other passing
 sore, and thus they fought still more than an hour.
 then sir palomides had marvel what knight he might be that was so strong
 and so well breathed during, and thus said palomides: knight, i require
 thee tell me thy name. wit thou well, said that knight, i dare tell thee
 my name, so that thou wilt tell me thy name. i will, said palomides.
 truly, said that knight, my name is safere, son of king astlabor, and sir
 palomides and sir segwarides are my brethren. now, and wit thou well, my
 name is sir palomides. then sir safere kneeled down upon his knees, and
 prayed him of mercy; and then they unlaced their helms and either kissed
 other weeping. and in the meanwhile sir epinogris arose out of his bed,
 and heard them by the strokes, and so he armed him to help sir palomides
 if need were.
 chapter lxxxiv. how sir palomides and sir safere conducted sir epinogris
 to his castle, and of other adventures.
 then sir palomides took the lady by the hand and brought her to sir
 epinogris, and there was great joy betwixt them, for either swooned for
 joy. when they were met: fair knight and lady, said sir safere, it were
 pity to depart you; jesu send you joy either of other. gramercy, gentle
 knight, said epinogris; and much more thanks be to my lord sir palomides,
 that thus hath through his prowess made me to get my lady. then sir
 epinogris required sir palomides and sir safere, his brother, to ride with
 them unto his castle, for the safeguard of his person. sir, said
 palomides, we will be ready to conduct you because that ye are sore
 wounded; and so was epinogris and his lady horsed, and his lady behind him
 upon a soft ambler. and then they rode unto his castle, where they had
 great cheer and joy, as great as ever sir palomides and sir safere had in
 their life-days.
 so on the morn sir safere and sir palomides departed, day until after
 noon. and at the last they heard a great weeping and a great noise down in
 a manor. sir, said then sir safere, let us wit what noise this is. i will
 well, said sir palomides. and so they rode forth till that they came to a
 fair gate of a manor, and there sat an old man saying his prayers and
 beads. then sir palomides and sir safere alighted and left their horses,
 and went within the gates, and there they saw full many goodly men
 weeping. fair sirs, said palomides, wherefore weep ye and make this
 sorrow? anon one of the knights of the castle beheld sir palomides and
 knew him, and then went to his fellows and said: fair fellows, wit ye well
 all, we have in this castle the same knight that slew our lord at lonazep,
 for i know him well; it is sir palomides. then they went unto harness, all
 that might bear harness, some on horseback and some on foot, to the number
 of three score. and when they were ready they came freshly upon sir
 palomides and upon sir safere with a great noise, and said thus: keep
 thee, sir palomides, for thou art known, and by right thou must be dead,
 for thou hast slain our lord; and therefore wit ye well we will slay thee,
 therefore defend thee.
 then sir palomides and sir safere, the one set his back to the other, and
 gave many great strokes, and took many great strokes; and thus they fought
 with a twenty knights and forty gentlemen and yeomen nigh two hours. but
 at the last though they were loath, sir palomides and sir safere were
 taken and yolden, and put in a strong prison; and within three days twelve
 knights passed upon them, and they found sir palomides guilty, and sir
 safere not guilty, of their lord's death. and when sir safere should be
 delivered there was great dole betwixt sir palomides and him, and many
 piteous complaints that sir safere made at his departing, there is no
 maker can rehearse the tenth part. fair brother, said palomides, let be
 thy dolour and thy sorrow. and if i be ordained to die a shameful death,
 welcome be it; but an i had wist of this death that i am deemed unto, i
 should never have been yolden. so sir safere departed from his brother
 with the greatest dolour and sorrow that ever made knight.
 and on the morn they of the castle ordained twelve knights to ride with
 sir palomides unto the father of the same knight that sir palomides slew;
 and so they bound his legs under an old steed's belly. and then they rode
 with sir palomides unto a castle by the seaside, that hight pelownes, and
 there sir palomides should have justice. thus was their ordinance; and so
 they rode with sir palomides fast by the castle of joyous gard. and as
 they passed by that castle there came riding out of that castle by them
 one that knew sir palomides. and when that knight saw sir palomides
 bounden upon a crooked courser, the knight asked sir palomides for what
 cause he was led so. ah, my fair fellow and knight, said palomides, i ride
 toward my death for the slaying of a knight at a tournament of lonazep;
 and if i had not departed from my lord sir tristram, as i ought not to
 have done, now might i have been sure to have had my life saved; but i
 pray you, sir knight, recommend me unto my lord, sir tristram, and unto my
 lady, queen isoud, and say to them if ever i trespassed to them i ask them
 forgiveness. and also i beseech you recommend me unto my lord, king
 arthur, and to all the fellowship of the round table, unto my power. then
 that knight wept for pity of sir palomides; and therewithal he rode unto
 joyous gard as fast as his horse might run, and lightly that knight
 descended down off his horse and went unto sir tristram, and there he told
 him all as ye have heard, and ever the knight wept as he had been mad.
 chapter lxxxv. how sir tristram made him ready to rescue sir palomides,
 but sir launcelot rescued him or he came.
 when sir tristram heard how sir palomides went to his death, he was heavy
 to hear that, and said: howbeit that i am wroth with sir palomides, yet
 will not i suffer him to die so shameful a death, for he is a full noble
 knight. and then anon sir tristram was armed and took his horse and two
 squires with him, and rode a great pace toward the castle of pelownes
 where sir palomides was judged to death. and these twelve knights that led
 sir palomides passed by a well whereas sir launcelot was, which was
 alighted there, and had tied his horse to a tree, and taken off his helm
 to drink of that well; and when he saw these knights, sir launcelot put on
 his helm and suffered them to pass by him. and then was he ware of sir
 palomides bounden, and led shamefully to his death. o jesu, said
 launcelot, what misadventure is befallen him that he is thus led toward
 his death? forsooth, said launcelot, it were shame to me to suffer this
 noble knight so to die an i might help him, therefore i will help him
 whatsomever come of it, or else i shall die for sir palomides' sake. and
 then sir launcelot mounted upon his horse, and gat his spear in his hand,
 and rode after the twelve knights that led sir palomides. fair knights,
 said sir launcelot, whither lead ye that knight? it beseemeth him full ill
 to ride bounden. then these twelve knights suddenly turned their horses
 and said to sir launcelot: sir knight, we counsel thee not to meddle with
 this knight, for he hath deserved death, and unto death he is judged. that
 me repenteth, said launcelot, that i may not borrow him with fairness, for
 he is over good a knight to die such a shameful death. and therefore, fair
 knights, said sir launcelot, keep you as well as ye can, for i will rescue
 that knight or die for it.
 then they began to dress their spears, and sir launcelot smote the
 foremost down, horse and man, and so he served three more with one spear;
 and then that spear brast, and therewithal sir launcelot drew his sword,
 and then he smote on the right hand and on the left hand. then within a
 while he left none of those twelve knights, but he had laid them to the
 earth, and the most part of them were sore wounded. and then sir launcelot
 took the best horse that he found, and loosed sir palomides and set him
 upon that horse; and so they returned again unto joyous gard, and then was
 sir palomides ware of sir tristram how he came riding. and when sir
 launcelot saw him he knew him well, but sir tristram knew him not because
 sir launcelot had on his shoulder a golden shield. so sir launcelot made
 him ready to joust with sir tristram, that sir tristram should not ween
 that he were sir launcelot. then sir palomides cried aloud to sir
 tristram: o my lord, i require you joust not with this knight, for this
 good knight hath saved me from my death. when sir tristram heard him say
 so he came a soft trotting pace toward them. and then sir palomides said:
 my lord, sir tristram, much am i beholding unto you of your great
 goodness, that would proffer your noble body to rescue me undeserved, for
 i have greatly offended you. notwithstanding, said sir palomides, here met
 we with this noble knight that worshipfully and manly rescued me from
 twelve knights, and smote them down all and wounded them sore.
 chapter lxxxvi. how sir tristram and launcelot, with palomides, came to
 joyous gard; and of palomides and sir tristram.
 fair knight, said sir tristram unto sir launcelot, of whence be ye? i am a
 knight errant, said sir launcelot, that rideth to seek many adventures.
 what is your name? said sir tristram. sir, at this time i will not tell
 you. then sir launcelot said unto sir tristram and to palomides: now
 either of you are met together i will depart from you. not so, said sir
 tristram; i pray you of knighthood to ride with me unto my castle. wit you
 well, said sir launcelot, i may not ride with you, for i have many deeds
 to do in other places, that at this time i may not abide with you. ah,
 mercy jesu, said sir tristram, i require you as ye be a true knight to the
 order of knighthood, play you with me this night. then sir tristram had a
 grant of sir launcelot: howbeit though he had not desired him he would
 have ridden with them, outher soon have come after them; for sir launcelot
 came for none other cause into that country but for to see sir tristram.
 and when they were come within joyous gard they alighted, and their horses
 were led into a stable; and then they unarmed them. and when sir launcelot
 was unhelmed, sir tristram and sir palomides knew him. then sir tristram
 took sir launcelot in arms, and so did la beale isoud; and palomides
 kneeled down upon his knees and thanked sir launcelot. when sir launcelot
 saw sir palomides kneel he lightly took him up and said thus: wit thou
 well, sir palomides, i and any knight in this land, of worship ought of
 very right succour and rescue so noble a knight as ye are proved and
 renowned, throughout all this realm endlong and overthwart. and then was
 there joy among them, and the oftener that sir palomides saw la beale
 isoud the heavier he waxed day by day.
 then sir launcelot within three or four days departed, and with him rode
 sir ector de maris; and dinadan and sir palomides were there left with sir
 tristram a two months and more. but ever sir palomides faded and mourned,
 that all men had marvel wherefore he faded so away. so upon a day, in the
 dawning, sir palomides went into the forest by himself alone; and there he
 found a well, and then he looked into the well, and in the water he saw
 his own visage, how he was disturbed and defaded, nothing like that he
 was. what may this mean? said sir palomides, and thus he said to himself:
 ah, palomides, palomides, why art thou defaded, thou that was wont to be
 called one of the fairest knights of the world? i will no more lead this
 life, for i love that i may never get nor recover. and therewithal he laid
 him down by the well. and then he began to make a rhyme of la beale isoud
 and him.
 and in the meanwhile sir tristram was that same day ridden into the forest
 to chase the hart of greese; but sir tristram would not ride a-hunting
 never more unarmed, because of sir breuse saunce pité. and so as sir
 tristram rode into that forest up and down, he heard one sing marvellously
 loud, and that was sir palomides that lay by the well. and then sir
 tristram rode softly thither, for he deemed there was some knight errant
 that was at the well. and when sir tristram came nigh him he descended
 down from his horse and tied his horse fast till a tree, and then he came
 near him on foot; and anon he was ware where lay sir palomides by the well
 and sang loud and merrily; and ever the complaints were of that noble
 queen, la beale isoud, the which was marvellously and wonderfully well
 said, and full dolefully and piteously made. and all the whole song the
 noble knight, sir tristram, heard from the beginning to the ending, the
 which grieved and troubled him sore.
 but then at the last, when sir tristram had heard all sir palomides'
 complaints, he was wroth out of measure, and thought for to slay him
 thereas he lay. then sir tristram remembered himself that sir palomides
 was unarmed, and of the noble name that sir palomides had, and the noble
 name that himself had, and then he made a restraint of his anger; and so
 he went unto sir palomides a soft pace and said: sir palomides, i have
 heard your complaint, and of thy treason that thou hast owed me so long,
 and wit thou well therefore thou shalt die; and if it were not for shame
 of knighthood thou shouldest not escape my hands, for now i know well thou
 hast awaited me with treason. tell me, said sir tristram, how thou wilt
 acquit thee? sir, said palomides, thus i will acquit me: as for queen la
 beale isoud, ye shall wit well that i love her above all other ladies in
 this world; and well i wot it shall befall me as for her love as befell to
 the noble knight sir kehydius, that died for the love of la beale isoud.
 and now, sir tristram, i will that ye wit that i have loved la beale isoud
 many a day, and she hath been the causer of my worship, and else i had
 been the most simplest knight in the world. for by her, and because of
 her, i have won the worship that i have; for when i remembered me of la
 beale isoud i won the worship wheresomever i came for the most part; and
 yet had i never reward nor bounté of her the days of my life, and yet have
 i been her knight guerdonless. and therefore, sir tristram, as for any
 death i dread not, for i had as lief die as to live. and if i were armed
 as thou art, i should lightly do battle with thee. well have ye uttered
 your treason, said tristram. i have done to you no treason, said
 palomides, for love is free for all men, and though i have loved your
 lady, she is my lady as well as yours; howbeit i have wrong if any wrong
 be, for ye rejoice her, and have your desire of her, and so had i never
 nor never am like to have, and yet shall i love her to the uttermost days
 of my life as well as ye.
 chapter lxxxvii. how there was a day set between sir tristram and sir
 palomides for to fight, and how sir tristram was hurt.
 then said sir tristram: i will fight with you to the uttermost. i grant,
 said palomides, for in a better quarrel keep i never to fight, for an i
 die of your hands, of a better knight's hands may i not be slain. and
 sithen i understand that i shall never rejoice la beale isoud, i have as
 good will to die as to live. then set ye a day, said sir tristram, that we
 shall do battle. this day fifteen days, said palomides, will i meet with
 you hereby, in the meadow under joyous gard. fie for shame, said sir
 tristram, will ye set so long day? let us fight to-morn. not so, said
 palomides, for i am meagre, and have been long sick for the love of la
 beale isoud, and therefore i will repose me till i have my strength again.
 so then sir tristram and sir palomides promised faith fully to meet at the
 well that day fifteen days. i am remembered, said sir tristram to
 palomides, that ye brake me once a promise when that i rescued you from
 breuse saunce pité and nine knights; and then ye promised me to meet me at
 the peron and the grave beside camelot, whereas at that time ye failed of
 your promise. wit you well, said palomides unto sir tristram, i was at
 that day in prison, so that i might not hold my promise. so god me help,
 said sir tristram, an ye had holden your promise this work had not been
 here now at this time.
 right so departed sir tristram and sir palomides. and so sir palomides
 took his horse and his harness, and he rode unto king arthur's court; and
 there sir palomides gat him four knights and four sergeants-of-arms, and
 so he returned againward unto joyous gard. and in the meanwhile sir
 tristram chased and hunted at all manner of venery; and about three days
 afore the battle should be, as sir tristram chased an hart, there was an
 archer shot at the hart, and by misfortune he smote sir tristram in the
 thick of the thigh, and the arrow slew sir tristram's horse and hurt him.
 when sir tristram was so hurt he was passing heavy, and wit ye well he
 bled sore; and then he took another horse, and rode unto joyous gard with
 great heaviness, more for the promise that he had made with sir palomides,
 as to do battle with him within three days after, than for any hurt of his
 thigh. wherefore there was neither man nor woman that could cheer him with
 anything that they could make to him, neither queen la beale isoud; for
 ever he deemed that sir palomides had smitten him so that he should not be
 able to do battle with him at the day set.
 chapter lxxxviii. how sir palomides kept his day to have foughten, but sir
 tristram might not come; and other things.
 but in no wise there was no knight about sir tristram that would believe
 that ever sir palomides would hurt sir tristram, neither by his own hands
 nor by none other consenting. then when the fifteenth day was come, sir
 palomides came to the well with four knights with him of arthur's court,
 and three sergeants-of-arms. and for this intent sir palomides brought the
 knights with him and the sergeants-of-arms, for they should bear record of
 the battle betwixt sir tristram and sir palomides. and the one sergeant
 brought in his helm, the other his spear, the third his sword. so thus
 palomides came into the field, and there he abode nigh two hours; and then
 he sent a squire unto sir tristram, and desired him to come into the field
 to hold his promise.
 when the squire was come to joyous gard, anon as sir tristram heard of his
 coming he let command that the squire should come to his presence thereas
 he lay in his bed. my lord sir tristram, said palomides' squire, wit you
 well my lord, palomides, abideth you in the field, and he would wit
 whether ye would do battle or not. ah, my fair brother, said sir tristram,
 wit thou well that i am right heavy for these tidings; therefore tell sir
 palomides an i were well at ease i would not lie here, nor he should have
 no need to send for me an i might either ride or go; and for thou shalt
 say that i am no liar—sir tristram showed him his thigh that the
 wound was six inches deep. and now thou hast seen my hurt, tell thy lord
 that this is no feigned matter, and tell him that i had liefer than all
 the gold of king arthur that i were whole; and tell palomides as soon as i
 am whole i shall seek him endlong and overthwart, and that i promise you
 as i am true knight; and if ever i may meet with him, he shall have battle
 of me his fill. and with this the squire departed; and when palomides wist
 that tristram was hurt he was glad and said: now i am sure i shall have no
 shame, for i wot well i should have had hard handling of him, and by
 likely i must needs have had the worse, for he is the hardest knight in
 battle that now is living except sir launcelot.
 and then departed sir palomides whereas fortune led him, and within a
 month sir tristram was whole of his hurt. and then he took his horse, and
 rode from country to country, and all strange adventures he achieved
 wheresomever he rode; and always he enquired for sir palomides, but of all
 that quarter of summer sir tristram could never meet with sir palomides.
 but thus as sir tristram sought and enquired after sir palomides sir
 tristram achieved many great battles, wherethrough all the noise fell to
 sir tristram, and it ceased of sir launcelot; and therefore sir
 launcelot's brethren and his kinsmen would have slain sir tristram because
 of his fame. but when sir launcelot wist how his kinsmen were set, he said
 to them openly: wit you well, that an the envy of you all be so hardy to
 wait upon my lord, sir tristram, with any hurt, shame, or villainy, as i
 am true knight i shall slay the best of you with mine own hands alas, fie
 for shame, should ye for his noble deeds await upon him to slay him. jesu
 defend, said launcelot, that ever any noble knight as sir tristram is
 should be destroyed with treason. of this noise and fame sprang into
 cornwall, and among them of liones, whereof they were passing glad, and
 made great joy. and then they of liones sent letters unto sir tristram of
 recommendation, and many great gifts to maintain sir tristram's estate;
 and ever, between, sir tristram resorted unto joyous gard whereas la beale
 isoud was, that loved him as her life.
here endeth the tenth book which is of sir tristram. and here followeth
 the eleventh book which is of sir launcelot.
 chapter i. how sir launcelot rode on his adventure, and how he holp a
 dolorous lady from her pain, and how that he fought with a dragon.
 now leave we sir tristram de liones, and speak we of sir launcelot du
 lake, and of sir galahad, sir launcelot's son, how he was gotten, and in
 what manner, as the book of french rehearseth. afore the time that sir
 galahad was gotten or born, there came in an hermit unto king arthur upon
 whitsunday, as the knights sat at the table round. and when the hermit saw
 the siege perilous, he asked the king and all the knights why that siege
 was void. sir arthur and all the knights answered: there shall never none
 sit in that siege but one, but if he be destroyed. then said the hermit:
 wot ye what is he? nay, said arthur and all the knights, we wot not who is
 he that shall sit therein. then wot i, said the hermit, for he that shall
 sit there is unborn and ungotten, and this same year he shall be gotten
 that shall sit there in that siege perilous, and he shall win the
 sangreal. when this hermit had made this mention he departed from the
 court of king arthur.
 and then after this feast sir launcelot rode on his adventure, till on a
 time by adventure he passed over the pont of corbin; and there he saw the
 fairest tower that ever he saw, and there-under was a fair town full of
 people; and all the people, men and women, cried at once: welcome, sir
 launcelot du lake, the flower of all knighthood, for by thee all we shall
 be holpen out of danger. what mean ye, said sir launcelot, that ye cry so
 upon me? ah, fair knight, said they all, here is within this tower a
 dolorous lady that hath been there in pains many winters and days, for
 ever she boileth in scalding water; and but late, said all the people, sir
 gawaine was here and he might not help her, and so he left her in pain. so
 may i, said sir launcelot, leave her in pain as well as sir gawaine did.
 nay, said the people, we know well that it is sir launcelot that shall
 deliver her. well, said launcelot, then shew me what i shall do.
 then they brought sir launcelot into the tower; and when he came to the
 chamber thereas this lady was, the doors of iron unlocked and unbolted.
 and so sir launcelot went into the chamber that was as hot as any stew.
 and there sir launcelot took the fairest lady by the hand that ever he
 saw, and she was naked as a needle; and by enchantment queen morgan le fay
 and the queen of northgalis had put her there in that pains, because she
 was called the fairest lady of that country; and there she had been five
 years, and never might she be delivered out of her great pains unto the
 time the best knight of the world had taken her by the hand. then the
 people brought her clothes. and when she was arrayed, sir launcelot
 thought she was the fairest lady of the world, but if it were queen
 guenever.
 then this lady said to sir launcelot: sir, if it please you will ye go
 with me hereby into a chapel that we may give loving and thanking unto
 god? madam, said sir launcelot, come on with me, i will go with you. so
 when they came there and gave thankings to god all the people, both
 learned and lewd, gave thankings unto god and him, and said: sir knight,
 since ye have delivered this lady, ye shall deliver us from a serpent
 there is here in a tomb. then sir launcelot took his shield and said:
 bring me thither, and what i may do unto the pleasure of god and you i
 will do. so when sir launcelot came thither he saw written upon the tomb
 letters of gold that said thus: here shall come a leopard of king's blood,
 and he shall slay this serpent, and this leopard shall engender a lion in
 this foreign country, the which lion shall pass all other knights. so then
 sir launcelot lift up the tomb, and there came out an horrible and a
 fiendly dragon, spitting fire out of his mouth. then sir launcelot drew
 his sword and fought with the dragon long, and at the last with great pain
 sir launcelot slew that dragon. therewithal came king pelles, the good and
 noble knight, and saluted sir launcelot, and he him again. fair knight,
 said the king, what is your name? i require you of your knighthood tell
 me!
 chapter ii. how sir launcelot came to pelles, and of the sangreal, and of
 elaine, king pelles' daughter.
 sir, said launcelot, wit you well my name is sir launcelot du lake. and my
 name is, said the king, pelles, king of the foreign country, and cousin
 nigh unto joseph of armathie. and then either of them made much of other,
 and so they went into the castle to take their repast. and anon there came
 in a dove at a window, and in her mouth there seemed a little censer of
 gold. and herewithal there was such a savour as all the spicery of the
 world had been there. and forthwithal there was upon the table all manner
 of meats and drinks that they could think upon. so came in a damosel
 passing fair and young, and she bare a vessel of gold betwixt her hands;
 and thereto the king kneeled devoutly, and said his prayers, and so did
 all that were there. o jesu, said sir launcelot, what may this mean? this
 is, said the king, the richest thing that any man hath living. and when
 this thing goeth about, the round table shall be broken; and wit thou
 well, said the king, this is the holy sangreal that ye have here seen. so
 the king and sir launcelot led their life the most part of that day. and
 fain would king pelles have found the mean to have had sir launcelot to
 have lain by his daughter, fair elaine. and for this intent: the king knew
 well that sir launcelot should get a child upon his daughter, the which
 should be named sir galahad the good knight, by whom all the foreign
 country should be brought out of danger, and by him the holy greal should
 be achieved.
 then came forth a lady that hight dame brisen, and she said unto the king:
 sir, wit ye well sir launcelot loveth no lady in the world but all only
 queen guenever; and therefore work ye by counsel, and i shall make him to
 lie with your daughter, and he shall not wit but that he lieth with queen
 guenever. o fair lady, dame brisen, said the king, hope ye to bring this
 about? sir, said she, upon pain of my life let me deal; for this brisen
 was one of the greatest enchantresses that was at that time in the world
 living. then anon by dame brisen's wit she made one to come to sir
 launcelot that he knew well. and this man brought him a ring from queen
 guenever like as it had come from her, and such one as she was wont for
 the most part to wear; and when sir launcelot saw that token wit ye well
 he was never so fain. where is my lady? said sir launcelot. in the castle
 of case, said the messenger, but five mile hence. then sir launcelot
 thought to be there the same might. and then this brisen by the
 commandment of king pelles let send elaine to this castle with twenty-five
 knights unto the castle of case. then sir launcelot against night rode
 unto that castle, and there anon he was received worshipfully with such
 people, to his seeming, as were about queen guenever secret.
 so when sir launcelot was alighted, he asked where the queen was. so dame
 brisen said she was in her bed; and then the people were avoided, and sir
 launcelot was led unto his chamber. and then dame brisen brought sir
 launcelot a cup full of wine; and anon as he had drunken that wine he was
 so assotted and mad that he might make no delay, but withouten any let he
 went to bed; and he weened that maiden elaine had been queen guenever. wit
 you well that sir launcelot was glad, and so was that lady elaine that she
 had gotten sir launcelot in her arms. for well she knew that same night
 should be gotten upon her galahad that should prove the best knight of the
 world; and so they lay together until underne of the' morn; and all the
 windows and holes of that chamber were stopped that no manner of day might
 be seen. and then sir launcelot remembered him, and he arose up and went
 to the window.
 chapter iii. how sir launcelot was displeased when he knew that he had
 lain by dame elaine, and how she was delivered of galahad.
 and anon as he had unshut the window the enchantment was gone; then he
 knew himself that he had done amiss. alas, he said, that i have lived so
 long; now i am shamed. so then he gat his sword in his hand and said: thou
 traitress, what art thou that i have lain by all this night? thou shalt
 die right here of my hands. then this fair lady elaine skipped out of her
 bed all naked, and kneeled down afore sir launcelot, and said: fair
 courteous knight, come of king's blood, i require you have mercy upon me,
 and as thou art renowned the most noble knight of the world, slay me not,
 for i have in my womb him by thee that shall be the most noblest knight of
 the world. ah, false traitress, said sir launcelot, why hast thou betrayed
 me? anon tell me what thou art. sir, she said, i am elaine, the daughter
 of king pelles. well, said sir launcelot, i will forgive you this deed;
 and therewith he took her up in his arms, and kissed her, for she was as
 fair a lady, and thereto lusty and young, and as wise, as any was that
 time living. so god me help, said sir launcelot, i may not wite this to
 you; but her that made this enchantment upon me as between you and me, an
 i may find her, that same lady brisen, she shall lose her head for
 witchcrafts, for there was never knight deceived so as i am this night.
 and so sir launcelot arrayed him, and armed him, and took his leave mildly
 at that lady young elaine, and so he departed. then she said: my lord sir
 launcelot, i beseech you see me as soon as ye may, for i have obeyed me
 unto the prophecy that my father told me. and by his commandment to fulfil
 this prophecy i have given the greatest riches and the fairest flower that
 ever i had, and that is my maidenhood that i shall never have again; and
 therefore, gentle knight, owe me your good will.
 and so sir launcelot arrayed him and was armed, and took his leave mildly
 at that young lady elaine; and so he departed, and rode till he came to
 the castle of corbin, where her father was. and as fast as her time came
 she was delivered of a fair child, and they christened him galahad; and
 wit ye well that child was well kept and well nourished, and he was named
 galahad because sir launcelot was so named at the fountain stone; and
 after that the lady of the lake confirmed him sir launcelot du lake.
 then after this lady was delivered and churched, there came a knight unto
 her, his name was sir bromel la pleche, the which was a great lord; and he
 had loved that lady long, and he evermore desired her to wed her; and so
 by no mean she could put him off, till on a day she said to sir bromel:
 wit thou well, sir knight, i will not love you, for my love is set upon
 the best knight of the world. who is he? said sir bromel. sir, she said,
 it is sir launcelot du lake that i love and none other, and therefore woo
 me no longer. ye say well, said sir bromel, and sithen ye have told me so
 much, ye shall have but little joy of sir launcelot, for i shall slay him
 wheresomever i meet him. sir, said the lady elaine, do to him no treason.
 wit ye well, my lady, said bromel, and i promise you this twelvemonth i
 shall keep the pont of corbin for sir launcelot's sake, that he shall
 neither come nor go unto you, but i shall meet with him.
 chapter iv. how sir bors came to dame elaine and saw galahad, and how he
 was fed with the sangreal.
 then as it fell by fortune and adventure, sir bors de ganis, that was
 nephew unto sir launcelot, came over that bridge; and there sir bromel and
 sir bors jousted, and sir bors smote sir bromel such a buffet that he bare
 him over his horse's croup. and then sir bromel, as an hardy knight,
 pulled out his sword, and dressed his shield to do battle with sir bors.
 and then sir bors alighted and avoided his horse, and there they dashed
 together many sad strokes; and long thus they fought, till at the last sir
 bromel was laid to the earth, and there sir bors began to unlace his helm
 to slay him. then sir bromel cried sir bors mercy, and yielded him. upon
 this covenant thou shalt have thy life, said sir bors, so thou go unto sir
 launcelot upon whitsunday that next cometh, and yield thee unto him as
 knight recreant. i will do it, said sir bromel, and that he sware upon the
 cross of the sword. and so he let him depart, and sir bors rode unto king
 pelles, that was within corbin.
 and when the king and elaine his daughter wist that sir bors was nephew
 unto sir launcelot, they made him great cheer. then said dame elaine: we
 marvel where sir launcelot is, for he came never here but once. marvel
 not, said sir bors, for this half year he hath been in prison with queen
 morgan le fay, king arthur's sister. alas, said dame elaine, that me
 repenteth. and ever sir bors beheld that child in her arms, and ever him
 seemed it was passing like sir launcelot. truly, said elaine, wit ye well
 this child he gat upon me. then sir bors wept for joy, and he prayed to
 god it might prove as good a knight as his father was. and so came in a
 white dove, and she bare a little censer of gold in her mouth, and there
 was all manner of meats and drinks; and a maiden bare that sangreal, and
 she said openly: wit you well, sir bors, that this child is galahad, that
 shall sit in the siege perilous, and achieve the sangreal, and he shall be
 much better than ever was sir launcelot du lake, that is his own father.
 and then they kneeled down and made their devotions, and there was such a
 savour as all the spicery in the world had been there. and when the dove
 took her flight, the maiden vanished with the sangreal as she came.
 sir, said sir bors unto king pelles, this castle may be named the castle
 adventurous, for here be many strange adventures. that is sooth, said the
 king, for well may this place be called the adventures place, for there
 come but few knights here that go away with any worship; be he never so
 strong, here he may be proved; and but late sir gawaine, the good knight,
 gat but little worship here. for i let you wit, said king pelles, here
 shall no knight win no worship but if he be of worship himself and of good
 living, and that loveth god and dreadeth god, and else he getteth no
 worship here, be he never so hardy. that is wonderful thing, said sir
 bors. what ye mean in this country i wot not, for ye have many strange
 adventures, and therefore i will lie in this castle this night. ye shall
 not do so, said king pelles, by my counsel, for it is hard an ye escape
 without a shame. i shall take the adventure that will befall me, said sir
 bors. then i counsel you, said the king, to be confessed clean. as for
 that, said sir bors, i will be shriven with a good will. so sir bors was
 confessed, and for all women sir bors was a virgin, save for one, that was
 the daughter of king brangoris, and on her he gat a child that hight
 elaine, and save for her sir bors was a clean maiden.
 and so sir bors was led unto bed in a fair large chamber, and many doors
 were shut about the chamber. when sir bors espied all those doors, he
 avoided all the people, for he might have nobody with him; but in no wise
 sir bors would unarm him, but so he laid him down upon the bed. and right
 so he saw come in a light, that he might well see a spear great and long
 that came straight upon him pointling, and to sir bors seemed that the
 head of the spear brent like a taper. and anon, or sir bors wist, the
 spear head smote him into the shoulder an hand-breadth in deepness, and
 that wound grieved sir bors passing sore. and then he laid him down again
 for pain; and anon therewithal there came a knight armed with his shield
 on his shoulder and his sword in his hand, and he bade sir bors: arise,
 sir knight, and fight with me. i am sore hurt, he said, but yet i shall
 not fail thee. and then sir bors started up and dressed his shield; and
 then they lashed together mightily a great while; and at the last sir bors
 bare him backward until that he came unto a chamber door, and there that
 knight yede into that chamber and rested him a great while. and when he
 had reposed him he came out freshly again, and began new battle with sir
 bors mightily and strongly.
 chapter v. how sir bors made sir pedivere to yield him, and of marvellous
 adventures that he had, and how he achieved them.
 then sir bors thought he should no more go into that chamber to rest him,
 and so sir bors dressed him betwixt the knight and that chamber door, and
 there sir bors smote him down, and then that knight yielded him what is
 your name? said sir bors. sir, said he, my name is pedivere of the
 straight marches. so sir bors made him to swear at whitsunday next coming
 to be at the court of king arthur, and yield him there as a prisoner as an
 overcome knight by the hands of sir bors. so thus departed sir pedivere of
 the straight marches. and then sir bors laid him down to rest, and then he
 heard and felt much noise in that chamber; and then sir bors espied that
 there came in, he wist not whether at the doors nor windows, shot of
 arrows and of quarrels so thick that he marvelled, and many fell upon him
 and hurt him in the bare places.
 and then sir bors was ware where came in an hideous lion; so sir bors
 dressed him unto the lion, and anon the lion bereft him his shield, and
 with his sword sir bors smote off the lion's head. right so sir bors
 forthwithal saw a dragon in the court passing horrible, and there seemed
 letters of gold written in his forehead; and sir bors thought that the
 letters made a signification of king arthur. right so there came an
 horrible leopard and an old, and there they fought long, and did great
 battle together. and at the last the dragon spit out of his mouth as it
 had been an hundred dragons; and lightly all the small dragons slew the
 old dragon and tare him all to pieces.
 anon withal there came an old man into the hall, and he sat him down in a
 fair chair, and there seemed to be two adders about his neck; and then the
 old man had an harp, and there he sang an old song how joseph of armathie
 came into this land. then when he had sung, the old man bade sir bors go
 from thence. for here shall ye have no more adventures; and full
 worshipfully have ye done, and better shall ye do hereafter. and then sir
 bors seemed that there came the whitest dove with a little golden censer
 in her mouth. and anon therewithal the tempest ceased and passed, that
 afore was marvellous to hear. so was all that court full of good savours.
 then sir bors saw four children bearing four fair tapers, and an old man
 in the midst of the children with a censer in his own hand, and a spear in
 his other hand, and that spear was called the spear of vengeance.
 chapter vi. how sir bors departed; and how sir launcelot was rebuked of
 queen guenever, and of his excuse.
 now, said that old man to sir bors, go ye to your cousin, sir launcelot,
 and tell him of this adventure the which had been most convenient for him
 of all earthly knights; but sin is so foul in him he may not achieve such
 holy deeds, for had not been his sin he had passed all the knights that
 ever were in his days; and tell thou sir launcelot, of all worldly
 adventures he passeth in manhood and prowess all other, but in this
 spiritual matters he shall have many his better. and then sir bors saw
 four gentlewomen come by him, purely beseen: and he saw where that they
 entered into a chamber where was great light as it were a summer light;
 and the women kneeled down afore an altar of silver with four pillars, and
 as it had been a bishop kneeled down afore that table of silver. and as
 sir bors looked over his head he saw a sword like silver, naked, hoving
 over his head, and the clearness thereof smote so in his eyes that as at
 that time sir bors was blind; and there he heard a voice that said: go
 hence, thou sir bors, for as yet thou art not worthy for to be in this
 place. and then he yede backward to his bed till on the morn. and on the
 morn king pelles made great joy of sir bors; and then he departed and rode
 to camelot, and there he found sir launcelot du lake, and told him of the
 adventures that he had seen with king pelles at corbin.
 so the noise sprang in arthur's court that launcelot had gotten a child
 upon elaine, the daughter of king pelles, wherefore queen guenever was
 wroth, and gave many rebukes to sir launcelot, and called him false
 knight. and then sir launcelot told the queen all, and how he was made to
 lie by her by enchantment in likeness of the queen. so the queen held sir
 launcelot excused. and as the book saith, king arthur had been in france,
 and had made war upon the mighty king claudas, and had won much of his
 lands. and when the king was come again he let cry a great feast, that all
 lords and ladies of all england should be there, but if it were such as
 were rebellious against him.
 chapter vii. how dame elaine, galahad's mother, came in great estate unto
 camelot, and how sir launcelot behaved him there.
 and when dame elaine, the daughter of king pelles, heard of this feast she
 went to her father and required him that he would give her leave to ride
 to that feast. the king answered: i will well ye go thither, but in any
 wise as ye love me and will have my blessing, that ye be well beseen in
 the richest wise; and look that ye spare not for no cost; ask and ye shall
 have all that you needeth. then by the advice of dame brisen, her maiden,
 all thing was apparelled unto the purpose, that there was never no lady
 more richlier beseen. so she rode with twenty knights, and ten ladies, and
 gentlewomen, to the number of an hundred horses. and when she came to
 camelot, king arthur and queen guenever said, and all the knights, that
 dame elaine was the fairest and the best beseen lady that ever was seen in
 that court. and anon as king arthur wist that she was come he met her and
 saluted her, and so did the most part of all the knights of the round
 table, both sir tristram, sir bleoberis, and sir gawaine, and many more
 that i will not rehearse. but when sir launcelot saw her he was so
 ashamed, and that because he drew his sword on the morn when he had lain
 by her, that he would not salute her nor speak to her; and yet sir
 launcelot thought she was the fairest woman that ever he saw in his
 life-days.
 but when dame elaine saw sir launcelot that would not speak unto her she
 was so heavy that she weened her heart would have to-brast; for wit you
 well, out of measure she loved him. and then elaine said unto her woman,
 dame brisen: the unkindness of sir launcelot slayeth me near. ah, peace,
 madam, said dame brisen, i will undertake that this night he shall lie
 with you, an ye would hold you still. that were me liefer, said dame
 elaine, than all the gold that is above the earth. let me deal, said dame
 brisen. so when elaine was brought unto queen guenever either made other
 good cheer by countenance, but nothing with hearts. but all men and women
 spake of the beauty of dame elaine, and of her great riches.
 then, at night, the queen commanded that dame elaine should sleep in a
 chamber nigh her chamber, and all under one roof; and so it was done as
 the queen commanded. then the queen sent for sir launcelot and bade him
 come to her chamber that night: or else i am sure, said the queen, that ye
 will go to your lady's bed, dame elaine, by whom ye gat galahad. ah,
 madam, said sir launcelot, never say ye so, for that i did was against my
 will. then, said the queen, look that ye come to me when i send for you.
 madam, said launcelot, i shall not fail you, but i shall be ready at your
 commandment. this bargain was soon done and made between them, but dame
 brisen knew it by her crafts, and told it to her lady, dame elaine. alas,
 said she, how shall i do? let me deal, said dame brisen, for i shall bring
 him by the hand even to your bed, and he shall ween that i am queen
 guenever's messenger. now well is me, said dame elaine, for all the world
 i love not so much as i do sir launcelot.
 chapter viii. how dame brisen by enchantment brought sir launcelot to dame
 elaine's bed, and how queen guenever rebuked him.
 so when time came that all folks were abed, dame brisen came to sir
 launcelot's bed's side and said: sir launcelot du lake, sleep you? my
 lady, queen guenever, lieth and awaiteth upon you. o my fair lady, said
 sir launcelot, i am ready to go with you where ye will have me. so sir
 launcelot threw upon him a long gown, and his sword in his hand; and then
 dame brisen took him by the finger and led him to her lady's bed, dame
 elaine; and then she departed and left them in bed together. wit you well
 the lady was glad, and so was sir launcelot, for he weened that he had had
 another in his arms.
 now leave we them kissing and clipping, as was kindly thing; and now speak
 we of queen guenever that sent one of her women unto sir launcelot's bed;
 and when she came there she found the bed cold, and he was away; so she
 came to the queen and told her all. alas, said the queen, where is that
 false knight become? then the queen was nigh out of her wit, and then she
 writhed and weltered as a mad woman, and might not sleep a four or five
 hours. then sir launcelot had a condition that he used of custom, he would
 clatter in his sleep, and speak oft of his lady, queen guenever. so as sir
 launcelot had waked as long as it had pleased him, then by course of kind
 he slept, and dame elaine both. and in his sleep he talked and clattered
 as a jay, of the love that had been betwixt queen guenever and him. and so
 as he talked so loud the queen heard him thereas she lay in her chamber;
 and when she heard him so clatter she was nigh wood and out of her mind,
 and for anger and pain wist not what to do. and then she coughed so loud
 that sir launcelot awaked, and he knew her hemming. and then he knew well
 that he lay not by the queen; and therewith he leapt out of his bed as he
 had been a wood man, in his shirt, and the queen met him in the floor; and
 thus she said: false traitor knight that thou art, look thou never abide
 in my court, and avoid my chamber, and not so hardy, thou false traitor
 knight that thou art, that ever thou come in my sight. alas, said sir
 launcelot; and therewith he took such an heartly sorrow at her words that
 he fell down to the floor in a swoon. and therewithal queen guenever
 departed. and when sir launcelot awoke of his swoon, he leapt out at a bay
 window into a garden, and there with thorns he was all to-scratched in his
 visage and his body; and so he ran forth he wist not whither, and was wild
 wood as ever was man; and so he ran two year, and never man might have
 grace to know him.
 chapter ix. how dame elaine was commanded by queen guenever to avoid the
 court, and how sir launcelot became mad.
 now turn we unto queen guenever and to the fair lady elaine, that when
 dame elaine heard the queen so to rebuke sir launcelot, and also she saw
 how he swooned, and how he leaped out at a bay window, then she said unto
 queen guenever: madam, ye are greatly to blame for sir launcelot, for now
 have ye lost him, for i saw and heard by his countenance that he is mad
 for ever. alas, madam, ye do great sin, and to yourself great dishonour,
 for ye have a lord of your own, and therefore it is your part to love him;
 for there is no queen in this world hath such another king as ye have.
 and, if ye were not, i might have the love of my lord sir launcelot; and
 cause i have to love him for he had my maidenhood, and by him i have borne
 a fair son, and his name is galahad, and he shall be in his time the best
 knight of the world. dame elaine, said the queen, when it is daylight i
 charge you and command you to avoid my court; and for the love ye owe unto
 sir launcelot discover not his counsel, for an ye do, it will be his
 death. as for that, said dame elaine, i dare undertake he is marred for
 ever, and that have ye made; for ye, nor i, are like to rejoice him; for
 he made the most piteous groans when he leapt out at yonder bay window
 that ever i heard man make. alas, said fair elaine, and alas, said the
 queen guenever, for now i wot well we have lost him for ever.
 so on the morn dame elaine took her leave to depart, and she would no
 longer abide. then king arthur brought her on her way with mo than an
 hundred knights through a forest. and by the way she told sir bors de
 ganis all how it betid that same night, and how sir launcelot leapt out at
 a window, araged out of his wit. alas, said sir bors, where is my lord,
 sir launcelot, become? sir, said elaine, i wot ne'er. alas, said sir bors,
 betwixt you both ye have destroyed that good knight. as for me, said dame
 elaine, i said never nor did never thing that should in any wise displease
 him, but with the rebuke that queen guenever gave him i saw him swoon to
 the earth; and when he awoke he took his sword in his hand, naked save his
 shirt, and leapt out at a window with the grisliest groan that ever i
 heard man make. now farewell, dame elaine, said sir bors, and hold my lord
 arthur with a tale as long as ye can, for i will turn again to queen
 guenever and give her a hete; and i require you, as ever ye will have my
 service, make good watch and espy if ever ye may see my lord sir
 launcelot. truly, said fair elaine, i shall do all that i may do, for as
 fain would i know and wit where he is become, as you, or any of his kin,
 or queen guenever; and cause great enough have i thereto as well as any
 other. and wit ye well, said fair elaine to sir bors, i would lose my life
 for him rather than he should be hurt; but alas, i cast me never for to
 see him, and the chief causer of this is dame guenever. madam, said dame
 brisen, the which had made the enchantment before betwixt sir launcelot
 and her, i pray you heartily, let sir bors depart, and hie him with all
 his might as fast as he may to seek sir launcelot, for i warn you he is
 clean out of his mind; and yet he shall be well holpen an but by miracle.
 then wept dame elaine, and so did sir bors de ganis; and so they departed,
 and sir bors rode straight unto queen guenever. and when she saw sir bors
 she wept as she were wood. fie on your weeping, said sir bors de ganis,
 for ye weep never but when there is no bote. alas, said sir bors, that
 ever sir launcelot's kin saw you, for now have ye lost the best knight of
 our blood, and he that was all our leader and our succour; and i dare say
 and make it good that all kings, christian nor heathen, may not find such
 a knight, for to speak of his nobleness and courtesy, with his beauty and
 his gentleness. alas, said sir bors, what shall we do that be of his
 blood? alas, said sir ector de maris. alas, said lionel.
 chapter x. what sorrow queen guenever made for sir launcelot, and how he
 was sought by knights of his kin.
 and when the queen heard them say so she fell to the earth in a dead
 swoon. and then sir bors took her up, and dawed her; and when she was
 awaked she kneeled afore the three knights, and held up both her hands,
 and besought them to seek him. and spare not for no goods but that he be
 found, for i wot he is out of his mind. and sir bors, sir ector, and sir
 lionel departed from the queen, for they might not abide no longer for
 sorrow. and then the queen sent them treasure enough for their expenses,
 and so they took their horses and their armour, and departed. and then
 they rode from country to country, in forests, and in wilderness, and in
 wastes; and ever they laid watch both at forests and at all manner of men
 as they rode, to hearken and spere after him, as he that was a naked man,
 in his shirt, with a sword in his hand. and thus they rode nigh a quarter
 of a year, endlong and overthwart, in many places, forests and wilderness,
 and oft-times were evil lodged for his sake; and yet for all their labour
 and seeking could they never hear word of him. and wit you well these
 three knights were passing sorry.
 then at the last sir bors and his fellows met with a knight that hight sir
 melion de tartare. now fair knight, said sir bors, whither be ye away? for
 they knew either other afore time. sir, said melion, i am in the way
 toward the court of king arthur. then we pray you, said sir bors, that ye
 will tell my lord arthur, and my lady, queen guenever, and all the
 fellowship of the round table, that we cannot in no wise hear tell where
 sir launcelot is become. then sir melion departed from them, and said that
 he would tell the king, and the queen, and all the fellowship-of the round
 table, as they had desired him. so when sir melion came to the court of
 king arthur he told the king, and the queen, and all the fellowship of the
 round table, what sir bors had said of sir launcelot. then sir gawaine,
 sir uwaine, sir sagramore le desirous, sir aglovale, and sir percivale de
 galis took upon them by the great desire of king arthur, and in especial
 by the queen, to seek throughout all england, wales, and scotland, to find
 sir launcelot, and with them rode eighteen knights mo to bear them
 fellowship; and wit ye well, they lacked no manner of spending; and so
 were they three and twenty knights.
 now turn we to sir launcelot, and speak we of his care and woe, and what
 pain he there endured; for cold, hunger, and thirst, he had plenty. and
 thus as these noble knights rode together, they by one assent departed,
 and then they rode by two, by three, and by four, and by five, and ever
 they assigned where they should meet. and so sir aglovale and sir
 percivale rode together unto their mother that was a queen in those days.
 and when she saw her two sons, for joy she wept tenderly. and then she
 said: ah, my dear sons, when your father was slain he left me four sons,
 of the which now be twain slain. and for the death of my noble son, sir
 lamorak, shall my heart never be glad. and then she kneeled down upon her
 knees to-fore aglovale and sir percivale, and besought them to abide at
 home with her. ah, sweet mother, said sir percivale, we may not, for we be
 come of king's blood of both parties, and therefore, mother, it is our
 kind to haunt arms and noble deeds. alas, my sweet sons, then she said,
 for your sakes i shall lose my liking and lust, and then wind and weather
 i may not endure, what for the death of your father, king pellinore, that
 was shamefully slain by the hands of sir gawaine, and his brother, sir
 gaheris: and they slew him not manly but by treason. ah, my dear sons,
 this is a piteous complaint for me of your father's death, considering
 also the death of sir lamorak, that of knighthood had but few fellows.
 now, my dear sons, have this in your mind. then there was but weeping and
 sobbing in the court when they should depart, and she fell a-swooning in
 midst of the court.
 chapter xi. how a servant of sir aglovale's was slain, and what vengeance
 sir aglovale and sir percivale did therefore.
 and when she was awaked she sent a squire after them with spending enough.
 and so when the squire had overtaken them, they would not suffer him to
 ride with them, but sent him home again to comfort their mother, praying
 her meekly of her blessing. and so this squire was benighted, and by
 misfortune he happened to come to a castle where dwelled a baron. and so
 when the squire was come into the castle, the lord asked him from whence
 he came, and whom he served. my lord, said the squire, i serve a good
 knight that is called sir aglovale: the squire said it to good intent,
 weening unto him to have been more forborne for sir aglovale's sake, than
 he had said he had served the queen, aglovale's mother. well, my fellow,
 said the lord of that castle, for sir aglovale's sake thou shalt have evil
 lodging, for sir aglovale slew my brother, and therefore thou shalt die on
 part of payment. and then that lord commanded his men to have him away and
 slay him; and so they did, and so pulled him out of the castle, and there
 they slew him without mercy.
 right so on the morn came sir aglovale and sir percivale riding by a
 churchyard, where men and women were busy, and beheld the dead squire, and
 they thought to bury him. what is there, said sir aglovale, that ye behold
 so fast? a good man stert forth and said: fair knight, here lieth a squire
 slain shamefully this night. how was he slain, fair fellow? said sir
 aglovale. my fair sir, said the man, the lord of this castle lodged this
 squire this night; and because he said he was servant unto a good knight
 that is with king arthur, his name is sir aglovale, therefore the lord
 commanded to slay him, and for this cause is he slain. gramercy, said sir
 aglovale, and ye shall see his death revenged lightly; for i am that same
 knight for whom this squire was slain.
 then sir aglovale called unto him sir percivale, and bade him alight
 lightly; and so they alighted both, and betook their horses to their men,
 and so they yede on foot into the castle. and all so soon as they were
 within the castle gate sir aglovale bade the porter: go thou unto thy lord
 and tell him that i am sir aglovale for whom this squire was slain this
 night. anon the porter told this to his lord, whose name was goodewin.
 anon he armed him, and then he came into the court and said: which of you
 is sir aglovale? here i am, said aglovale: for what cause slewest thou
 this night my mother's squire? i slew him, said sir goodewin, because of
 thee, for thou slewest my brother, sir gawdelin. as for thy brother, said
 sir aglovale, i avow it i slew him, for he was a false knight and a
 betrayer of ladies and of good knights; and for the death of my squire
 thou shalt die. i defy thee, said sir goodewin. then they lashed together
 as eagerly as it had been two lions, and sir percivale he fought with all
 the remnant that would fight. and within a while sir percivale had slain
 all that would withstand him; for sir percivale dealt so his strokes that
 were so rude that there durst no man abide him. and within a while sir
 aglovale had sir goodewin at the earth, and there he unlaced his helm, and
 struck off his head. and then they departed and took their horses; and
 then they let carry the dead squire unto a priory, and there they interred
 him.
 chapter xii. how sir pervivale departed secretly from his brother, and how
 he loosed a knight bound with a chain, and of other doings.
 and when this was done they rode into many countries, ever inquiring after
 sir launcelot, but never they could hear of him; and at the last they came
 to a castle that hight cardican, and there sir percivale and sir aglovale
 were lodged together. and privily about midnight sir percivale came to
 aglovale's squire and said: arise and make thee ready, for ye and i will
 ride away secretly. sir, said the squire, i would full fain ride with you
 where ye would have me, but an my lord, your brother, take me he will slay
 me. as for that care thou not, for i shall be thy warrant.
 and so sir percivale rode till it was after noon, and then he came upon a
 bridge of stone, and there he found a knight that was bound with a chain
 fast about the waist unto a pillar of stone. o fair knight, said that
 bound knight, i require thee loose me of my bonds. what knight are ye,
 said sir percivale, and for what cause are ye so bound? sir, i shall tell
 you, said that knight: i am a knight of the table round, and my name is
 sir persides; and thus by adventure i came this way, and here i lodged in
 this castle at the bridge foot, and therein dwelleth an uncourteous lady;
 and because she proffered me to be her paramour, and i refused her, she
 set her men upon me suddenly or ever i might come to my weapon; and thus
 they bound me, and here i wot well i shall die but if some man of worship
 break my bands. be ye of good cheer, said sir percivale, and because ye
 are a knight of the round table as well as i, i trust to god to break your
 bands. and therewith sir percivale pulled out his sword and struck at the
 chain with such a might that he cut a-two the chain, and through sir
 persides' hauberk and hurt him a little. o jesu, said sir persides, that
 was a mighty stroke as ever i felt one, for had not the chain been ye had
 slain me.
 and therewithal sir persides saw a knight coming out of a castle all that
 ever he might fling. beware, sir, said sir persides, yonder cometh a man
 that will have ado with you. let him come, said sir percivale. and so he
 met with that knight in midst of the bridge; and sir percivale gave him
 such a buffet that he smote him quite from his horse and over a part of
 the bridge, that, had not been a little vessel under the bridge, that
 knight had been drowned. and then sir percivale took the knight's horse
 and made sir persides to mount up him; and so they rode unto the castle,
 and bade the lady deliver sir persides' servants, or else he would slay
 all that ever he found; and so for fear she delivered them all. then was
 sir percivale ware of a lady that stood in that tower. ah, madam, said sir
 percivale, what use and custom is that in a lady to destroy good knights
 but if they will be your paramour? forsooth this is a shameful custom of a
 lady, and if i had not a great matter in my hand i should fordo your evil
 customs.
 and so sir persides brought sir percivale unto his own castle, and there
 he made him great cheer all that night. and on the morn, when sir
 percivale had heard mass and broken his fast, he bade sir persides ride
 unto king arthur: and tell the king how that ye met with me; and tell my
 brother, sir aglovale, how i rescued you; and bid him seek not after me,
 for i am in the quest to seek sir launcelot du lake, and though he seek me
 he shall not find me; and tell him i will never see him, nor the court,
 till i have found sir launcelot. also tell sir kay the seneschal, and to
 sir mordred, that i trust to jesu to be of as great worthiness as either
 of them, for tell them i shall never forget their mocks and scorns that
 they did to me that day that i was made knight; and tell them i will never
 see that court till men speak more worship of me than ever men did of any
 of them both. and so sir persides departed from sir percivale, and then he
 rode unto king arthur, and told there of sir percivale. and when sir
 aglovale heard him speak of his brother sir percivale, he said: he
 departed from me unkindly.
 chapter xiii. how sir percivale met with sir ector, and how they fought
 long, and each had almost slain other.
 sir, said sir persides, on my life he shall prove a noble knight as any
 now is living. and when he saw sir kay and sir mordred, sir persides said
 thus: my fair lords both, sir percivale greeteth you well both, and he
 sent you word by me that he trusteth to god or ever he come to the court
 again to be of as great noblesse as ever were ye both, and mo men to speak
 of his noblesse than ever they did of you. it may well be, said sir kay
 and sir mordred, but at that time when he was made knight he was full
 unlike to prove a good knight. as for that, said king arthur, he must
 needs prove a good knight, for his father and his brethren were noble
 knights
 and now will we turn unto sir percivale that rode long; and in a forest he
 met a knight with a broken shield and a broken helm; and as soon as either
 saw other readily they made them ready to joust, and so hurtled together
 with all the might of their horses, and met together so hard, that sir
 percivale was smitten to the earth. and then sir percivale arose lightly,
 and cast his shield on his shoulder and drew his sword, and bade the other
 knight alight, and do we battle unto the uttermost. will ye more? said
 that knight. and therewith he alighted, and put his horse from him; and
 then they came together an easy pace, and there they lashed together with
 noble swords, and sometime they struck and sometime they foined, and
 either gave other many great wounds. thus they fought near half a day, and
 never rested but right little, and there was none of them both that had
 less wounds than fifteen, and they bled so much that it was marvel they
 stood on their feet. but this knight that fought with sir percivale was a
 proved knight and a wise-fighting knight, and sir percivale was young and
 strong, not knowing in fighting as the other was.
 then sir percivale spoke first, and said: sir knight, hold thy hand a
 while still, for we have fought for a simple matter and quarrel overlong,
 and therefore i require thee tell me thy name, for i was never or this
 time matched. so god me help, said that knight, and never or this time was
 there never knight that wounded me so sore as thou hast done, and yet have
 i fought in many battles; and now shalt thou wit that i am a knight of the
 table round, and my name is sir ector de maris, brother unto the good
 knight, sir launcelot du lake. alas, said sir percivale, and my name is
 sir percivale de galis that hath made my quest to seek sir launcelot, and
 now i am siker that i shall never finish my quest, for ye have slain me
 with your hands. it is not so, said sir ector, for i am slain by your
 hands, and may not live. therefore i require you, said sir ector unto sir
 percivale, ride ye hereby to a priory, and bring me a priest that i may
 receive my saviour, for i may not live. and when ye come to the court of
 king arthur tell not my brother, sir launcelot, how that ye slew me, for
 then he would be your mortal enemy, but ye may say that i was slain in my
 quest as i sought him. alas, said sir percivale, ye say that never will
 be, for i am so faint for bleeding that i may unnethe stand, how should i
 then take my horse?
 chapter xiv. how by miracle they were both made whole by the coming of the
 holy vessel of sangreal.
 then they made both great dole out of measure. this will not avail, said
 sir percivale. and then he kneeled down and made his prayer devoutly unto
 almighty jesu, for he was one of the best knights of the world that at
 that time was, in whom the very faith stood most in. right so there came
 by the holy vessel of the sangreal with all manner of sweetness and
 savour; but they could not readily see who that bare that vessel, but sir
 percivale had a glimmering of the vessel and of the maiden that bare it,
 for he was a perfect clean maiden; and forthwithal they both were as whole
 of hide and limb as ever they were in their life-days: then they gave
 thankings to god with great mildness. o jesu, said sir percivale, what may
 this mean, that we be thus healed, and right now we were at the point of
 dying? i wot full well, said sir ector, what it is; it is an holy vessel
 that is borne by a maiden, and therein is part of the holy blood of our
 lord jesu christ, blessed mote he be. but it may not be seen, said sir
 ector, but if it be by a perfect man. so god me help, said sir percivale,
 i saw a damosel, as me thought, all in white, with a vessel in both her
 hands, and forthwithal i was whole.
 so then they took their horses and their harness, and amended their
 harness as well as they might that was broken; and so they mounted upon
 their horses, and rode talking together. and there sir ector de maris told
 sir percivale how he had sought his brother, sir launcelot, long, and
 never could hear witting of him: in many strange adventures have i been in
 this quest. and so either told other of their adventures.
here endeth the eleventh book. and here followeth the twelfth book.
 chapter i. how sir launcelot in his madness took a sword and fought with a
 knight, and leapt in a bed.
 and now leave we of a while of sir ector and of sir percivale, and speak
 we of sir launcelot that suffered and endured many sharp showers, that
 ever ran wild wood from place to place, and lived by fruit and such as he
 might get, and drank water two year; and other clothing had he but little
 but his shirt and his breech. thus as sir launcelot wandered here and
 there he came in a fair meadow where he found a pavilion; and there by,
 upon a tree, there hung a white shield, and two swords hung thereby, and
 two spears leaned there by a tree. and when sir launcelot saw the swords,
 anon he leapt to the one sword, and took it in his hand, and drew it out.
 and then he lashed at the shield, that all the meadow rang of the dints,
 that he gave such a noise as ten knights had foughten together.
 then came forth a dwarf, and leapt unto sir launcelot, and would have had
 the sword out of his hand. and then sir launcelot took him by the both
 shoulders and threw him to the ground upon his neck, that he had almost
 broken his neck; and therewithal the dwarf cried help. then came forth a
 likely knight, and well apparelled in scarlet furred with minever. and
 anon as he saw sir launcelot he deemed that he should be out of his wit.
 and then he said with fair speech: good man, lay down that sword, for as
 meseemeth thou hadst more need of sleep and of warm clothes than to wield
 that sword. as for that, said sir launcelot, come not too nigh, for an
 thou do, wit thou well i will slay thee.
 and when the knight of the pavilion saw that, he stert backward within the
 pavilion. and then the dwarf armed him lightly; and so the knight thought
 by force and might to take the sword from sir launcelot, and so he came
 stepping out; and when sir launcelot saw him come so all armed with his
 sword in his hand, then sir launcelot flew to him with such a might, and
 hit him upon the helm such a buffet, that the stroke troubled his brains,
 and therewith the sword brake in three. and the knight fell to the earth
 as he had been dead, the blood brasting out of his mouth, the nose, and
 the ears. and then sir launcelot ran into the pavilion, and rushed even
 into the warm bed; and there was a lady in that bed, and she gat her
 smock, and ran out of the pavilion. and when she saw her lord lie at the
 ground like to be dead, then she cried and wept as she had been mad. then
 with her noise the knight awaked out of his swoon, and looked up weakly
 with his eyes; and then he asked her, where was that mad man that had
 given him such a buffet: for such a buffet had i never of man's hand. sir,
 said the dwarf, it is not worship to hurt him, for he is a man out of his
 wit; and doubt ye not he hath been a man of great worship, and for some
 heartly sorrow that he hath taken, he is fallen mad; and me beseemeth,
 said the dwarf, he resembleth much unto sir launcelot, for him i saw at
 the great tournament beside lonazep. jesu defend, said that knight, that
 ever that noble knight, sir launcelot, should be in such a plight; but
 whatsomever he be, said that knight, harm will i none do him: and this
 knight's name was bliant. then he said unto the dwarf: go thou fast on
 horseback, unto my brother sir selivant, that is at the castle blank, and
 tell him of mine adventure, and bid him bring with him an horse litter,
 and then will we bear this knight unto my castle.
 chapter ii. how sir lancelot was carried in an horse litter, and how sir
 launcelot rescued sir bliant, his host.
 so the dwarf rode fast, and he came again and brought sir selivant with
 him, and six men with an horse litter; and so they took up the feather bed
 with sir launcelot, and so carried all away with them unto the castle
 blank, and he never awaked till he was within the castle. and then they
 bound his hands and his feet, and gave him good meats and good drinks, and
 brought him again to his strength and his fairness; but in his wit they
 could not bring him again, nor to know himself. thus was sir launcelot
 there more than a year and a half, honestly arrayed and fair faren withal.
 then upon a day this lord of that castle, sir bliant, took his arms, on
 horseback, with a spear, to seek adventures. and as he rode in a forest
 there met with him two knights adventurous, the one was breuse saunce
 pité, and his brother, sir bertelot; and these two ran both at once upon
 sir bliant, and brake their spears upon his body. and then they drew out
 swords and made great battle, and fought long together. but at the last
 sir bliant was sore wounded, and felt himself faint; and then he fled on
 horseback toward his castle. and as they came hurling under the castle
 whereas sir launcelot lay in a window, [he] saw how two knights laid upon
 sir bliant with their swords. and when sir launcelot saw that, yet as wood
 as he was he was sorry for his lord, sir bliant. and then sir launcelot
 brake the chains from his legs and off his arms, and in the breaking he
 hurt his hands sore; and so sir launcelot ran out at a postern, and there
 he met with the two knights that chased sir bliant; and there he pulled
 down sir bertelot with his bare hands from his horse, and therewithal he
 wrothe his sword out of his hand; and so he leapt unto sir breuse, and
 gave him such a buffet upon the head that he tumbled backward over his
 horse's croup. and when sir bertelot saw there his brother have such a
 fall, he gat a spear in his hand, and would have run sir launcelot
 through: that saw sir bliant, and struck off the hand of sir bertelot. and
 then sir breuse and sir bertelot gat their horses and fled away.
 when sir selivant came and saw what sir launcelot had done for his
 brother, then he thanked god, and so did his brother, that ever they did
 him any good. but when sir bliant saw that sir launcelot was hurt with the
 breaking of his irons, then was he heavy that ever he bound him. bind him
 no more, said sir selivant, for he is happy and gracious. then they made
 great joy of sir launcelot, and they bound him no more; and so he abode
 there an half year and more. and on the morn early sir launcelot was ware
 where came a great boar with many hounds nigh him. but the boar was so big
 there might no hounds tear him; and the hunters came after, blowing their
 horns, both upon horseback and some upon foot; and then sir launcelot was
 ware where one alighted and tied his horse to a tree, and leaned his spear
 against the tree.
 chapter iii. how sir launcelot fought against a boar and slew him, and how
 he was hurt, and brought unto an hermitage.
 so came sir launcelot and found the horse bounden till a tree, and a spear
 leaning against a tree, and a sword tied to the saddle bow; and then sir
 launcelot leapt into the saddle and gat that spear in his hand, and then
 he rode after the boar; and then sir launcelot was ware where the boar set
 his arse to a tree fast by an hermitage. then sir launcelot ran at the
 boar with his spear, and therewith the boar turned him nimbly, and rove
 out the lungs and the heart of the horse, so that launcelot fell to the
 earth; and, or ever sir launcelot might get from the horse, the boar rove
 him on the brawn of the thigh up to the hough bone. and then sir launcelot
 was wroth, and up he gat upon his feet, and drew his sword, and he smote
 off the boar's head at one stroke. and therewithal came out the hermit,
 and saw him have such a wound. then the hermit came to sir launcelot and
 bemoaned him, and would have had him home unto his hermitage; but when sir
 launcelot heard him speak, he was so wroth with his wound that he ran upon
 the hermit to have slain him, and the hermit ran away. and when sir
 launcelot might not overget him, he threw his sword after him, for sir
 launcelot might go no further for bleeding; then the hermit turned again,
 and asked sir launcelot how he was hurt. fellow, said sir launcelot, this
 boar hath bitten me sore. then come with me, said the hermit, and i shall
 heal you. go thy way, said sir launcelot, and deal not with me.
 then the hermit ran his way, and there he met with a good knight with many
 men. sir, said the hermit, here is fast by my place the goodliest man that
 ever i saw, and he is sore wounded with a boar, and yet he hath slain the
 boar. but well i wot, said the hermit, and he be not holpen, that goodly
 man shall die of that wound, and that were great pity. then that knight at
 the desire of the hermit gat a cart, and in that cart that knight put the
 boar and sir launcelot, for sir launcelot was so feeble that they might
 right easily deal with him; and so sir launcelot was brought unto the
 hermitage, and there the hermit healed him of his wound. but the hermit
 might not find sir launcelot's sustenance, and so he impaired and waxed
 feeble, both of his body and of his wit: for the default of his sustenance
 he waxed more wooder than he was aforehand.
 and then upon a day sir launcelot ran his way into the forest; and by
 adventure he came to the city of corbin, where dame elaine was, that bare
 galahad, sir launcelot's son. and so when he was entered into the town he
 ran through the town to the castle; and then all the young men of that
 city ran after sir launcelot, and there they threw turves at him, and gave
 him many sad strokes. and ever as sir launcelot might overreach any of
 them, he threw them so that they would never come in his hands no more;
 for of some he brake the legs and the arms, and so fled into the castle;
 and then came out knights and squires and rescued sir launcelot. and when
 they beheld him and looked upon his person, they thought they saw never so
 goodly a man. and when they saw so many wounds upon him, all they deemed
 that he had been a man of worship. and then they ordained him clothes to
 his body, and straw underneath him, and a little house. and then every day
 they would throw him meat, and set him drink, but there was but few would
 bring him meat to his hands.
 chapter iv. how sir launcelot was known by dame elaine, and was borne into
 a chamber and after healed by the sangreal.
 so it befell that king pelles had a nephew, his name was castor; and so he
 desired of the king to be made knight, and so at the request of this
 castor the king made him knight at the feast of candlemas. and when sir
 castor was made knight, that same day he gave many gowns. and then sir
 castor sent for the fool—that was sir launcelot. and when he was
 come afore sir castor, he gave sir launcelot a robe of scarlet and all
 that longed unto him. and when sir launcelot was so arrayed like a knight,
 he was the seemliest man in all the court, and none so well made. so when
 he saw his time he went into the garden, and there sir launcelot laid him
 down by a well and slept. and so at-after noon dame elaine and her maidens
 came into the garden to play them; and as they roamed up and down one of
 dame elaine's maidens espied where lay a goodly man by the well sleeping,
 and anon showed him to dame elaine. peace, said dame elaine, and say no
 word: and then she brought dame elaine where he lay. and when that she
 beheld him, anon she fell in remembrance of him, and knew him verily for
 sir launcelot; and therewithal she fell a-weeping so heartily that she
 sank even to the earth; and when she had thus wept a great while, then she
 arose and called her maidens and said she was sick.
 and so she yede out of the garden, and she went straight to her father,
 and there she took him apart by herself; and then she said: o father, now
 have i need of your help, and but if that ye help me farewell my good days
 for ever. what is that, daughter? said king pelles. sir, she said, thus is
 it: in your garden i went for to sport, and there, by the well, i found
 sir launcelot du lake sleeping. i may not believe that, said king pelles.
 sir, she said, truly he is there, and meseemeth he should be distract out
 of his wit. then hold you still, said the king, and let me deal. then the
 king called to him such as he most trusted, a four persons, and dame
 elaine, his daughter. and when they came to the well and beheld sir
 launcelot, anon dame brisen knew him. sir, said dame brisen, we must be
 wise how we deal with him, for this knight is out of his mind, and if we
 awake him rudely what he will do we all know not; but ye shall abide, and
 i shall throw such an enchantment upon him that he shall not awake within
 the space of an hour; and so she did.
 then within a little while after, the king commanded that all people
 should avoid, that none should be in that way thereas the king would come.
 and so when this was done, these four men and these ladies laid hand on
 sir launcelot, and so they bare him into a tower, and so into a chamber
 where was the holy vessel of the sangreal, and by force sir launcelot was
 laid by that holy vessel; and there came an holy man and unhilled that
 vessel, and so by miracle and by virtue of that holy vessel sir launcelot
 was healed and recovered. and when that he was awaked he groaned and
 sighed, and complained greatly that he was passing sore.
 chapter v. how sir launcelot, after that he was whole and had his mind, he
 was ashamed, and how that elaine desired a castle for him.
 and when sir launcelot saw king pelles and elaine, he waxed ashamed and
 said thus: o lord jesu, how came i here? for god's sake, my lord, let me
 wit how i came here. sir, said dame elaine, into this country ye came like
 a madman, clean out of your wit, and here have ye been kept as a fool; and
 no creature here knew what ye were, until by fortune a maiden of mine
 brought me unto you whereas ye lay sleeping by a well, and anon as i
 verily beheld you i knew you. and then i told my father, and so were ye
 brought afore this holy vessel, and by the virtue of it thus were ye
 healed. o jesu, mercy, said sir launcelot; if this be sooth, how many
 there be that know of my woodness! so god me help, said elaine, no more
 but my father, and i, and dame brisen. now for christ's love, said sir
 launcelot, keep it in counsel, and let no man know it in the world, for i
 am sore ashamed that i have been thus miscarried; for i am banished out of
 the country of logris for ever, that is for to say the country of england.
 and so sir launcelot lay more than a fortnight or ever that he might stir
 for soreness. and then upon a day he said unto dame elaine these words:
 lady elaine, for your sake i have had much travail, care, and anguish, it
 needeth not to rehearse it, ye know how. notwithstanding i know well i
 have done foul to you when that i drew my sword to you, to have slain you,
 upon the morn when i had lain with you. and all was the cause, that ye and
 dame brisen made me for to lie by you maugre mine head; and as ye say,
 that night galahad your son was begotten. that is truth, said dame elaine.
 now will ye for my love, said sir launcelot, go unto your father and get
 me a place of him wherein i may dwell? for in the court of king arthur may
 i never come. sir, said dame elaine, i will live and die with you, and
 only for your sake; and if my life might not avail you and my death might
 avail you, wit you well i would die for your sake. and i will go to my
 father and i am sure there is nothing that i can desire of him but i shall
 have it. and where ye be, my lord sir launcelot, doubt ye not but i will
 be with you with all the service that i may do. so forthwithal she went to
 her father and said, sir, my lord, sir launcelot, desireth to be here by
 you in some castle of yours. well daughter, said the king, sith it is his
 desire to abide in these marches he shall be in the castle of bliant, and
 there shall ye be with him, and twenty of the fairest ladies that be in
 the country, and they shall all be of the great blood, and ye shall have
 ten knights with you; for, daughter, i will that ye wit we all be honoured
 by the blood of sir launcelot.
 chapter vi. how sir launcelot came into the joyous isle, and there he
 named himself le chevaler mal fet.
 then went dame elaine unto sir launcelot, and told him all how her father
 had devised for him and her. then came the knight sir castor, that was
 nephew unto kong pelles, unto sir launcelot, and asked him what was his
 name. sir, said sir launcelot, my name is le chevaler mal fet, that is to
 say the knight that hath trespassed. sir, said sir castor, it may well be
 so, but ever meseemeth your name should be sir launcelot du lake, for or
 now i have seen you. sir, said launcelot, ye are not as a gentle knight: i
 put case my name were sir launcelot, and that it list me not to discover
 my name, what should it grieve you here to keep my counsel, and ye be not
 hurt thereby? but wit thou well an ever it lie in my power i shall grieve
 you, and that i promise you truly. then sir castor kneeled down and
 besought sir launcelot of mercy: for i shall never utter what ye be, while
 that ye be in these parts. then sir launcelot pardoned him.
 and then, after this, king pelles with ten knights, and dame elaine, and
 twenty ladies, rode unto the castle of bliant that stood in an island
 beclosed in iron, with a fair water deep and large. and when they were
 there sir launcelot let call it the joyous isle; and there was he called
 none otherwise but le chevaler mal fet, the knight that hath trespassed.
 then sir launcelot let make him a shield all of sable, and a queen crowned
 in the midst, all of silver, and a knight clean armed kneeling afore her.
 and every day once, for any mirths that all the ladies might make him, he
 would once every day look toward the realm of logris, where king arthur
 and queen guenever was. and then would he fall upon a weeping as his heart
 should to-brast.
 so it fell that time sir launcelot heard of a jousting fast by his castle,
 within three leagues. then he called unto him a dwarf, and he bade him go
 unto that jousting. and or ever the knights depart, look thou make there a
 cry, in hearing of all the knights, that there is one knight in the joyous
 isle, that is the castle of bliant, and say his name is le chevaler mal
 fet, that will joust against knights that will come. and who that putteth
 that knight to the worse shall have a fair maid and a gerfalcon.
 chapter vii. of a great tourneying in the joyous isle, and how sir
 pervivale and sir ector came thither, and sir percivale fought with him.
 so when this cry was made, unto joyous isle drew knights to the number of
 five hundred; and wit ye well there was never seen in arthur's days one
 knight that did so much deeds of arms as sir launcelot did three days
 together; for as the book maketh truly mention, he had the better of all
 the five hundred knights, and there was not one slain of them. and after
 that sir launcelot made them all a great feast.
 and in the meanwhile came sir percivale de galis and sir ector de maris
 under that castle that was called the joyous isle. and as they beheld that
 gay castle they would have gone to that castle, but they might not for the
 broad water, and bridge could they find none. then they saw on the other
 side a lady with a sperhawk on her hand, and sir percivale called unto
 her, and asked that lady who was in that castle. fair knights, she said,
 here within this castle is the fairest lady in this land, and her name is
 elaine. also we have in this castle the fairest knight and the mightiest
 man that is i dare say living, and he called himself le chevaler mal fet.
 how came he into these marches? said sir percivale. truly, said the
 damosel, he came into this country like a mad man, with dogs and boys
 chasing him through the city of corbin, and by the holy vessel of the
 sangreal he was brought into his wit again; but he will not do battle with
 no knight, but by underne or by noon. and if ye list to come into the
 castle, said the lady, ye must ride unto the further side of the castle
 and there shall ye find a vessel that will bear you and your horse. then
 they departed, and came unto the vessel. and then sir percivale alighted,
 and said to sir ector de maris: ye shall abide me here until that i wit
 what manner a knight he is; for it were shame unto us, inasmuch as he is
 but one knight, an we should both do battle with him. do ye as ye list,
 said sir ector, and here i shall abide you until that i hear of you
 then passed sir percivale the water, and when he came to the castle gate
 he bade the porter: go thou to the good knight within the castle, and tell
 him here is come an errant knight to joust with him. sir, said the porter,
 ride ye within the castle, and there is a common place for jousting, that
 lords and ladies may behold you. so anon as sir launcelot had warning he
 was soon ready; and there sir percivale and sir launcelot encountered with
 such a might, and their spears were so rude, that both the horses and the
 knights fell to the earth. then they avoided their horses, and flang out
 noble swords, and hewed away cantels of their shields, and hurtled
 together with their shields like two boars, and either wounded other
 passing sore. at the last sir percivale spake first when they had foughten
 there more than two hours. fair knight, said sir percivale, i require thee
 tell me thy name, for i met never with such a knight. sir, said sir
 launcelot, my name is le chevaler mal fet. now tell me your name, said sir
 launcelot, i require you, gentle knight. truly, said sir percivale, my
 name is sir percivale de galis, that was brother unto the good knight, sir
 lamorak de galis, and king pellinore was our father, and sir aglovale is
 my brother. alas, said sir launcelot, what have i done to fight with you
 that art a knight of the round table, that sometime was your fellow?
 chapter vili. how each of them knew other, and of their great courtesy,
 and how his brother sir ector came unto him, and of their joy.
 and therewithal sir launcelot kneeled down upon his knees, and threw away
 his shield and his sword from him. when sir percivale saw him do so he
 marvelled what he meant. and then thus he said: sir knight, whatsomever
 thou be, i require thee upon the high order of knighthood, tell me thy
 true name. then he said: so god me help, my name is sir launcelot du lake,
 king ban's son of benoy. alas, said sir percivale, what have i done? i was
 sent by the queen for to seek you, and so i have sought you nigh this two
 year, and yonder is sir ector de maris, your brother abideth me on the
 other side of the yonder water. now for god's sake, said sir percivale,
 forgive me mine offences that i have here done. it is soon forgiven, said
 sir launcelot.
 then sir percivale sent for sir ector de maris, and when sir launcelot had
 a sight of him, he ran unto him and took him in his arms; and then sir
 ector kneeled down, and either wept upon other, that all had pity to
 behold them. then came dame elaine and she there made them great cheer as
 might lie in her power; and there she told sir ector and sir percivale how
 and in what manner sir launcelot came into that country, and how he was
 healed; and there it was known how long sir launcelot was with sir bliant
 and with sir selivant, and how he first met with them, and how he departed
 from them because of a boar; and how the hermit healed sir launcelot of
 his great wound, and how that he came to corbin.
 chapter ix. how sir bors and sir lionel came to king brandegore, and how
 sir bors took his son helin le blank, and of sir launcelot.
 now leave we sir launcelot in the joyous isle with the lady dame elaine,
 and sir percivale and sir ector playing with them, and turn we to sir bors
 de ganis and sir lionel, that had sought sir launcelot nigh by the space
 of two year, and never could they hear of him. and as they thus rode, by
 adventure they came to the house of brandegore, and there sir bors was
 well known, for he had gotten a child upon the king's daughter fifteen
 year to-fore, and his name was helin le blank. and when sir bors saw that
 child it liked him passing well. and so those knights had good cheer of
 the king brandegore. and on the morn sir bors came afore king brandegore
 and said: here is my son helin le blank, that as it is said he is my son;
 and sith it is so, i will that ye wit that i will have him with me unto
 the court of king arthur. sir, said the king, ye may well take him with
 you, but he is over tender of age. as for that, said sir bors, i will have
 him with me, and bring him to the house of most worship of the world. so
 when sir bors should depart there was made great sorrow for the departing
 of helin le blank, and great weeping was there made. but sir bors and sir
 lionel departed, and within a while they came to camelot, where was king
 arthur. and when king arthur understood that helin le blank was sir bors'
 son, and nephew unto king brandegore, then king arthur let him make knight
 of the round table; and so he proved a good knight and an adventurous.
 now will we turn to our matter of sir launcelot. it befell upon a day sir
 ector and sir percivale came to sir launcelot and asked him what he would
 do, and whether he would go with them unto king arthur or not. nay, said
 sir launcelot, that may not be by no mean, for i was so entreated at the
 court that i cast me never to come there more. sir, said sir ector, i am
 your brother, and ye are the man in the world that i love most; and if i
 understood that it were your disworship, ye may understand i would never
 counsel you thereto; but king arthur and all his knights, and in especial
 queen guenever, made such dole and sorrow that it was marvel to hear and
 see. and ye must remember the great worship and renown that ye be of, how
 that ye have been more spoken of than any other knight that is now living;
 for there is none that beareth the name now but ye and sir tristram.
 therefore brother, said sir ector, make you ready to ride to the court
 with us, and i dare say there was never knight better welcome to the court
 than ye; and i wot well and can make it good, said sir ector, it hath cost
 my lady, the queen, twenty thousand pound the seeking of you. well
 brother, said sir launcelot, i will do after your counsel, and ride with
 you.
 so then they took their horses and made them ready, and took their leave
 at king pelles and at dame elaine. and when sir launcelot should depart
 dame elaine made great sorrow. my lord, sir launcelot, said dame elaine,
 at this same feast of pentecost shall your son and mine, galahad, be made
 knight, for he is fully now fifteen winter old. do as ye list, said sir
 launcelot; god give him grace to prove a good knight. as for that, said
 dame elaine, i doubt not he shall prove the best man of his kin except
 one. then shall he be a man good enough, said sir launcelot.
 chapter x. how sir launcelot with sir percivale and sir ector came to the
 court, and of the great joy of him.
 then they departed, and within five days' journey they came to camelot,
 that is called in english, winchester. and when sir launcelot was come
 among them, the king and all the knights made great joy of him. and there
 sir percivale de galis and sir ector de maris began and told the whole
 adventures: that sir launcelot had been out of his mind the time of his
 absence, and how he called himself le chevaler mal fet, the knight that
 had trespassed; and in three days sir launcelot smote down five hundred
 knights. and ever as sir ector and sir percivale told these tales of sir
 launcelot, queen guenever wept as she should have died. then the queen
 made great cheer. o jesu, said king arthur, i marvel for what cause ye,
 sir launcelot, went out of your mind. i and many others deem it was for
 the love of fair elaine, the daughter of king pelles, by whom ye are
 noised that ye have gotten a child, and his name is galahad, and men say
 he shall do marvels. my lord, said sir launcelot, if i did any folly i
 have that i sought. and therewithal the king spake no more. but all sir
 launcelot's kin knew for whom he went out of his mind. and then there were
 great feasts made and great joy; and many great lords and ladies, when
 they heard that sir launcelot was come to the court again, they made great
 joy.
 chapter xi. how la beale isoud counselled sir tristram to go unto the
 court, to the great feast of pentecost.
 now will we leave off this matter, and speak we of sir tristram, and of
 sir palomides that was the saracen unchristened. when sir tristram was
 come home unto joyous gard from his adventures, all this while that sir
 launcelot was thus missed, two year and more, sir tristram bare the renown
 through all the realm of logris, and many strange adventures befell him,
 and full well and manly and worshipfully he brought them to an end. so
 when he was come home la beale isoud told him of the great feast that
 should be at pentecost next following, and there she told him how sir
 launcelot had been missed two year, and all that while he had been out of
 his mind, and how he was holpen by the holy vessel, the sangreal. alas,
 said sir tristram, that caused some debate betwixt him and queen guenever.
 sir, said dame isoud, i know it all, for queen guenever sent me a letter
 in the which she wrote me all how it was, for to require you to seek him.
 and now, blessed be god, said la beale isoud, he is whole and sound and
 come again to the court.
 thereof am i glad, said sir tristram, and now shall ye and i make us
 ready, for both ye and i will be at the feast. sir, said isoud, an it
 please you i will not be there, for through me ye be marked of many good
 knights, and that caused you to have much more labour for my sake than
 needeth you. then will i not be there, said sir tristram, but if ye be
 there. god defend, said la beale isoud, for then shall i be spoken of
 shame among all queens and ladies of estate; for ye that are called one of
 the noblest knights of the world, and ye a knight of the round table, how
 may ye be missed at that feast? what shall be said among all knights? see
 how sir tristram hunteth, and hawketh, and cowereth within a castle with
 his lady, and forsaketh your worship. alas, shall some say, it is pity
 that ever he was made knight, or that ever he should have the love of a
 lady. also what shall queens and ladies say of me? it is pity that i have
 my life, that i will hold so noble a knight as ye are from his worship. so
 god me help, said sir tristram unto la beale isoud, it is passing well
 said of you and nobly counselled; and now i well understand that ye love
 me; and like as ye have counselled me i will do a part thereafter. but
 there shall no man nor child ride with me, but myself. and so will i ride
 on tuesday next coming, and no more harness of war but my spear and my
 sword.
 chapter xii. how sir tristram departed unarmed and met with sir palomides,
 and how they smote each other, and how sir palomides forbare him.
 and so when the day came sir tristram took his leave at la beale isoud,
 and she sent with him four knights, and within half a mile he sent them
 again: and within a mile after sir tristram saw afore him where sir
 palomides had stricken down a knight, and almost wounded him to the death.
 then sir tristram repented him that he was not armed, and then he hoved
 still. with that sir palomides knew sir tristram, and cried on high: sir
 tristram, now be we met, for or we depart we will redress our old sores.
 as for that, said sir tristram, there was yet never christian man might
 make his boast that ever i fled from him; and wit ye well, sir palomides,
 thou that art a saracen shall never make thy boast that sir tristram de
 liones shall flee from thee. and therewith sir tristram made his horse to
 run, and with all his might he came straight upon sir palomides, and brast
 his spear upon him an hundred pieces. and forthwithal sir tristram drew
 his sword. and then he turned his horse and struck at palomides six great
 strokes upon his helm; and then sir palomides stood still, and beheld sir
 tristram, and marvelled of his woodness, and of his folly. and then sir
 palomides said to himself: an sir tristram were armed, it were hard to
 cease him of this battle, and if i turn again and slay him i am ashamed
 wheresomever that i go.
 then sir tristram spake and said: thou coward knight, what castest thou to
 do; why wilt thou not do battle with me? for have thou no doubt i shall
 endure all thy malice. ah, sir tristram, said palomides, full well thou
 wottest i may not fight with thee for shame, for thou art here naked and i
 am armed, and if i slay thee, dishonour shall be mine. and well thou
 wottest, said sir palomides to sir tristram, i know thy strength and thy
 hardiness to endure against a good knight. that is truth, said sir
 tristram, i understand thy valiantness well. ye say well, said sir
 palomides; now, i require you, tell me a question that i shall say to you.
 tell me what it is, said sir tristram, and i shall answer you the truth,
 as god me help. i put case, said sir palomides, that ye were armed at all
 rights as well as i am, and i naked as ye be, what would you do to me now,
 by your true knighthood? ah, said sir tristram, now i understand thee
 well, sir palomides, for now must i say mine own judgment, and as god me
 bless, that i shall say shall not be said for no fear that i have of thee.
 but this is all: wit sir palomides, as at this time thou shouldest depart
 from me, for i would not have ado with thee. no more will i, said
 palomides, and therefore ride forth on thy way. as for that i may choose,
 said sir tristram, either to ride or to abide. but sir palomides, said sir
 tristram, i marvel of one thing, that thou that art so good a knight, that
 thou wilt not be christened, and thy brother, sir safere, hath been
 christened many a day.
 chapter xiii. how that sir tristram gat him harness of a knight which was
 hurt, and how he overthrew sir palomides.
 as for that, said sir palomides, i may not yet be christened for one avow
 that i have made many years agone; howbeit in my heart i believe in jesu
 christ and his mild mother mary; but i have but one battle to do, and when
 that is done i will be baptised with a good will. by my head, said
 tristram, as for one battle thou shalt not seek it no longer. for god
 defend, said sir tristram, that through my default thou shouldst longer
 live thus a saracen, for yonder is a knight that ye, sir palomides, have
 hurt and smitten down. now help me that i were armed in his armour, and i
 shall soon fulfil thine avows. as ye will, said palomides, so it shall be.
 so they rode both unto that knight that sat upon a bank, and then sir
 tristram saluted him, and he weakly saluted him again. sir knight, said
 sir tristram, i require you tell me your right name. sir, he said, my name
 is sir galleron of galway, and knight of the table round. so god me help,
 said sir tristram, i am right heavy of your hurts; but this is all, i must
 pray you to lend me all your whole armour, for ye see i am unarmed, and i
 must do battle with this knight. sir, said the hurt knight, ye shall have
 it with a good will; but ye must beware, for i warn you that knight is
 wight. sir, said galleron, i pray you tell me your name, and what is that
 knight's name that hath beaten me. sir, as for my name it is sir tristram
 de liones, and as for the knight's name that hath hurt you is sir
 palomides, brother to the good knight sir safere, and yet is sir palomides
 unchristened. alas, said sir galleron, that is pity that so good a knight
 and so noble a man of arms should be unchristened. so god me help, said
 sir tristram, either he shall slay me or i him but that he shall be
 christened or ever we depart in-sunder. my lord sir tristram, said sir
 galleron, your renown and worship is well known through many realms, and
 god save you this day from shenship and shame.
 then sir tristram unarmed galleron, the which was a noble knight, and had
 done many deeds of arms, and he was a large knight of flesh and bone. and
 when he was unarmed he stood upon his feet, for he was bruised in the back
 with a spear; yet so as sir galleron might, he armed sir tristram. and
 then sir tristram mounted upon his own horse, and in his hand he gat sir
 galleron's spear; and therewithal sir palomides was ready. and so they
 came hurtling together, and either smote other in midst of their shields;
 and therewithal sir palomides' spear brake, and sir tristram smote down
 the horse; and sir palomides, as soon as he might, avoided his horse, and
 dressed his shield, and pulled out his sword. that saw sir tristram, and
 therewithal he alighted and tied his horse till a tree.
 chapter xiv. how sir tristram and sir palomides fought long together, and
 after accorded, and how sir tristram made him to be christened.
 and then they came together as two wild boars, lashing together, tracing
 and traversing as noble men that oft had been well proved in battle; but
 ever sir palomides dread the might of sir tristram, and therefore he
 suffered him to breathe him. thus they fought more than two hours, but
 often sir tristram smote such strokes at sir palomides that he made him to
 kneel; and sir palomides brake and cut away many pieces of sir tristram's
 shield; and then sir palomides wounded sir tristram, for he was a well
 fighting man. then sir tristram was wood wroth out of measure, and rushed
 upon sir palomides with such a might that sir palomides fell grovelling to
 the earth; and therewithal he leapt up lightly upon his feet, and then sir
 tristram wounded palomides sore through the shoulder. and ever sir
 tristram fought still in like hard, and sir palomides failed not, but gave
 him many sad strokes. and at the last sir tristram doubled his strokes,
 and by fortune sir tristram smote sir palomides sword out of his hand, and
 if sir palomides had stooped for his sword he had been slain.
 then palomides stood still and beheld his sword with a sorrowful heart.
 how now, said sir tristram unto palomides, now have i thee at advantage as
 thou haddest me this day; but it shall never be said in no court, nor
 among good knights, that sir tristram shall slay any knight that is
 weaponless; and therefore take thou thy sword, and let us make an end of
 this battle. as for to do this battle, said palomides, i dare right well
 end it, but i have no great lust to fight no more. and for this cause,
 said palomides: mine offence to you is not so great but that we may be
 friends. all that i have offended is and was for the love of la beale
 isoud. and as for her, i dare say she is peerless above all other ladies,
 and also i proffered her never no dishonour; and by her i have gotten the
 most part of my worship. and sithen i offended never as to her own person,
 and as for the offence that i have done, it was against your own person,
 and for that offence ye have given me this day many sad strokes, and some
 i have given you again; and now i dare say i felt never man of your might,
 nor so well breathed, but if it were sir launcelot du lake; wherefore i
 require you, my lord, forgive me all that i have offended unto you; and
 this same day have me to the next church, and first let me be clean
 confessed, and after see you now that i be truly baptised. and then will
 we all ride together unto the court of arthur, that we be there at the
 high feast. now take your horse, said sir tristram, and as ye say so it
 shall be, and all thine evil will god forgive it you, and i do. and here
 within this mile is the suffragan of carlisle that shall give you the
 sacrament of baptism.
 then they took their horses and sir galleron rode with them. and when they
 came to the suffragan sir tristram told him their desire. then the
 suffragan let fill a great vessel with water, and when he had hallowed it
 he then confessed clean sir palomides, and sir tristram and sir galleron
 were his godfathers. and then soon after they departed, riding toward
 camelot, where king arthur and queen guenever was, and for the most part
 all the knights of the round table. and so the king and all the court were
 glad that sir palomides was christened. and at the same feast in came
 galahad and sat in the siege perilous. and so therewithal departed and
 dissevered all the knights of the round table. and sir tristram returned
 again unto joyous gard, and sir palomides followed the questing beast.
here endeth the second book of sir tristram that was drawn out of
 french into english. but here is no rehersal of the third book. and here
 followeth the noble tale of the sangreal, that called is the holy vessel;
 and the signification of the blessed blood of our lord jesus christ,
 blessed mote it be, the which was brought into this land by joseph
 aramathie. therefore on all sinful souls blessed lord have thou mercy.

 chapter i. how at the vigil of the feast of pentecost entered into the
 hall before king arthur a damosel, and desired sir launcelot for to come
 and
 dub a knight, and how he went with her.
 at the vigil of pentecost, when all the fellowship of the round table were
 come unto camelot and there heard their service, and the tables were set
 ready to the meat, right so entered into the hall a full fair gentlewoman
 on horseback, that had ridden full fast, for her horse was all besweated.
 then she there alighted, and came before the king and saluted him; and he
 said: damosel, god thee bless. sir, said she, for god's sake say me where
 sir launcelot is. yonder ye may see him, said the king. then she went unto
 launcelot and said: sir launcelot, i salute you on king pelles' behalf,
 and i require you come on with me hereby into a forest. then sir launcelot
 asked her with whom she dwelled. i dwell, said she, with king pelles. what
 will ye with me? said launcelot. ye shall know, said she, when ye come
 thither. well, said he, i will gladly go with you. so sir launcelot bade
 his squire saddle his horse and bring his arms; and in all haste he did
 his commandment.
 then came the queen unto launcelot, and said: will ye leave us at this
 high feast? madam, said the gentlewoman, wit ye well he shall be with you
 to-morn by dinner time. if i wist, said the queen, that he should not be
 with us here to-morn he should not go with you by my good will. right so
 departed sir launcelot with the gentlewoman, and rode until that he came
 into a forest and into a great valley, where they saw an abbey of nuns;
 and there was a squire ready and opened the gates, and so they entered and
 descended off their horses; and there came a fair fellowship about sir
 launcelot, and welcomed him, and were passing glad of his coming. and then
 they led him unto the abbess's chamber and unarmed him; and right so he
 was ware upon a bed lying two of his cousins, sir bors and sir lionel, and
 then he waked them; and when they saw him they made great joy. sir, said
 sir bors unto sir launcelot, what adventure hath brought you hither, for
 we weened to-morn to have found you at camelot? as god me help, said sir
 launcelot, a gentlewoman brought me hither, but i know not the cause.
 in the meanwhile that they thus stood talking together, therein came
 twelve nuns that brought with them galahad, the which was passing fair and
 well made, that unnethe in the world men might not find his match: and all
 those ladies wept. sir, said they all, we bring you here this child the
 which we have nourished, and we pray you to make him a knight, for of a
 more worthier man's hand may he not receive the order of knighthood. sir
 launcelot beheld the young squire and saw him seemly and demure as a dove,
 with all manner of good features, that he weened of his age never to have
 seen so fair a man of form. then said sir launcelot: cometh this desire of
 himself? he and all they said yea. then shall he, said sir launcelot,
 receive the high order of knighthood as to-morn at the reverence of the
 high feast. that night sir launcelot had passing good cheer; and on the
 morn at the hour of prime, at galahad's desire, he made him knight and
 said: god make him a good man, for of beauty faileth you not as any that
 liveth.
 chapter ii. how the letters were found written in the siege perilous and
 of the marvellous adventure of the sword in a stone.
 now fair sir, said sir launcelot, will ye come with me unto the court of
 king arthur? nay, said he, i will not go with you as at this time. then he
 departed from them and took his two cousins with him, and so they came
 unto camelot by the hour of underne on whitsunday. by that time the king
 and the queen were gone to the minster to hear their service. then the
 king and the queen were passing glad of sir bors and sir lionel, and so
 was all the fellowship. so when the king and all the knights were come
 from service, the barons espied in the sieges of the round table all
 about, written with golden letters: here ought to sit he, and he ought to
 sit here. and thus they went so long till that they came to the siege
 perilous, where they found letters newly written of gold which said: four
 hundred winters and four and fifty accomplished after the passion of our
 lord jesu christ ought this siege to be fulfilled. then all they said:
 this is a marvellous thing and an adventurous. in the name of god, said
 sir launcelot; and then accompted the term of the writing from the birth
 of our lord unto that day. it seemeth me said sir launcelot, this siege
 ought to be fulfilled this same day, for this is the feast of pentecost
 after the four hundred and four and fifty year; and if it would please all
 parties, i would none of these letters were seen this day, till he be come
 that ought to enchieve this adventure. then made they to ordain a cloth of
 silk, for to cover these letters in the siege perilous.
 then the king bade haste unto dinner. sir, said sir kay the steward, if ye
 go now unto your meat ye shall break your old custom of your court, for ye
 have not used on this day to sit at your meat or that ye have seen some
 adventure. ye say sooth, said the king, but i had so great joy of sir
 launcelot and of his cousins, which be come to the court whole and sound,
 so that i bethought me not of mine old custom. so, as they stood speaking,
 in came a squire and said unto the king: sir, i bring unto you marvellous
 tidings. what be they? said the king. sir, there is here beneath at the
 river a great stone which i saw fleet above the water, and therein i saw
 sticking a sword. the king said: i will see that marvel. so all the
 knights went with him, and when they came to the river they found there a
 stone fleeting, as it were of red marble, and therein stuck a fair rich
 sword, and in the pommel thereof were precious stones wrought with subtle
 letters of gold. then the barons read the letters which said in this wise:
 never shall man take me hence, but only he by whose side i ought to hang,
 and he shall be the best knight of the world.
 when the king had seen the letters, he said unto sir launcelot: fair sir,
 this sword ought to be yours, for i am sure ye be the best knight of the
 world. then sir launcelot answered full soberly: certes, sir, it is not my
 sword; also, sir, wit ye well i have no hardiness to set my hand to it,
 for it longed not to hang by my side. also, who that assayeth to take the
 sword and faileth of it, he shall receive a wound by that sword that he
 shall not be whole long after. and i will that ye wit that this same day
 shall the adventures of the sangreal, that is called the holy vessel,
 begin
 chapter iii. how sir gawaine assayed to draw out the sword, and how an old
 man brought in galahad.
 now, fair nephew, said the king unto sir gawaine, assay ye, for my love.
 sir, he said, save your good grace i shall not do that. sir, said the
 king, assay to take the sword and at my commandment. sir, said gawaine,
 your commandment i will obey. and therewith he took up the sword by the
 handles, but he might not stir it. i thank you, said the king to sir
 gawaine. my lord sir gawaine, said sir launcelot, now wit ye well this
 sword shall touch you so sore that ye shall will ye had never set your
 hand thereto for the best castle of this realm. sir, he said, i might not
 withsay mine uncle's will and commandment. but when the king heard this he
 repented it much, and said unto sir percivale that he should assay, for
 his love. and he said: gladly, for to bear sir gawaine fellowship. and
 therewith he set his hand on the sword and drew it strongly, but he might
 not move it. then were there none () that durst be so hardy to set their
 hands thereto. now may ye go to your dinner, said sir kay unto the king,
 for a marvellous adventure have ye seen. so the king and all went unto the
 court, and every knight knew his own place, and set him therein, and young
 men that were knights served them.
 so when they were served, and all sieges fulfilled save only the siege
 perilous, anon there befell a marvellous adventure, that all the doors and
 windows of the palace shut by themself. not for then the hall was not
 greatly darked; and therewith they were all abashed both one and other.
 then king arthur spake first and said: by god, fair fellows and lords, we
 have seen this day marvels, but or night i suppose we shall see greater
 marvels.
 in the meanwhile came in a good old man, and an ancient, clothed all in
 white, and there was no knight knew from whence he came. and with him he
 brought a young knight, both on foot, in red arms, without sword or
 shield, save a scabbard hanging by his side. and these words he said:
 peace be with you, fair lords. then the old man said unto arthur: sir, i
 bring here a young knight, the which is of king's lineage, and of the
 kindred of joseph of aramathie, whereby the marvels of this court, and of
 strange realms, shall be fully accomplished.
  omitted by caxton, supplied from w. de worde.
 chapter iv. how the old man brought galahad to the siege perilous and set
 him therein, and how all the knights marvelled.
 the king was right glad of his words, and said unto the good man: sir, ye
 be right welcome, and the young knight with you. then the old man made the
 young man to unarm him, and he was in a coat of red sendal, and bare a
 mantle upon his shoulder that was furred with ermine, and put that upon
 him. and the old knight said unto the young knight: sir, follow me. and
 anon he led him unto the siege perilous, where beside sat sir launcelot;
 and the good man lift up the cloth, and found there letters that said
 thus: this is the siege of galahad, the haut prince. sir, said the old
 knight, wit ye well that place is yours. and then he set him down surely
 in that siege. and then he said to the old man: sir, ye may now go your
 way, for well have ye done that ye were commanded to do; and recommend me
 unto my grandsire, king pelles, and unto my lord petchere, and say them on
 my behalf, i shall come and see them as soon as ever i may. so the good
 man departed; and there met him twenty noble squires, and so took their
 horses and went their way.
 then all the knights of the table round marvelled greatly of sir galahad,
 that he durst sit there in that siege perilous, and was so tender of age;
 and wist not from whence he came but all only by god; and said: this is he
 by whom the sangreal shall be enchieved, for there sat never none but he,
 but he were mischieved. then sir launcelot beheld his son and had great
 joy of him. then bors told his fellows: upon pain of my life this young
 knight shall come unto great worship. this noise was great in all the
 court, so that it came to the queen. then she had marvel what knight it
 might be that durst adventure him to sit in the siege perilous. many said
 unto the queen he resembled much unto sir launcelot. i may well suppose,
 said the queen, that sir launcelot begat him on king pelles' daughter, by
 the which he was made to lie by, by enchantment, and his name is galahad.
 i would fain see him, said the queen, for he must needs be a noble man,
 for so is his father that him begat, i report me unto all the table round.
 so when the meat was done that the king and all were risen, the king yede
 unto the siege perilous and lift up the cloth, and found there the name of
 galahad; and then he shewed it unto sir gawaine, and said: fair nephew,
 now have we among us sir galahad, the good knight that shall worship us
 all; and upon pain of my life he shall enchieve the sangreal, right as sir
 launcelot had done us to understand. then came king arthur unto galahad
 and said: sir, ye be welcome, for ye shall move many good knights to the
 quest of the sangreal, and ye shall enchieve that never knights might
 bring to an end. then the king took him by the hand, and went down from
 the palace to shew galahad the adventures of the stone.
 chapter v. how king arthur shewed the stone hoving on the water to
 galahad, and how he drew out the sword.
 the queen heard thereof, and came after with many ladies, and shewed them
 the stone where it hoved on the water. sir, said the king unto sir
 galahad, here is a great marvel as ever i saw, and right good knights have
 assayed and failed. sir, said galahad, that is no marvel, for this
 adventure is not theirs but mine; and for the surety of this sword i
 brought none with me, for here by my side hangeth the scabbard. and anon
 he laid his hand on the sword, and lightly drew it out of the stone, and
 put it in the sheath, and said unto the king: now it goeth better than it
 did aforehand. sir, said the king, a shield god shall send you. now have i
 that sword that sometime was the good knight's, balin le savage, and he
 was a passing good man of his hands; and with this sword he slew his
 brother balan, and that was great pity, for he was a good knight, and
 either slew other through a dolorous stroke that balin gave unto my
 grandfather king pelles, the which is not yet whole, nor not shall be till
 i heal him.
 therewith the king and all espied where came riding down the river a lady
 on a white palfrey toward them. then she saluted the king and the queen,
 and asked if that sir launcelot was there. and then he answered himself: i
 am here, fair lady. then she said all with weeping: how your great doing
 is changed sith this day in the morn. damosel, why say you so? said
 launcelot. i say you sooth, said the damosel, for ye were this day the
 best knight of the world, but who should say so now, he should be a liar,
 for there is now one better than ye, and well it is proved by the
 adventures of the sword whereto ye durst not set to your hand; and that is
 the change and leaving of your name. wherefore i make unto you a
 remembrance, that ye shall not ween from henceforth that ye be the best
 knight of the world. as touching unto that, said launcelot, i know well i
 was never the best. yes, said the damosel, that were ye, and are yet, of
 any sinful man of the world. and, sir king, nacien, the hermit, sendeth
 thee word, that thee shall befall the greatest worship that ever befell
 king in britain; and i say you wherefore, for this day the sangreal
 appeared in thy house and fed thee and all thy fellowship of the round
 table. so she departed and went that same way that she came.
 chapter vi. how king arthur had all the knights together for to joust in
 the meadow beside camelot or they departed.
 now, said the king, i am sure at this quest of the sangreal shall all ye
 of the table round depart, and never shall i see you again whole together;
 therefore i will see you all whole together in the meadow of camelot to
 joust and to tourney, that after your death men may speak of it that such
 good knights were wholly together such a day. as unto that counsel and at
 the king's request they accorded all, and took on their harness that
 longed unto jousting. but all this moving of the king was for this intent,
 for to see galahad proved; for the king deemed he should not lightly come
 again unto the court after his departing. so were they assembled in the
 meadow, both more and less. then sir galahad, by the prayer of the king
 and the queen, did upon him a noble jesseraunce, and also he did on his
 helm, but shield would he take none for no prayer of the king. and then
 sir gawaine and other knights prayed him to take a spear. right so he did;
 and the queen was in a tower with all her ladies, for to behold that
 tournament. then sir galahad dressed him in midst of the meadow, and began
 to break spears marvellously, that all men had wonder of him; for he there
 surmounted all other knights, for within a while he had defouled many good
 knights of the table round save twain, that was sir launcelot and sir
 percivale.
 chapter vii. how the queen desired to see galahad; and how after, all the
 knights were replenished with the holy sangreal, and how they avowed the
 enquest of the same.
 then the king, at the queen's request, made him to alight and to unlace
 his helm, that the queen might see him in the visage. when she beheld him
 she said: soothly i dare well say that sir launcelot begat him, for never
 two men resembled more in likeness, therefore it nis no marvel though he
 be of great prowess. so a lady that stood by the queen said: madam, for
 god's sake ought he of right to be so good a knight? yea, forsooth, said
 the queen, for he is of all parties come of the best knights of the world
 and of the highest lineage; for sir launcelot is come but of the eighth
 degree from our lord jesu christ, and sir galahad is of the ninth degree
 from our lord jesu christ, therefore i dare say they be the greatest
 gentlemen of the world.
 and then the king and all estates went home unto camelot, and so went to
 evensong to the great minster, and so after upon that to supper, and every
 knight sat in his own place as they were toforehand. then anon they heard
 cracking and crying of thunder, that them thought the place should all
 to-drive. in the midst of this blast entered a sunbeam more clearer by
 seven times than ever they saw day, and all they were alighted of the
 grace of the holy ghost. then began every knight to behold other, and
 either saw other, by their seeming, fairer than ever they saw afore. not
 for then there was no knight might speak one word a great while, and so
 they looked every man on other as they had been dumb. then there entered
 into the hall the holy grail covered with white samite, but there was none
 might see it, nor who bare it. and there was all the hall fulfilled with
 good odours, and every knight had such meats and drinks as he best loved
 in this world. and when the holy grail had been borne through the hall,
 then the holy vessel departed suddenly, that they wist not where it
 became: then had they all breath to speak. and then the king yielded
 thankings to god, of his good grace that he had sent them. certes, said
 the king, we ought to thank our lord jesu greatly for that he hath shewed
 us this day, at the reverence of this high feast of pentecost.
 now, said sir gawaine, we have been served this day of what meats and
 drinks we thought on; but one thing beguiled us, we might not see the holy
 grail, it was so preciously covered. wherefore i will make here avow, that
 to-morn, without longer abiding, i shall labour in the quest of the
 sangreal, that i shall hold me out a twelvemonth and a day, or more if
 need be, and never shall i return again unto the court till i have seen it
 more openly than it hath been seen here; and if i may not speed i shall
 return again as he that may not be against the will of our lord jesu
 christ.
 when they of the table round heard sir gawaine say so, they arose up the
 most part and made such avows as sir gawaine had made. anon as king arthur
 heard this he was greatly displeased, for he wist well they might not
 again-say their avows. alas, said king arthur unto sir gawaine, ye have
 nigh slain me with the avow and promise that ye have made; for through you
 ye have bereft me the fairest fellowship and the truest of knighthood that
 ever were seen together in any realm of the world; for when they depart
 from hence i am sure they all shall never meet more in this world, for
 they shall die many in the quest. and so it forthinketh me a little, for i
 have loved them as well as my life, wherefore it shall grieve me right
 sore, the departition of this fellowship: for i have had an old custom to
 have them in my fellowship.
 chapter viii. how great sorrow was made of the king and the queen and
 ladies for the departing of the knights, and how they departed.
 and therewith the tears fell in his eyes. and then he said: gawaine,
 gawaine, ye have set me in great sorrow, for i have great doubt that my
 true fellowship shall never meet here more again. ah, said sir launcelot,
 comfort yourself; for it shall be unto us a great honour and much more
 than if we died in any other places, for of death we be siker. ah,
 launcelot, said the king, the great love that i have had unto you all the
 days of my life maketh me to say such doleful words; for never christian
 king had never so many worthy men at his table as i have had this day at
 the round table, and that is my great sorrow.
 when the queen, ladies, and gentlewomen, wist these tidings, they had such
 sorrow and heaviness that there might no tongue tell it, for those knights
 had held them in honour and chierté. but among all other queen guenever
 made great sorrow. i marvel, said she, my lord would suffer them to depart
 from him. thus was all the court troubled for the love of the departition
 of those knights. and many of those ladies that loved knights would have
 gone with their lovers; and so had they done, had not an old knight come
 among them in religious clothing; and then he spake all on high and said:
 fair lords, which have sworn in the quest of the sangreal, thus sendeth
 you nacien, the hermit, word, that none in this quest lead lady nor
 gentlewoman with him, for it is not to do in so high a service as they
 labour in; for i warn you plain, he that is not clean of his sins he shall
 not see the mysteries of our lord jesu christ. and for this cause they
 left these ladies and gentlewomen.
 after this the queen came unto galahad and asked him of whence he was, and
 of what country. he told her of whence he was. and son unto launcelot, she
 said he was. as to that, he said neither yea nor nay. so god me help, said
 the queen, of your father ye need not to shame you, for he is the
 goodliest knight, and of the best men of the world come, and of the
 strain, of all parties, of kings. wherefore ye ought of right to be, of
 your deeds, a passing good man; and certainly, she said, ye resemble him
 much. then sir galahad was a little ashamed and said: madam, sith ye know
 in certain, wherefore do ye ask it me? for he that is my father shall be
 known openly and all betimes. and then they went to rest them. and in the
 honour of the highness of galahad he was led into king arthur's chamber,
 and there rested in his own bed.
 and as soon as it was day the king arose, for he had no rest of all that
 night for sorrow. then he went unto gawaine and to sir launcelot that were
 arisen for to hear mass. and then the king again said: ah gawaine,
 gawaine, ye have betrayed me; for never shall my court be amended by you,
 but ye will never be sorry for me as i am for you. and therewith the tears
 began to run down by his visage. and therewith the king said: ah, knight
 sir launcelot, i require thee thou counsel me, for i would that this quest
 were undone, an it might be sir, said sir launcelot, ye saw yesterday so
 many worthy knights that then were sworn that they may not leave it in no
 manner of wise. that wot i well, said the king, but it shall so heavy me
 at their departing that i wot well there shall no manner of joy remedy me.
 and then the king and the queen went unto the minster. so anon launcelot
 and gawaine commanded their men to bring their arms. and when they all
 were armed save their shields and their helms, then they came to their
 fellowship, which were all ready in the same wise, for to go to the
 minster to hear their service.
 then after the service was done the king would wit how many had undertaken
 the quest of the holy grail; and to accompt them he prayed them all. then
 found they by the tale an hundred and fifty, and all were knights of the
 round table. and then they put on their helms and departed, and
 recommended them all wholly unto the queen; and there was weeping and
 great sorrow. then the queen departed into her chamber and held her, so
 that no man should perceive her great sorrows. when sir launcelot missed
 the queen he went till her chamber, and when she saw him she cried aloud:
 o launcelot, launcelot, ye have betrayed me and put me to the death, for
 to leave thus my lord. ah, madam, i pray you be not displeased, for i
 shall come again as soon as i may with my worship. alas, said she, that
 ever i saw you; but he that suffered upon the cross for all mankind, he be
 unto you good conduct and safety, and all the whole fellowship.
 right so departed sir launcelot, and found his fellowship that abode his
 coming. and so they mounted upon their horses and rode through the streets
 of camelot; and there was weeping of rich and poor, and the king turned
 away and might not speak for weeping. so within a while they came to a
 city, and a castle that hight vagon. there they entered into the castle,
 and the lord of that castle was an old man that hight vagon, and he was a
 good man of his living, and set open the gates, and made them all the
 cheer that he might. and so on the morn they were all accorded that they
 should depart everych from other; and on the morn they departed with
 weeping cheer, and every knight took the way that him liked best.
 chapter ix. how galahad gat him a shield, and how they sped that presumed
 to take down the said shield.
 now rideth sir galahad yet without shield, and so he rode four days
 without any adventure. and at the fourth day after evensong he came to a
 white abbey, and there he was received with great reverence, and led unto
 a chamber, and there was he unarmed; and then was he ware of two
 ()knights of the table round, one was sir bagdemagus, and ()that other
 was sir uwaine. and when they saw him they went unto galahad and made of
 him great solace, and so they went unto supper. sirs, said sir galahad,
 what adventure brought you hither? sir, said they, it is told us that
 within this place is a shield that no man may bear about his neck but he
 be mischieved outher dead within three days, or maimed for ever. ah sir,
 said king bagdemagus, i shall it bear to-morrow for to assay this
 adventure. in the name of god, said sir galahad. sir, said bagdemagus, an
 i may not enchieve the adventure of this shield ye shall take it upon you,
 for i am sure ye shall not fail. sir, said galahad, i right well agree me
 thereto, for i have no shield. so on the morn they arose and heard mass.
 then bagdemagus asked where the adventurous shield was. anon a monk led
 him behind an altar where the shield hung as white as any snow, but in the
 midst was a red cross. sir, said the monk, this shield ought not to be
 hanged about no knight's neck but he be the worthiest knight of the world;
  omitted by caxton, supplied from w. de worde.
 therefore i counsel you knights to be well advised. well, said bagdemagus,
 i wot well that i am not the best knight of the world, but yet i shall
 assay to bear it, and so bare it out of the minster. and then he said unto
 galahad: an it please you abide here still, till ye wit how that i speed.
 i shall abide you, said galahad. then king bagdemagus took with him a good
 squire, to bring tidings unto sir galahad how he sped.
 then when they had ridden a two mile and came to a fair valley afore an
 hermitage, then they saw a knight come from that part in white armour,
 horse and all; and he came as fast as his horse might run, and his spear
 in his rest, and bagdemagus dressed his spear against him and brake it
 upon the white knight. but the other struck him so hard that he brast the
 mails, and sheef him through the right shoulder, for the shield covered
 him not as at that time; and so he bare him from his horse. and therewith
 he alighted and took the white shield from him, saying: knight, thou hast
 done thyself great folly, for this shield ought not to be borne but by him
 that shall have no peer that liveth. and then he came to bagdemagus'
 squire and said: bear this shield unto the good knight sir galahad, that
 thou left in the abbey, and greet him well by me. sir, said the squire,
 what is your name? take thou no heed of my name, said the knight, for it
 is not for thee to know nor for none earthly man. now, fair sir, said the
 squire, at the reverence of jesu christ, tell me for what cause this
 shield may not be borne but if the bearer thereof be mischieved. now sith
 thou hast conjured me so, said the knight, this shield behoveth unto no
 man but unto galahad. and the squire went unto bagdemagus and asked
 whether he were sore wounded or not. yea forsooth, said he, i shall escape
 hard from the death. then he fetched his horse, and brought him with great
 pain unto an abbey. then was he taken down softly and unarmed, and laid in
 a bed, and there was looked to his wounds. and as the book telleth, he lay
 there long, and escaped hard with the life.
 chapter x. how galahad departed with the shield, and how king evelake had
 received the shield of joseph of aramathie.
 sir galahad, said the squire, that knight that wounded bagdemagus sendeth
 you greeting, and bade that ye should bear this shield, wherethrough great
 adventures should befall. now blessed be god and fortune, said galahad.
 and then he asked his arms, and mounted upon his horse, and hung the white
 shield about his neck, and commended them unto god. and sir uwaine said he
 would bear him fellowship if it pleased him. sir, said galahad, that may
 ye not, for i must go alone, save this squire shall bear me fellowship:
 and so departed uwaine.
 then within a while came galahad thereas the white knight abode him by the
 hermitage, and everych saluted other courteously. sir, said galahad, by
 this shield be many marvels fallen. sir, said the knight, it befell after
 the passion of our lord jesu christ thirty-two year, that joseph of
 aramathie, the gentle knight, the which took down our lord off the holy
 cross, at that time he departed from jerusalem with a great party of his
 kindred with him. and so he laboured till that they came to a city that
 hight sarras. and at that same hour that joseph came to sarras there was a
 king that hight evelake, that had great war against the saracens, and in
 especial against one saracen, the which was king evelake's cousin, a rich
 king and a mighty, which marched nigh this land, and his name was called
 tolleme la feintes. so on a day these two met to do battle. then joseph,
 the son of joseph of aramathie, went to king evelake and told him he
 should be discomfit and slain, but if he left his belief of the old law
 and believed upon the new law. and then there he shewed him the right
 belief of the holy trinity, to the which he agreed unto with all his
 heart; and there this shield was made for king evelake, in the name of him
 that died upon the cross. and then through his good belief he had the
 better of king tolleme. for when evelake was in the battle there was a
 cloth set afore the shield, and when he was in the greatest peril he let
 put away the cloth, and then his enemies saw a figure of a man on the
 cross, wherethrough they all were discomfit. and so it befell that a man
 of king evelake's was smitten his hand off, and bare that hand in his
 other hand; and joseph called that man unto him and bade him go with good
 devotion touch the cross. and as soon as that man had touched the cross
 with his hand it was as whole as ever it was to-fore. then soon after
 there fell a great marvel, that the cross of the shield at one time
 vanished away that no man wist where it became. and then king evelake was
 baptised, and for the most part all the people of that city. so, soon
 after joseph would depart, and king evelake would go with him, whether he
 wold or nold. and so by fortune they came into this land, that at that
 time was called great britain; and there they found a great felon paynim,
 that put joseph into prison. and so by fortune tidings came unto a worthy
 man that hight mondrames, and he assembled all his people for the great
 renown he had heard of joseph; and so he came into the land of great
 britain and disherited this felon paynim and consumed him, and therewith
 delivered joseph out of prison. and after that all the people were turned
 to the christian faith.
 chapter xi. how joseph made a cross on the white shield with his blood,
 and how galahad was by a monk brought to a tomb.
 not long after that joseph was laid in his deadly bed. and when king
 evelake saw that he made much sorrow, and said: for thy love i have left
 my country, and sith ye shall depart out of this world, leave me some
 token of yours that i may think on you. joseph said: that will i do full
 gladly; now bring me your shield that i took you when ye went into battle
 against king tolleme. then joseph bled sore at the nose, so that he might
 not by no mean be staunched. and there upon that shield he made a cross of
 his own blood. now may ye see a remembrance that i love you, for ye shall
 never see this shield but ye shall think on me, and it shall be always as
 fresh as it is now. and never shall man bear this shield about his neck
 but he shall repent it, unto the time that galahad, the good knight, bear
 it; and the last of my lineage shall have it about his neck, that shall do
 many marvellous deeds. now, said king evelake, where shall i put this
 shield, that this worthy knight may have it? ye shall leave it thereas
 nacien, the hermit, shall be put after his death; for thither shall that
 good knight come the fifteenth day after that he shall receive the order
 of knighthood: and so that day that they set is this time that he have his
 shield, and in the same abbey lieth nacien, the hermit. and then the white
 knight vanished away.
 anon as the squire had heard these words, he alighted off his hackney and
 kneeled down at galahad's feet, and prayed him that he might go with him
 till he had made him knight. yea, () i would not refuse you. then will ye
 make me a knight? said the squire, and that order, by the grace of god,
 shall be well set in me. so sir galahad granted him, and turned again unto
 the abbey where they came from; and there men made great joy of sir
 galahad. and anon as he was alighted there was a monk brought him unto a
 tomb in a churchyard, where there was such a noise that who that heard it
 should verily nigh be mad or lose his strength: and sir, they said, we
 deem it is a fiend.
  caxton "yf," for which "ye" seems the easiest emendation that will save the sense.
 chapter xii. of the marvel that sir galahad saw and heard in the tomb, and
 how he made melias knight.
 now lead me thither, said galahad. and so they did, all armed save his
 helm. now, said the good man, go to the tomb and lift it up. so he did,
 and heard a great noise; and piteously he said, that all men might hear
 it: sir galahad, the servant of jesu christ, come thou not nigh me, for
 thou shalt make me go again there where i have been so long. but galahad
 was nothing afraid, but lifted up the stone; and there came out so foul a
 smoke, and after he saw the foulest figure leap thereout that ever he saw
 in the likeness of a man; and then he blessed him and wist well it was a
 fiend. then heard he a voice say galahad, i see there environ about thee
 so many angels that my power may not dere thee{sic} right so sir galahad
 saw a body all armed lie in that tomb, and beside him a sword. now, fair
 brother, said galahad, let us remove this body, for it is not worthy to
 lie in this churchyard, for he was a false christian man. and therewith
 they all departed and went to the abbey. and anon as he was unarmed a good
 man came and set him down by him and said: sir, i shall tell you what
 betokeneth all that ye saw in the tomb; for that covered body betokeneth
 the duresse of the world, and the great sin that our lord found in the
 world. for there was such wretchedness that the father loved not the son,
 nor the son loved not the father; and that was one of the causes that our
 lord took flesh and blood of a clean maiden, for our sins were so great at
 that time that well-nigh all was wickedness. truly, said galahad, i
 believe you right well.
 so sir galahad rested him there that night; and upon the morn he made the
 squire knight, and asked him his name, and of what kindred he was come.
 sir, said he, men calleth me melias de lile, and i am the son of the king
 of denmark. now, fair sir, said galahad, sith that ye be come of kings and
 queens, now look that knighthood be well set in you, for ye ought to be a
 mirror unto all chivalry. sir, said sir melias, ye say sooth. but, sir,
 sithen ye have made me a knight ye must of right grant me my first desire
 that is reasonable. ye say sooth, said galahad. melias said: then that ye
 will suffer me to ride with you in this quest of the sangreal, till that
 some adventure depart us. i grant you, sir.
 then men brought sir melias his armour and his spear and his horse, and so
 sir galahad and he rode forth all that week or they found any adventure.
 and then upon a monday in the morning, as they were departed from an
 abbey, they came to a cross which departed two ways, and in that cross
 were letters written that said thus: now, ye knights errant, the which
 goeth to seek knights adventurous, see here two ways; that one way
 defendeth thee that thou ne go that way, for he shall not go out of the
 way again but if he be a good man and a worthy knight; and if thou go on
 the left hand, thou shalt not lightly there win prowess, for thou shalt in
 this way be soon assayed. sir, said melias to galahad, if it like you to
 suffer me to take the way on the left hand, tell me, for there i shall
 well prove my strength. it were better, said galahad, ye rode not that
 way, for i deem i should better escape in that way than ye. nay, my lord,
 i pray you let me have that adventure. take it in god's name, said
 galahad.
 chapter xiii. of the adventure that melias had, and how galahad revenged
 him, and how melias was carried into an abbey.
 and then rode melias into an old forest, and therein he rode two days and
 more. and then he came into a fair meadow, and there was a fair lodge of
 boughs. and then he espied in that lodge a chair, wherein was a crown of
 gold, subtly wrought. also there were cloths covered upon the earth, and
 many delicious meats set thereon. sir melias beheld this adventure, and
 thought it marvellous, but he had no hunger, but of the crown of gold he
 took much keep; and therewith he stooped down and took it up, and rode his
 way with it. and anon he saw a knight came riding after him that said:
 knight, set down that crown which is not yours, and therefore defend you.
 then sir melias blessed him and said: fair lord of heaven, help and save
 thy new-made knight. and then they let their horses run as fast as they
 might, so that the other knight smote sir melias through hauberk and
 through the left side, that he fell to the earth nigh dead. and then he
 took the crown and went his way; and sir melias lay still and had no power
 to stir.
 in the meanwhile by fortune there came sir galahad and found him there in
 peril of death. and then he said: ah melias, who hath wounded you?
 therefore it had been better to have ridden the other way. and when sir
 melias heard him speak: sir, he said, for god's love let me not die in
 this forest, but bear me unto the abbey here beside, that i may be
 confessed and have my rights. it shall be done, said galahad, but where is
 he that hath wounded you? with that sir galahad heard in the leaves cry on
 high: knight, keep thee from me. ah sir, said melias, beware, for that is
 he that hath slain me. sir galahad answered: sir knight, come on your
 peril. then either dressed to other, and came together as fast as their
 horses might run, and galahad smote him so that his spear went through his
 shoulder, and smote him down off his horse, and in the falling galahad's
 spear brake.
 with that came out another knight out of the leaves, and brake a spear
 upon galahad or ever he might turn him. then galahad drew out his sword
 and smote off the left arm of him, so that it fell to the earth. and then
 he fled, and sir galahad pursued fast after him. and then he turned again
 unto sir melias, and there he alighted and dressed him softly on his horse
 to-fore him, for the truncheon of his spear was in his body; and sir
 galahad stert up behind him, and held him in his arms, and so brought him
 to the abbey, and there unarmed him and brought him to his chamber. and
 then he asked his saviour. and when he had received him he said unto sir
 galahad: sir, let death come when it pleaseth him. and therewith he drew
 out the truncheon of the spear out of his body: and then he swooned.
 then came there an old monk which sometime had been a knight, and beheld
 sir melias. and anon he ransacked him; and then he said unto sir galahad:
 i shall heal him of his wound, by the grace of god, within the term of
 seven weeks. then was sir galahad glad, and unarmed him, and said he would
 abide there three days. and then he asked sir melias how it stood with
 him. then he said he was turned unto helping, god be thanked.
 chapter xiv. how sir galahad departed, and how he was commanded to go to
 the castle of maidens to destroy the wicked custom.
 now will i depart, said galahad, for i have much on hand, for many good
 knights be full busy about it, and this knight and i were in the same
 quest of the sangreal. sir, said a good man, for his sin he was thus
 wounded; and i marvel, said the good man, how ye durst take upon you so
 rich a thing as the high order of knighthood without clean confession, and
 that was the cause ye were bitterly wounded. for the way on the right hand
 betokeneth the highway of our lord jesu christ, and the way of a good true
 good liver. and the other way betokeneth the way of sinners and of
 misbelievers. and when the devil saw your pride and presumption, for to
 take you in the quest of the sangreal, that made you to be overthrown, for
 it may not be enchieved but by virtuous living. also, the writing on the
 cross was a signification of heavenly deeds, and of knightly deeds in
 god's works, and no knightly deeds in worldly works. and pride is head of
 all deadly sins, that caused this knight to depart from galahad. and where
 thou tookest the crown of gold thou sinnest in covetise and in theft: all
 this were no knightly deeds. and this galahad, the holy knight, the which
 fought with the two knights, the two knights signify the two deadly sins
 which were wholly in this knight melias; and they might not withstand you,
 for ye are without deadly sin.
 now departed galahad from thence, and betaught them all unto god. sir
 melias said: my lord galahad, as soon as i may ride i shall seek you. god
 send you health, said galahad, and so took his horse and departed, and
 rode many journeys forward and backward, as adventure would lead him. and
 at the last it happened him to depart from a place or a castle the which
 was named abblasoure; and he had heard no mass, the which he was wont ever
 to hear or ever he departed out of any castle or place, and kept that for
 a custom. then sir galahad came unto a mountain where he found an old
 chapel, and found there nobody, for all, all was desolate; and there he
 kneeled to-fore the altar, and besought god of wholesome counsel. so as he
 prayed he heard a voice that said: go thou now, thou adventurous knight,
 to the castle of maidens, and there do thou away the wicked customs.
 chapter xv. how sir galahad fought with the knights of the castle, and
 destroyed the wicked custom.
 when sir galahad heard this he thanked god, and took his horse; and he had
 not ridden but half a mile, he saw in the valley afore him a strong castle
 with deep ditches, and there ran beside it a fair river that hight severn;
 and there he met with a man of great age, and either saluted other, and
 galahad asked him the castle's name. fair sir, said he, it is the castle
 of maidens. that is a cursed castle, said galahad, and all they that be
 conversant therein, for all pity is out thereof, and all hardiness and
 mischief is therein. therefore, i counsel you, sir knight, to turn again.
 sir, said galahad, wit you well i shall not turn again. then looked sir
 galahad on his arms that nothing failed him, and then he put his shield
 afore him; and anon there met him seven fair maidens, the which said unto
 him: sir knight, ye ride here in a great folly, for ye have the water to
 pass over. why should i not pass the water? said galahad. so rode he away
 from them and met with a squire that said: knight, those knights in the
 castle defy you, and defenden you ye go no further till that they wit what
 ye would. fair sir, said galahad, i come for to destroy the wicked custom
 of this castle. sir, an ye will abide by that ye shall have enough to do.
 go you now, said galahad, and haste my needs.
 then the squire entered into the castle. and anon after there came out of
 the castle seven knights, and all were brethren. and when they saw galahad
 they cried: knight, keep thee, for we assure thee nothing but death. why,
 said galahad, will ye all have ado with me at once? yea, said they,
 thereto mayst thou trust. then galahad put forth his spear and smote the
 foremost to the earth, that near he brake his neck. and therewithal the
 other smote him on his shield great strokes, so that their spears brake.
 then sir galahad drew out his sword, and set upon them so hard that it was
 marvel to see it, and so through great force he made them to forsake the
 field; and galahad chased them till they entered into the castle, and so
 passed through the castle at another gate.
 and there met sir galahad an old man clothed in religious clothing, and
 said: sir, have here the keys of this castle. then sir galahad opened the
 gates, and saw so much people in the streets that he might not number
 them, and all said: sir, ye be welcome, for long have we abiden here our
 deliverance. then came to him a gentlewoman and said: these knights be
 fled, but they will come again this night, and here to begin again their
 evil custom. what will ye that i shall do? said galahad. sir, said the
 gentlewoman, that ye send after all the knights hither that hold their
 lands of this castle, and make them to swear for to use the customs that
 were used heretofore of old time. i will well, said galahad. and there she
 brought him an horn of ivory, bounden with gold richly, and said: sir,
 blow this horn which will be heard two mile about this castle. when sir
 galahad had blown the horn he set him down upon a bed.
 then came a priest to galahad, and said: sir, it is past a seven year
 agone that these seven brethren came into this castle, and harboured with
 the lord of this castle that hight the duke lianour, and he was lord of
 all this country. and when they espied the duke's daughter, that was a
 full fair woman, then by their false covin they made debate betwixt
 themself, and the duke of his goodness would have departed them, and there
 they slew him and his eldest son. and then they took the maiden and the
 treasure of the castle. and then by great force they held all the knights
 of this castle against their will under their obeissance, and in great
 service and truage, robbing and pilling the poor common people of all that
 they had. so it happened on a day the duke's daughter said: ye have done
 unto me great wrong to slay mine own father, and my brother, and thus to
 hold our lands: not for then, she said, ye shall not hold this castle for
 many years, for by one knight ye shall be overcome. thus she prophesied
 seven years agone. well, said the seven knights, sithen ye say so, there
 shall never lady nor knight pass this castle but they shall abide maugre
 their heads, or die therefore, till that knight be come by whom we shall
 lose this castle. and therefore is it called the maidens' castle, for they
 have devoured many maidens. now, said galahad, is she here for whom this
 castle was lost? nay sir, said the priest, she was dead within these three
 nights after that she was thus enforced; and sithen have they kept her
 younger sister, which endureth great pains with mo other ladies.
 by this were the knights of the country come, and then he made them do
 homage and fealty to the king's daughter, and set them in great ease of
 heart. and in the morn there came one to galahad and told him how that
 gawaine, gareth, and uwaine, had slain the seven brethren. i suppose well,
 said sir galahad, and took his armour and his horse, and commended them
 unto god.
 chapter xvi. how sir gawaine came to the abbey for to follow galahad, and
 how he was shriven to a hermit.
 now, saith the tale, after sir gawaine departed, he rode many journeys,
 both toward and froward. and at the last he came to the abbey where sir
 galahad had the white shield, and there sir gawaine learned the way to
 sewe after sir galahad; and so he rode to the abbey where melias lay sick,
 and there sir melias told sir gawaine of the marvellous adventures that
 sir galahad did. certes, said sir gawaine, i am not happy that i took not
 the way that he went, for an i may meet with him i will not depart from
 him lightly, for all marvellous adventures sir galahad enchieveth. sir,
 said one of the monks, he will not of your fellowship. why? said sir
 gawaine. sir, said he, for ye be wicked and sinful, and he is full
 blessed. right as they thus stood talking there came in riding sir gareth.
 and then they made joy either of other. and on the morn they heard mass,
 and so departed. and by the way they met with sir uwaine les avoutres, and
 there sir uwaine told sir gawaine how he had met with none adventure sith
 he departed from the court. nor we, said sir gawaine. and either promised
 other of the three knights not to depart while they were in that quest,
 but if fortune caused it.
 so they departed and rode by fortune till that they came by the castle of
 maidens; and there the seven brethren espied the three knights, and said:
 sithen, we be flemed by one knight from this castle, we shall destroy all
 the knights of king arthur's that we may overcome, for the love of sir
 galahad. and therewith the seven knights set upon the three knights, and
 by fortune sir gawaine slew one ot the brethren, and each one of his
 fellows slew another, and so slew the remnant. and then they took the way
 under the castle, and there they lost the way that sir galahad rode, and
 there everych of them departed from other; and sir gawaine rode till he
 came to an hermitage, and there he found the good man saying his evensong
 of our lady; and there sir gawaine asked harbour for charity, and the good
 man granted it him gladly.
 then the good man asked him what he was. sir, he said, i am a knight of
 king arthur's that am in the quest of the sangreal, and my name is sir
 gawaine. sir, said the good man, i would wit how it standeth betwixt god
 and you. sir, said sir gawaine, i will with a good will shew you my life
 if it please you; and there he told the hermit how a monk of an abbey
 called me wicked knight. he might well say it, said the hermit, for when
 ye were first made knight ye should have taken you to knightly deeds and
 virtuous living, and ye have done the contrary, for ye have lived
 mischievously many winters; and sir galahad is a maid and sinned never,
 and that is the cause he shall enchieve where he goeth that ye nor none
 such shall not attain, nor none in your fellowship, for ye have used the
 most untruest life that ever i heard knight live. for certes had ye not
 been so wicked as ye are, never had the seven brethren been slain by you
 and your two fellows. for sir galahad himself alone beat them all seven
 the day to-fore, but his living is such he shall slay no man lightly. also
 i may say you the castle of maidens betokeneth the good souls that were in
 prison afore the incarnation of jesu christ. and the seven knights betoken
 the seven deadly sins that reigned that time in the world; and i may liken
 the good galahad unto the son of the high father, that lighted within a
 maid, and bought all the souls out of thrall, so did sir galahad deliver
 all the maidens out of the woful castle.
 now, sir gawaine, said the good man, thou must do penance for thy sin.
 sir, what penance shall i do? such as i will give, said the good man. nay,
 said sir gawaine, i may do no penance; for we knights adventurous oft
 suffer great woe and pain. well, said the good man, and then he held his
 peace. and on the morn sir gawaine departed from the hermit, and betaught
 him unto god. and by adventure he met with sir aglovale and sir griflet,
 two knights of the table round. and they two rode four days without
 finding of any adventure, and at the fifth day they departed. and everych
 held as fell them by adventure. here leaveth the tale of sir gawaine and
 his fellows, and speak we of sir galahad.
 chapter xvii. how sir galahad met with sir launcelot and sir percivale,
 and smote them down, and departed from them.
 so when sir galahad was departed from the castle of maidens he rode till
 he came to a waste forest, and there he met with sir launcelot and sir
 percivale, but they knew him not, for he was new disguised. right so sir
 launcelot, his father, dressed his spear and brake it upon sir galahad,
 and galahad smote him so again that he smote down horse and man. and then
 he drew his sword, and dressed him unto sir percivale, and smote him so on
 the helm, that it rove to the coif of steel; and had not the sword swerved
 sir percivale had been slain, and with the stroke he fell out of his
 saddle. this jousts was done to-fore the hermitage where a recluse
 dwelled. and when she saw sir galahad ride, she said: god be with thee,
 best knight of the world. ah certes, said she, all aloud that launcelot
 and percivale might hear it: an yonder two knights had known thee as well
 as i do they would not have encountered with thee. then sir galahad heard
 her say so he was adread to be known: therewith he smote his horse with
 his spurs and rode a great pace froward them. then perceived they both
 that he was galahad; and up they gat on their horses, and rode fast after
 him, but in a while he was out of their sight. and then they turned again
 with heavy cheer. let us spere some tidings, said percivale, at yonder
 recluse. do as ye list, said sir launcelot.
 when sir percivale came to the recluse she knew him well enough, and sir
 launcelot both. but sir launcelot rode overthwart and endlong in a wild
 forest, and held no path but as wild adventure led him. and at the last he
 came to a stony cross which departed two ways in waste land; and by the
 cross was a stone that was of marble, but it was so dark that sir
 launcelot might not wit what it was. then sir launcelot looked by him, and
 saw an old chapel, and there he weened to have found people; and sir
 launcelot tied his horse till a tree, and there he did off his shield and
 hung it upon a tree, and then went to the chapel door, and found it waste
 and broken. and within he found a fair altar, full richly arrayed with
 cloth of clean silk, and there stood a fair clean candlestick, which bare
 six great candles, and the candlestick was of silver. and when sir
 launcelot saw this light he had great will for to enter into the chapel,
 but he could find no place where he might enter; then was he passing heavy
 and dismayed. then he returned and came to his horse and did off his
 saddle and bridle, and let him pasture, and unlaced his helm, and ungirt
 his sword, and laid him down to sleep upon his shield to-fore the cross.
 chapter xviii. how sir launcelot, half sleeping and half waking, saw a
 sick man borne in a litter, and how he was healed with the sangreal.
 and so he fell asleep; and half waking and sleeping he saw come by him two
 palfreys all fair and white, the which bare a litter, therein lying a sick
 knight. and when he was nigh the cross he there abode still. all this sir
 launcelot saw and beheld, for he slept not verily; and he heard him say: o
 sweet lord, when shall this sorrow leave me? and when shall the holy
 vessel come by me, wherethrough i shall be blessed? for i have endured
 thus long, for little trespass. a full great while complained the knight
 thus, and always sir launcelot heard it. with that sir launcelot saw the
 candlestick with the six tapers come before the cross, and he saw nobody
 that brought it. also there came a table of silver, and the holy vessel of
 the sangreal, which launcelot had seen aforetime in king pescheour's
 house. and therewith the sick knight set him up, and held up both his
 hands, and said: fair sweet lord, which is here within this holy vessel;
 take heed unto me that i may be whole of this malady. and therewith on his
 hands and on his knees he went so nigh that he touched the holy vessel and
 kissed it, and anon he was whole; and then he said: lord god, i thank
 thee, for i am healed of this sickness.
 so when the holy vessel had been there a great while it went unto the
 chapel with the chandelier and the light, so that launcelot wist not where
 it was become; for he was overtaken with sin that he had no power to rise
 again the holy vessel; wherefore after that many men said of him shame,
 but he took repentance after that. then the sick knight dressed him up and
 kissed the cross; anon his squire brought him his arms, and asked his lord
 how he did. certes, said he, i thank god right well, through the holy
 vessel i am healed. but i have marvel of this sleeping knight that had no
 power to awake when this holy vessel was brought hither. i dare right well
 say, said the squire, that he dwelleth in some deadly sin whereof he was
 never confessed. by my faith, said the knight, whatsomever he be he is
 unhappy, for as i deem he is of the fellowship of the round table, the
 which is entered into the quest of the sangreal. sir, said the squire,
 here i have brought you all your arms save your helm and your sword, and
 therefore by mine assent now may ye take this knight's helm and his sword:
 and so he did. and when he was clean armed he took sir launcelot's horse,
 for he was better than his; and so departed they from the cross.
 chapter xix. how a voice spake to sir launcelot, and how he found his
 horse and his helm borne away, and after went afoot.
 then anon sir launcelot waked, and set him up, and bethought him what he
 had seen there, and whether it were dreams or not. right so heard he a
 voice that said: sir launcelot, more harder than is the stone, and more
 bitter than is the wood, and more naked and barer than is the leaf of the
 fig tree; therefore go thou from hence, and withdraw thee from this holy
 place. and when sir launcelot heard this he was passing heavy and wist not
 what to do, and so departed sore weeping, and cursed the time that he was
 born. for then he deemed never to have had worship more. for those words
 went to his heart, till that he knew wherefore he was called so. then sir
 launcelot went to the cross and found his helm, his sword, and his horse
 taken away. and then he called himself a very wretch, and most unhappy of
 all knights; and there he said: my sin and my wickedness have brought me
 unto great dishonour. for when i sought worldly adventures for worldly
 desires, i ever enchieved them and had the better in every place, and
 never was i discomfit in no quarrel, were it right or wrong. and now i
 take upon me the adventures of holy things, and now i see and understand
 that mine old sin hindereth me and shameth me, so that i had no power to
 stir nor speak when the holy blood appeared afore me. so thus he sorrowed
 till it was day, and heard the fowls sing: then somewhat he was comforted.
 but when sir launcelot missed his horse and his harness then he wist well
 god was displeased with him.
 then he departed from the cross on foot into a forest; and so by prime he
 came to an high hill, and found an hermitage and a hermit therein which
 was going unto mass. and then launcelot kneeled down and cried on our lord
 mercy for his wicked works. so when mass was done launcelot called him,
 and prayed him for charity for to hear his life. with a good will, said
 the good man. sir, said he, be ye of king arthur's court and of the
 fellowship of the round table? yea forsooth, and my name is sir launcelot
 du lake that hath been right well said of, and now my good fortune is
 changed, for i am the most wretch of the world. the hermit beheld him and
 had marvel how he was so abashed. sir, said the hermit, ye ought to thank
 god more than any knight living, for he hath caused you to have more
 worldly worship than any knight that now liveth. and for your presumption
 to take upon you in deadly sin for to be in his presence, where his flesh
 and his blood was, that caused you ye might not see it with worldly eyes;
 for he will not appear where such sinners be, but if it be unto their
 great hurt and unto their great shame; and there is no knight living now
 that ought to give god so great thank as ye, for he hath given you beauty,
 seemliness, and great strength above all other knights; and therefore ye
 are the more beholding unto god than any other man, to love him and dread
 him, for your strength and manhood will little avail you an god be against
 you.
 chapter xx. how sir launcelot was shriven, and what sorrow he made and of
 the good ensamples which were shewed him.
 then sir launcelot wept with heavy cheer, and said: now i know well ye say
 me sooth. sir, said the good man, hide none old sin from me. truly, said
 sir launcelot, that were me full loath to discover. for this fourteen year
 i never discovered one thing that i have used, and that may i now wite my
 shame and my disadventure. and then he told there that good man all his
 life. and how he had loved a queen unmeasurably and out of measure long.
 and all my great deeds of arms that i have done, i did for the most part
 for the queen's sake, and for her sake would i do battle were it right or
 wrong, and never did i battle all only for god's sake, but for to win
 worship and to cause me to be the better beloved and little or nought i
 thanked god of it. then sir launcelot said: i pray you counsel me. i will
 counsel you, said the hermit, if ye will ensure me that ye will never come
 in that queen's fellowship as much as ye may forbear. and then sir
 launcelot promised him he nold, by the faith of his body. look that your
 heart and your mouth accord, said the good man, and i shall ensure you ye
 shall have more worship than ever ye had.
 holy father, said sir launcelot, i marvel of the voice that said to me
 marvellous words, as ye have heard to-forehand. have ye no marvel, said
 the good man thereof, for it seemeth well god loveth you; for men may
 understand a stone is hard of kind, and namely one more than another; and
 that is to understand by thee, sir launcelot, for thou wilt not leave thy
 sin for no goodness that god hath sent thee; therefore thou art more than
 any stone, and never wouldst thou be made nesh nor by water nor by fire,
 and that is the heat of the holy ghost may not enter in thee. now take
 heed, in all the world men shall not find one knight to whom our lord hath
 given so much of grace as he hath given you, for he hath given you
 fairness with seemliness, he hath given thee wit, discretion to know good
 from evil, he hath given thee prowess and hardiness, and given thee to
 work so largely that thou hast had at all days the better wheresomever
 thou came; and now our lord will suffer thee no longer, but that thou
 shalt know him whether thou wilt or nylt. and why the voice called thee
 bitterer than wood, for where overmuch sin dwelleth, there may be but
 little sweetness, wherefore thou art likened to an old rotten tree.
 now have i shewed thee why thou art harder than the stone and bitterer
 than the tree. now shall i shew thee why thou art more naked and barer
 than the fig tree. it befell that our lord on palm sunday preached in
 jerusalem, and there he found in the people that all hardness was
 harboured in them, and there he found in all the town not one that would
 harbour him. and then he went without the town, and found in midst of the
 way a fig tree, the which was right fair and well garnished of leaves, but
 fruit had it none. then our lord cursed the tree that bare no fruit; that
 betokeneth the fig tree unto jerusalem, that had leaves and no fruit. so
 thou, sir launcelot, when the holy grail was brought afore thee, he found
 in thee no fruit, nor good thought nor good will, and defouled with
 lechery. certes, said sir launcelot, all that you have said is true, and
 from henceforward i cast me, by the grace of god, never to be so wicked as
 i have been, but as to follow knighthood and to do feats of arms.
 then the good man enjoined sir launcelot such penance as he might do and
 to sewe knighthood, and so assoiled him, and prayed sir launcelot to abide
 with him all that day. i will well, said sir launcelot, for i have neither
 helm, nor horse, nor sword. as for that, said the good man, i shall help
 you or to-morn at even of an horse, and all that longed unto you. and then
 sir launcelot repented him greatly.
here endeth off the history of sir launcelot. and here followeth of sir
 percivale de galis, which is the fourteenth book.
 chapter i. how sir percivale came to a recluse and asked counsel, and how
 she told him that she was his aunt.
 now saith the tale, that when sir launcelot was ridden after sir galahad,
 the which had all these adventures above said, sir percivale turned again
 unto the recluse, where he deemed to have tidings of that knight that
 launcelot followed. and so he kneeled at her window, and the recluse
 opened it and asked sir percivale what he would. madam, he said, i am a
 knight of king arthur's court, and my name is sir percivale de galis. when
 the recluse heard his name she had great joy of him, for mickle she had
 loved him to-fore any other knight, for she ought to do so, for she was
 his aunt. and then she commanded the gates to be opened, and there he had
 all the cheer that she might make him, and all that was in her power was
 at his commandment.
 so on the morn sir percivale went to the recluse and asked her if she knew
 that knight with the white shield. sir, said she, why would ye wit? truly,
 madam, said sir percivale, i shall never be well at ease till that i know
 of that knight's fellowship, and that i may fight with him, for i may not
 leave him so lightly, for i have the shame yet. ah, percivale, said she,
 would ye fight with him? i see well ye have great will to be slain as your
 father was, through outrageousness. madam, said sir percivale, it seemeth
 by your words that ye know me. yea, said she, i well ought to know you,
 for i am your aunt, although i be in a priory place. for some called me
 sometime the queen of the waste lands, and i was called the queen of most
 riches in the world; and it pleased me never my riches so much as doth my
 poverty. then sir percivale wept for very pity when that he knew it was
 his aunt. ah, fair nephew, said she, when heard ye tidings of your mother?
 truly, said he, i heard none of her, but i dream of her much in my sleep;
 and therefore i wot not whether she be dead or alive. certes, fair nephew,
 said she, your mother is dead, for after your departing from her she took
 such a sorrow that anon, after she was confessed, she died. now, god have
 mercy on her soul, said sir percivale, it sore forthinketh me; but all we
 must change the life. now, fair aunt, tell me what is the knight? i deem
 it be he that bare the red arms on whitsunday. wit you well, said she,
 that this is he, for otherwise ought he not to do, but to go in red arms;
 and that same knight hath no peer, for he worketh all by miracle, and he
 shall never be overcome of none earthly man's hand.
 chapter ii. how merlin likened the round table to the world, and how the
 knights that should achieve the sangreal should be known.
 also merlin made the round table in tokening of roundness of the world,
 for by the round table is the world signified by right, for all the world,
 christian and heathen, repair unto the round table; and when they are
 chosen to be of the fellowship of the round table they think them more
 blessed and more in worship than if they had gotten half the world; and ye
 have seen that they have lost their fathers and their mothers, and all
 their kin, and their wives and their children, for to be of your
 fellowship. it is well seen by you; for since ye have departed from your
 mother ye would never see her, ye found such fellowship at the round
 table. when merlin had ordained the round table he said, by them which
 should be fellows of the round table the truth of the sangreal should be
 well known. and men asked him how men might know them that should best do
 and to enchieve the sangreal? then he said there should be three white
 bulls that should enchieve it, and the two should be maidens, and the
 third should be chaste. and that one of the three should pass his father
 as much as the lion passeth the leopard, both of strength and hardiness.
 they that heard merlin say so said thus unto merlin: sithen there shall be
 such a knight, thou shouldest ordain by thy crafts a siege, that no man
 should sit in it but he all only that shall pass all other knights. then
 merlin answered that he would do so. and then he made the siege perilous,
 in the which galahad sat in at his meat on whitsunday last past. now,
 madam, said sir percivale, so much have i heard of you that by my good
 will i will never have ado with sir galahad but by way of kindness; and
 for god's love, fair aunt, can ye teach me some way where i may find him?
 for much would i love the fellowship of him. fair nephew, said she, ye
 must ride unto a castle the which is called goothe, where he hath a
 cousin-germain, and there may ye be lodged this night. and as he teacheth
 you, seweth after as fast as ye can; and if he can tell you no tidings of
 him, ride straight unto the castle of carbonek, where the maimed king is
 there lying, for there shall ye hear true tidings of him.
 chapter iii. how sir percivale came into a monastery, where he found king
 evelake, which was an old man.
 then departed sir percivale from his aunt, either making great sorrow. and
 so he rode till evensong time. and then he heard a clock smite; and then
 he was ware of an house closed well with walls and deep ditches, and there
 he knocked at the gate and was let in, and he alighted and was led unto a
 chamber, and soon he was unarmed. and there he had right good cheer all
 that night; and on the morn he heard his mass, and in the monastery he
 found a priest ready at the altar. and on the right side he saw a pew
 closed with iron, and behind the altar he saw a rich bed and a fair, as of
 cloth of silk and gold.
 then sir percivale espied that therein was a man or a woman, for the
 visage was covered; then he left off his looking and heard his service.
 and when it came to the sacring, he that lay within that parclos dressed
 him up, and uncovered his head; and then him beseemed a passing old man,
 and he had a crown of gold upon his head, and his shoulders were naked and
 unhilled unto his navel. and then sir percivale espied his body was full
 of great wounds, both on the shoulders, arms, and visage. and ever he held
 up his hands against our lord's body, and cried: fair, sweet father, jesu
 christ, forget not me. and so he lay down, but always he was in his
 prayers and orisons; and him seemed to be of the age of three hundred
 winter. and when the mass was done the priest took our lord's body and
 bare it to the sick king. and when he had used it he did off his crown,
 and commanded the crown to be set on the altar.
 then sir percivale asked one of the brethren what he was. sir, said the
 good man, ye have heard much of joseph of aramathie, how he was sent by
 jesu christ into this land for to teach and preach the holy christian
 faith; and therefore he suffered many persecutions the which the enemies
 of christ did unto him, and in the city of sarras he converted a king
 whose name was evelake. and so this king came with joseph into this land,
 and ever he was busy to be thereas the sangreal was; and on a time he
 nighed it so nigh that our lord was displeased with him, but ever he
 followed it more and more, till god struck him almost blind. then this
 king cried mercy, and said: fair lord, let me never die till the good
 knight of my blood of the ninth degree be come, that i may see him openly
 that he shall enchieve the sangreal, that i may kiss him.
 chapter iv. how sir percivale saw many men of arms bearing a dead knight,
 and how he fought against them.
 when the king thus had made his prayers he heard a voice that said: heard
 be thy prayers, for thou shalt not die till he have kissed thee. and when
 that knight shall come the clearness of your eyes shall come again, and
 thou shalt see openly, and thy wounds shall be healed, and erst shall they
 never close. and this befell of king evelake, and this same king hath
 lived this three hundred winters this holy life, and men say the knight is
 in the court that shall heal him. sir, said the good man, i pray you tell
 me what knight that ye be, and if ye be of king arthur's court and of the
 table round. yea forsooth, said he, and my name is sir percivale de galis.
 and when the good man understood his name he made great joy of him.
 and then sir percivale departed and rode till the hour of noon. and he met
 in a valley about a twenty men of arms, which bare in a bier a knight
 deadly slain. and when they saw sir percivale they asked him of whence he
 was. and he answered: of the court of king arthur. then they cried all at
 once: slay him. then sir percivale smote the first to the earth and his
 horse upon him. and then seven of the knights smote upon his shield all at
 once, and the remnant slew his horse so that he fell to the earth. so had
 they slain him or taken him had not the good knight, sir galahad, with the
 red arms come there by adventure into those parts. and when he saw all
 those knights upon one knight he cried: save me that knight's life. and
 then he dressed him toward the twenty men of arms as fast as his horse
 might drive, with his spear in the rest, and smote the foremost horse and
 man to the earth. and when his spear was broken he set his hand to his
 sword, and smote on the right hand and on the left hand that it was marvel
 to see, and at every stroke he smote one down or put him to a rebuke, so
 that they would fight no more but fled to a thick forest, and sir galahad
 followed them.
 and when sir percivale saw him chase them so, he made great sorrow that
 his horse was away. and then he wist well it was sir galahad. and then he
 cried aloud: ah fair knight, abide and suffer me to do thankings unto
 thee, for much have ye done for me. but ever sir galahad rode so fast that
 at the last he passed out of his sight. and as fast as sir percivale might
 he went after him on foot, crying. and then he met with a yeoman riding
 upon an hackney, the which led in his hand a great steed blacker than any
 bear. ah, fair friend, said sir percivale, as ever i may do for you, and
 to be your true knight in the first place ye will require me, that ye will
 lend me that black steed, that i might overtake a knight the which rideth
 afore me. sir knight, said the yeoman, i pray you hold me excused of that,
 for that i may not do. for wit ye well, the horse is such a man's horse,
 that an i lent it you or any man, that he would slay me. alas, said sir
 percivale, i had never so great sorrow as i have had for losing of yonder
 knight. sir, said the yeoman, i am right heavy for you, for a good horse
 would beseem you well; but i dare not deliver you this horse but if ye
 would take him from me. that will i not do, said sir percivale. and so
 they departed; and sir percivale set him down under a tree, and made
 sorrow out of measure. and as he was there, there came a knight riding on
 the horse that the yeoman led, and he was clean armed.
 chapter v. how a yeoman desired him to get again an horse, and how sir
 percivale's hackney was slain, and how he gat an horse.
 and anon the yeoman came pricking after as fast as ever he might, and
 asked sir percivale if he saw any knight riding on his black steed. yea,
 sir, forsooth, said he; why, sir, ask ye me that? ah, sir, that steed he
 hath benome me with strength; wherefore my lord will slay me in what place
 he findeth me. well, said sir percivale, what wouldst thou that i did?
 thou seest well that i am on foot, but an i had a good horse i should
 bring him soon again. sir, said the yeoman, take mine hackney and do the
 best ye can, and i shall sewe you on foot to wit how that ye shall speed.
 then sir percivale alighted upon that hackney, and rode as fast as he
 might, and at the last he saw that knight. and then he cried: knight, turn
 again; and he turned and set his spear against sir percivale, and he smote
 the hackney in the midst of the breast that he fell down dead to the
 earth, and there he had a great fall, and the other rode his way. and then
 sir percivale was wood wroth, and cried: abide, wicked knight; coward and
 false-hearted knight, turn again and fight with me on foot. but he
 answered not, but passed on his way.
 when sir percivale saw he would not turn he cast away his helm and sword,
 and said: now am i a very wretch, cursed and most unhappy above all other
 knights. so in this sorrow he abode all that day till it was night; and
 then he was faint, and laid him down and slept till it was midnight; and
 then he awaked and saw afore him a woman which said unto him right
 fiercely: sir percivale, what dost thou here? he answered, i do neither
 good nor great ill. if thou wilt ensure me, said she, that thou wilt
 fulfil my will when i summon thee, i shall lend thee mine own horse which
 shall bear thee whither thou wilt. sir percivale was glad of her proffer,
 and ensured her to fulfil all her desire. then abide me here, and i shall
 go and fetch you an horse. and so she came soon again and brought an horse
 with her that was inly black. when percivale beheld that horse he
 marvelled that it was so great and so well apparelled; and not for then he
 was so hardy, and he leapt upon him, and took none heed of himself. and so
 anon as he was upon him he thrust to him with his spurs, and so he rode by
 a forest, and the moon shone clear. and within an hour and less he bare
 him four days' journey thence, until he came to a rough water the which
 roared, and his horse would have borne him into it.
 chapter vi. of the great danger that sir percivale was in by his horse,
 and how he saw a serpent and a lion fight.
 and when sir percivale came nigh the brim, and saw the water so boistous,
 he doubted to overpass it. and then he made a sign of the cross in his
 forehead. when the fiend felt him so charged he shook off sir percivale,
 and he went into the water crying and roaring, making great sorrow, and it
 seemed unto him that the water brent. then sir percivale perceived it was
 a fiend, the which would have brought him unto his perdition. then he
 commended himself unto god, and prayed our lord to keep him from all such
 temptations; and so he prayed all that night till on the morn that it was
 day; then he saw that he was in a wild mountain the which was closed with
 the sea nigh all about, that he might see no land about him which might
 relieve him, but wild beasts.
 and then he went into a valley, and there he saw a young serpent bring a
 young lion by the neck, and so he came by sir percivale. with that came a
 great lion crying and roaring after the serpent. and as fast as sir
 percivale saw this he marvelled, and hied him thither, but anon the lion
 had overtaken the serpent and began battle with him. and then sir
 percivale thought to help the lion, for he was the more natural beast of
 the two; and therewith he drew his sword, and set his shield afore him,
 and there he gave the serpent such a buffet that he had a deadly wound.
 when the lion saw that, he made no resemblaunt to fight with him, but made
 him all the cheer that a beast might make a man. then percivale perceived
 that, and cast down his shield which was broken; and then he did off his
 helm for to gather wind, for he was greatly enchafed with the serpent: and
 the lion went alway about him fawning as a spaniel. and then he stroked
 him on the neck and on the shoulders. and then he thanked god of the
 fellowship of that beast. and about noon the lion took his little whelp
 and trussed him and bare him there he came from.
 then was sir percivale alone. and as the tale telleth, he was one of the
 men of the world at that time which most believed in our lord jesu christ,
 for in those days there were but few folks that believed in god perfectly.
 for in those days the son spared not the father no more than a stranger.
 and so sir percivale comforted himself in our lord jesu, and besought god
 no temptation should bring him out of god's service, but to endure as his
 true champion. thus when sir percivale had prayed he saw the lion come
 toward him, and then he couched down at his feet. and so all that night
 the lion and he slept together; and when sir percivale slept he dreamed a
 marvellous dream, that there two ladies met with him, and that one sat
 upon a lion, and that other sat upon a serpent, and that one of them was
 young, and the other was old; and the youngest him thought said: sir
 percivale, my lord saluteth thee, and sendeth thee word that thou array
 thee and make thee ready, for to-morn thou must fight with the strongest
 champion of the world. and if thou be overcome thou shall not be quit for
 losing of any of thy members, but thou shalt be shamed for ever to the
 world's end. and then he asked her what was her lord. and she said the
 greatest lord of all the world: and so she departed suddenly that he wist
 not where.
 chapter vii. of the vision that sir percivale saw, and how his vision was
 expounded, and of his lion.
 then came forth the other lady that rode upon the serpent, and she said:
 sir percivale, i complain me of you that ye have done unto me, and have
 not offended unto you. certes, madam, he said, unto you nor no lady i
 never offended. yes, said she, i shall tell you why. i have nourished in
 this place a great while a serpent, which served me a great while, and
 yesterday ye slew him as he gat his prey. say me for what cause ye slew
 him, for the lion was not yours. madam, said sir percivale, i know well
 the lion was not mine, but i did it for the lion is of more gentler nature
 than the serpent, and therefore i slew him; meseemeth i did not amiss
 against you. madam, said he, what would ye that i did? i would, said she,
 for the amends of my beast that ye become my man. and then he answered:
 that will i not grant you. no, said she, truly ye were never but my
 servant sin ye received the homage of our lord jesu christ. therefore, i
 ensure you in what place i may find you without keeping i shall take you,
 as he that sometime was my man. and so she departed from sir percivale and
 left him sleeping, the which was sore travailed of his advision. and on
 the morn he arose and blessed him, and he was passing feeble.
 then was sir percivale ware in the sea, and saw a ship come sailing toward
 him; and sir percivale went unto the ship and found it covered within and
 without with white samite. and at the board stood an old man clothed in a
 surplice, in likeness of a priest. sir, said sir percivale, ye be welcome.
 god keep you, said the good man. sir, said the old man, of whence be ye?
 sir, said sir percivale, i am of king arthur's court, and a knight of the
 table round, the which am in the quest of the sangreal; and here am i in
 great duresse, and never like to escape out of this wilderness. doubt not,
 said the good man, an ye be so true a knight as the order of chivalry
 requireth, and of heart as ye ought to be, ye should not doubt that none
 enemy should slay you. what are ye? said sir percivale. sir, said the old
 man, i am of a strange country, and hither i come to comfort you.
 sir, said sir percivale, what signifieth my dream that i dreamed this
 night? and there he told him altogether: she which rode upon the lion
 betokeneth the new law of holy church, that is to understand, faith, good
 hope, belief, and baptism. for she seemed younger than the other it is
 great reason, for she was born in the resurrection and the passion of our
 lord jesu christ. and for great love she came to thee to warn thee of thy
 great battle that shall befall thee. with whom, said sir percivale, shall
 i fight? with the most champion of the world, said the old man; for as the
 lady said, but if thou quit thee well thou shalt not be quit by losing of
 one member, but thou shalt be shamed to the world's end. and she that rode
 on the serpent signifieth the old law, and that serpent betokeneth a
 fiend. and why she blamed thee that thou slewest her servant, it
 betokeneth nothing; the serpent that thou slewest betokeneth the devil
 that thou rodest upon to the rock. and when thou madest a sign of the
 cross, there thou slewest him, and put away his power. and when she asked
 thee amends and to become her man, and thou saidst thou wouldst not, that
 was to make thee to believe on her and leave thy baptism. so he commanded
 sir percivale to depart, and so he leapt over the board and the ship, and
 all went away he wist not whither. then he went up unto the rock and found
 the lion which always kept him fellowship, and he stroked him upon the
 back and had great joy of him.
 chapter viii. how sir percivale saw a ship coming to him-ward, and how the
 lady of the ship told him of her disheritance.
 by that sir percivale had abiden there till mid-day he saw a ship came
 rowing in the sea, as all the wind of the world had driven it. and so it
 drove under that rock. and when sir percivale saw this he hied him
 thither, and found the ship covered with silk more blacker than any bear,
 and therein was a gentlewoman of great beauty, and she was clothed richly
 that none might be better. and when she saw sir percivale she said: who
 brought you in this wilderness where ye be never like to pass hence, for
 ye shall die here for hunger and mischief? damosel, said sir percivale, i
 serve the best man of the world, and in his service he will not suffer me
 to die, for who that knocketh shall enter, and who that asketh shall have,
 and who that seeketh him he hideth him not. but then she said: sir
 percivale, wot ye what i am? yea, said he. now who taught you my name?
 said she. now, said sir percivale, i know you better than ye ween. and i
 came out of the waste forest where i found the red knight with the white
 shield, said the damosel. ah, damosel, said he, with that knight would i
 meet passing fain. sir knight, said she, an ye will ensure me by the faith
 that ye owe unto knighthood that ye shall do my will what time i summon
 you, and i shall bring you unto that knight. yea, said he, i shall promise
 you to fulfil your desire. well, said she, now shall i tell you. i saw him
 in the forest chasing two knights unto a water, the which is called
 mortaise; and they drove him into the water for dread of death, and the
 two knights passed over, and the red knight passed after, and there his
 horse was drenched, and he, through great strength, escaped unto the land:
 thus she told him, and sir percivale was passing glad thereof.
 then she asked him if he had ate any meat late. nay, madam, truly i ate no
 meat nigh this three days, but late here i spake with a good man that fed
 me with his good words and holy, and refreshed me greatly. ah, sir knight,
 said she, that same man is an enchanter and a multiplier of words. for an
 ye believe him ye shall plainly be shamed, and die in this rock for pure
 hunger, and be eaten with wild beasts; and ye be a young man and a goodly
 knight, and i shall help you an ye will. what are ye, said sir percivale,
 that proffered me thus great kindness? i am, said she, a gentlewoman that
 am disherited, which was sometime the richest woman of the world. damosel,
 said sir percivale, who hath disherited you? for i have great pity of you.
 sir, said she, i dwelled with the greatest man of the world, and he made
 me so fair and clear that there was none like me; and of that great beauty
 i had a little pride more than i ought to have had. also i said a word
 that pleased him not. and then he would not suffer me to be any longer in
 his company, and so drove me from mine heritage, and so disherited me, and
 he had never pity of me nor of none of my council, nor of my court. and
 sithen, sir knight, it hath befallen me so, and through me and mine i have
 benome him many of his men, and made them to become my men. for they ask
 never nothing of me but i give it them, that and much more. thus i and all
 my servants were against him night and day. therefore i know now no good
 knight, nor no good man, but i get them on my side an i may. and for that
 i know that thou art a good knight, i beseech you to help me; and for ye
 be a fellow of the round table, wherefore ye ought not to fail no
 gentlewoman which is disherited, an she besought you of help.
 chapter ix. how sir percivale promised her help, and how he required her
 of love, and how he was saved from the fiend.
 then sir percivale promised her all the help that he might; and then she
 thanked him. and at that time the weather was hot. then she called unto
 her a gentlewoman and bade her bring forth a pavilion; and so she did, and
 pight it upon the gravel. sir, said she, now may ye rest you in this heat
 of the day. then he thanked her, and she put off his helm and his shield,
 and there he slept a great while. and then he awoke and asked her if she
 had any meat, and she said: yea, also ye shall have enough. and so there
 was set enough upon the table, and thereon so much that he had marvel, for
 there was all manner of meats that he could think on. also he drank there
 the strongest wine that ever he drank, him thought, and therewith he was a
 little chafed more than he ought to be; with that he beheld the
 gentlewoman, and him thought she was the fairest creature that ever he
 saw. and then sir percivale proffered her love, and prayed her that she
 would be his. then she refused him, in a manner, when he required her, for
 the cause he should be the more ardent on her, and ever he ceased not to
 pray her of love. and when she saw him well enchafed, then she said: sir
 percivale, wit you well i shall not fulfil your will but if ye swear from
 henceforth ye shall be my true servant, and to do nothing but that i shall
 command you. will ye ensure me this as ye be a true knight? yea, said he,
 fair lady, by the faith of my body. well, said she, now shall ye do with
 me whatso it please you; and now wit ye well ye are the knight in the
 world that i have most desire to.
 and then two squires were commanded to make a bed in midst of the
 pavilion. and anon she was unclothed and laid therein. and then sir
 percivale laid him down by her naked; and by adventure and grace he saw
 his sword lie on the ground naked, in whose pommel was a red cross and the
 sign of the crucifix therein, and bethought him on his knighthood and his
 promise made to-forehand unto the good man; then he made a sign of the
 cross in his forehead, and therewith the pavilion turned up-so-down, and
 then it changed unto a smoke, and a black cloud, and then he was adread
 and cried aloud:
 chapter x. how sir percivale for penance rove himself through the thigh;
 and how she was known for the devil.
 fair sweet father, jesu christ, ne let me not be shamed, the which was
 nigh lost had not thy good grace been. and then he looked into a ship, and
 saw her enter therein, which said: sir percivale, ye have betrayed me. and
 so she went with the wind roaring and yelling, that it seemed all the
 water brent after her. then sir percivale made great sorrow, and drew his
 sword unto him, saying: sithen my flesh will be my master i shall punish
 it; and therewith he rove himself through the thigh that the blood stert
 about him, and said: o good lord, take this in recompensation of that i
 have done against thee, my lord. so then he clothed him and armed him, and
 called himself a wretch, saying: how nigh was i lost, and to have lost
 that i should never have gotten again, that was my virginity, for that may
 never be recovered after it is once lost. and then he stopped his bleeding
 wound with a piece of his shirt.
 thus as he made his moan he saw the same ship come from orient that the
 good man was in the day afore, and the noble knight was ashamed with
 himself, and therewith he fell in a swoon. and when he awoke he went unto
 him weakly, and there he saluted this good man. and then he asked sir
 percivale: how hast thou done sith i departed? sir, said he, here was a
 gentlewoman and led me into deadly sin. and there he told him altogether.
 knew ye not the maid? said the good man. sir, said he, nay, but well i wot
 the fiend sent her hither to shame me. o good knight, said he, thou art a
 fool, for that gentlewoman was the master fiend of hell, the which hath
 power above all devils, and that was the old lady that thou sawest in
 thine advision riding on the serpent. then he told sir percivale how our
 lord jesu christ beat him out of heaven for his sin, the which was the
 most brightest angel of heaven, and therefore he lost his heritage. and
 that was the champion that thou foughtest withal, the which had overcome
 thee had not the grace of god been. now beware sir percivale, and take
 this for an ensample. and then the good man vanished away. then sir
 percivale took his arms, and entered into the ship, and so departed from
 thence.
here endeth the fourteenth book, which is of sir percivale. and here
 followeth of sir launcelot, which is the fifteenth book.
 chapter i. how sir launcelot came to a chapel, where he found dead, in a
 white shirt, a man of religion, of an hundred winter old.
 when the hermit had kept sir launcelot three days, the hermit gat him an
 horse, an helm, and a sword. and then he departed about the hour of noon.
 and then he saw a little house. and when he came near he saw a chapel, and
 there beside he saw an old man that was clothed all in white full richly;
 and then sir launcelot said: god save you. god keep you, said the good
 man, and make you a good knight. then sir launcelot alighted and entered
 into the chapel, and there he saw an old man dead, in a white shirt of
 passing fine cloth.
 sir, said the good man, this man that is dead ought not to be in such
 clothing as ye see him in, for in that he brake the oath of his order, for
 he hath been more than an hundred winter a man of a religion. and then the
 good man and sir launcelot went into the chapel; and the good man took a
 stole about his neck, and a book, and then he conjured on that book; and
 with that they saw in an hideous figure and horrible, that there was no
 man so hard-hearted nor so hard but he should have been afeard. then said
 the fiend: thou hast travailed me greatly; now tell me what thou wilt with
 me. i will, said the good man, that thou tell me how my fellow became
 dead, and whether he be saved or damned. then he said with an horrible
 voice: he is not lost but saved. how may that be? said the good man; it
 seemed to me that he lived not well, for he brake his order for to wear a
 shirt where he ought to wear none, and who that trespasseth against our
 order doth not well. not so, said the fiend, this man that lieth here dead
 was come of a great lineage. and there was a lord that hight the earl de
 vale, that held great war against this man's nephew, the which hight
 aguarus. and so this aguarus saw the earl was bigger than he. then he went
 for to take counsel of his uncle, the which lieth here dead as ye may see.
 and then he asked leave, and went out of his hermitage for to maintain his
 nephew against the mighty earl; and so it happed that this man that lieth
 here dead did so much by his wisdom and hardiness that the earl was taken,
 and three of his lords, by force of this dead man.
 chapter ii. of a dead man, how men would have hewn him, and it would not
 be, and how sir launcelot took the hair of the dead man.
 then was there peace betwixt the earl and this aguarus, and great surety
 that the earl should never war against him. then this dead man that here
 lieth came to this hermitage again; and then the earl made two of his
 nephews for to be avenged upon this man. so they came on a day, and found
 this dead man at the sacring of his mass, and they abode him till he had
 said mass. and then they set upon him and drew out swords to have slain
 him; but there would no sword bite on him more than upon a gad of steel,
 for the high lord which he served he him preserved. then made they a great
 fire, and did off all his clothes, and the hair off his back. and then
 this dead man hermit said unto them: ween you to burn me? it shall not lie
 in your power nor to perish me as much as a thread, an there were any on
 my body. no? said one of them, it shall be assayed. and then they
 despoiled him, and put upon him this shirt, and cast him in a fire, and
 there he lay all that night till it was day in that fire, and was not
 dead, and so in the morn i came and found him dead; but i found neither
 thread nor skin tamed, and so took him out of the fire with great fear,
 and laid him here as ye may see. and now may ye suffer me to go my way,
 for i have said you the sooth. and then he departed with a great tempest.
 then was the good man and sir launcelot more gladder than they were
 to-fore. and then sir launcelot dwelled with that good man that night.
 sir, said the good man, be ye not sir launcelot du lake? yea, sir, said
 he. what seek ye in this country? sir, said sir launcelot, i go to seek
 the adventures of the sangreal. well, said he, seek it ye may well, but
 though it were here ye shall have no power to see it no more than a blind
 man should see a bright sword, and that is long on your sin, and else ye
 were more abler than any man living. and then sir launcelot began to weep.
 then said the good man: were ye confessed sith ye entered into the quest
 of the sangreal? yea, sir, said sir launcelot. then upon the morn when the
 good man had sung his mass, then they buried the dead man. then sir
 launcelot said: father, what shall i do? now, said the good man, i require
 you take this hair that was this holy man's and put it next thy skin, and
 it shall prevail thee greatly. sir, and i will do it, said sir launcelot.
 also i charge you that ye eat no flesh as long as ye be in the quest of
 the sangreal, nor ye shall drink no wine, and that ye hear mass daily an
 ye may do it. so he took the hair and put it upon him, and so departed at
 evensong-time.
 and so rode he into a forest, and there he met with a gentlewoman riding
 upon a white palfrey, and then she asked him: sir knight, whither ride ye?
 certes, damosel, said launcelot, i wot not whither i ride but as fortune
 leadeth me. ah, sir launcelot, said she, i wot what adventure ye seek, for
 ye were afore time nearer than ye be now, and yet shall ye see it more
 openly than ever ye did, and that shall ye understand in short time. then
 sir launcelot asked her where he might be harboured that night. ye shall
 not find this day nor night, but to-morn ye shall find harbour good, and
 ease of that ye be in doubt of and then he commended her unto god. then he
 rode till that he came to a cross, and took that for his host as for that
 night.
 chapter iii. of an advision that sir launcelot had, and how he told it to
 an hermit, and desired counsel of him.
 and so he put his horse to pasture, and did off his helm and his shield,
 and made his prayers unto the cross that he never fall in deadly sin
 again. and so he laid him down to sleep. and anon as he was asleep it
 befell him there an advision, that there came a man afore him all by
 compass of stars, and that man had a crown of gold on his head and that
 man led in his fellowship seven kings and two knights. and all these
 worshipped the cross, kneeling upon their knees, holding up their hands
 toward the heaven. and all they said: fair sweet father of heaven come and
 visit us, and yield unto us everych as we have deserved.
 then looked launcelot up to the heaven, and him seemed the clouds did
 open, and an old man came down, with a company of angels, and alighted
 among them, and gave unto everych his blessing, and called them his
 servants, and good and true knights. and when this old man had said thus
 he came to one of those knights, and said: i have lost all that i have set
 in thee, for thou hast ruled thee against me as a warrior, and used wrong
 wars with vain-glory, more for the pleasure of the world than to please
 me, therefore thou shalt be confounded without thou yield me my treasure.
 all this advision saw sir launcelot at the cross.
 and on the morn he took his horse and rode till mid-day; and there by
 adventure he met with the same knight that took his horse, helm, and his
 sword, when he slept when the sangreal appeared afore the cross. when sir
 launcelot saw him he saluted hin not fair, but cried on high: knight, keep
 thee, for thou hast done to me great unkindness. and then they put afore
 them their spears, and sir launcelot came so fiercely upon him that he
 smote him and his horse down to the earth, that he had nigh broken his
 neck. then sir launcelot took the knight's horse that was his own
 aforehand, and descended from the horse he sat upon, and mounted upon his
 own horse, and tied the knight's own horse to a tree, that he might find
 that horse when that he was arisen. then sir launcelot rode till night,
 and by adventure he met an hermit, and each of them saluted other; and
 there he rested with that good man all night, and gave his horse such as
 he might get. then said the good man unto launcelot: of whence be ye? sir,
 said he, i am of arthur's court, and my name is sir launcelot du lake that
 am in the quest of the sangreal, and therefore i pray you to counsel me of
 a vision the which i had at the cross. and so he told him all.
 chapter iv. how the hermit expounded to sir launcelot his advision, and
 told him that sir galahad was his son.
 lo, sir launcelot, said the good man, there thou mightest understand the
 high lineage that thou art come of, and thine advision betokeneth. after
 the passion of jesu christ forty year, joseph of aramathie preached the
 victory of king evelake, that he had in the battles the better of his
 enemies. and of the seven kings and the two knights: the first of them is
 called nappus, an holy man; and the second hight nacien, in remembrance of
 his grandsire, and in him dwelled our lord jesu christ; and the third was
 called helias le grose; and the fourth hight lisais; and the fifth hight
 jonas, he departed out of his country and went into wales, and took there
 the daughter of manuel, whereby he had the land of gaul, and he came to
 dwell in this country. and of him came king launcelot thy grandsire, the
 which there wedded the king's daughter of ireland, and he was as worthy a
 man as thou art, and of him came king ban, thy father, the which was the
 last of the seven kings. and by thee, sir launcelot, it signifieth that
 the angels said thou were none of the seven fellowships. and the last was
 the ninth knight, he was signified to a lion, for he should pass all
 manner of earthly knights, that is sir galahad, the which thou gat on king
 pelles' daughter; and thou ought to thank god more than any other man
 living, for of a sinner earthly thou hast no peer as in knighthood, nor
 never shall be. but little thank hast thou given to god for all the great
 virtues that god hath lent thee. sir, said launcelot, ye say that that
 good knight is my son. that oughtest thou to know and no man better, said
 the good man, for thou knewest the daughter of king pelles fleshly, and on
 her thou begattest galahad, and that was he that at the feast of pentecost
 sat in the siege perilous; and therefore make thou it known openly that he
 is one of thy begetting on king pelles' daughter, for that will be your
 worship and honour, and to all thy kindred. and i counsel you in no place
 press not upon him to have ado with him. well, said launcelot, meseemeth
 that good knight should pray for me unto the high father, that i fall not
 to sin again. trust thou well, said the good man, thou farest mickle the
 better for his prayer; but the son shall not bear the wickedness of the
 father, nor the father shall not bear the wickedness of the son, but
 everych shall bear his own burden. and therefore beseek thou only god, and
 he will help thee in all thy needs. and then sir launcelot and he went to
 supper, and so laid him to rest, and the hair pricked so sir launcelot's
 skin which grieved him full sore, but he took it meekly, and suffered the
 pain. and so on the morn he heard his mass and took his arms, and so took
 his leave.
 chapter v. how sir launcelot jousted with many knights, and how he was
 taken.
 and then mounted upon his horse, and rode into a forest, and held no
 highway. and as he looked afore him he saw a fair plain, and beside that a
 fair castle, and afore the castle were many pavilions of silk and of
 diverse hue. and him seemed that he saw there five hundred knights riding
 on horseback; and there were two parties: they that were of the castle
 were all on black horses and their trappings black, and they that were
 without were all on white horses and trappings, and everych hurtled to
 other that it marvelled sir launcelot. and at the last him thought they of
 the castle were put to the worse.
 then thought sir launcelot for to help there the weaker party in
 increasing of his chivalry. and so sir launcelot thrust in among the party
 of the castle, and smote down a knight, horse and man, to the earth. and
 then he rashed here and there, and did marvellous deeds of arms. and then
 he drew out his sword, and struck many knights to the earth, so that all
 those that saw him marvelled that ever one knight might do so great deeds
 of arms. but always the white knights held them nigh about sir launcelot,
 for to tire him and wind him. but at the last, as a man may not ever
 endure, sir launcelot waxed so faint of fighting and travailing, and was
 so weary of his great deeds, that () he might not lift up his arms for to
 give one stroke, so that he weened never to have borne arms; and then they
 all took and led him away into a forest, and there made him to alight and
 to rest him. and then all the fellowship of the castle were overcome for
 the default of him. then they said all unto sir launcelot: blessed be god
 that ye be now of our fellowship, for we shall hold you in our prison; and
 so they left
  so w. de worde; caxton "but."
 him with few words. and then sir launcelot made great sorrow, for never or
 now was i never at tournament nor jousts but i had the best, and now i am
 shamed; and then he said: now i am sure that i am more sinfuller than ever
 i was.
 thus he rode sorrowing, and half a day he was out of despair, till that he
 came into a deep valley. and when sir launcelot saw he might not ride up
 into the mountain, he there alighted under an apple tree, and there he
 left his helm and his shield, and put his horse unto pasture. and then he
 laid him down to sleep. and then him thought there came an old man afore
 him, the which said: ah, launcelot of evil faith and poor belief,
 wherefore is thy will turned so lightly toward thy deadly sin? and when he
 had said thus he vanished away, and launcelot wist not where he was
 become. then he took his horse, and armed him; and as he rode by the way
 he saw a chapel where was a recluse, which had a window that she might see
 up to the altar. and all aloud she called launcelot, for that he seemed a
 knight errant. and then he came, and she asked him what he was, and of
 what place, and where about he went to seek.
 chapter vi. how sir launcelot told his advision to a woman, and how she
 expounded it to him.
 and then he told her altogether word by word, and the truth how it befell
 him at the tournament. and after told her his advision that he had had
 that night in his sleep, and prayed her to tell him what it might mean,
 for he was not well content with it. ah, launcelot, said she, as long as
 ye were knight of earthly knighthood ye were the most marvellous man of
 the world, and most adventurous. now, said the lady, sithen ye be set
 among the knights of heavenly adventures, if adventure fell thee contrary
 at that tournament have thou no marvel, for that tournament yesterday was
 but a tokening of our lord. and not for then there was none enchantment,
 for they at the tournament were earthly knights. the tournament was a
 token to see who should have most knights, either eliazar, the son of king
 pelles, or argustus, the son of king harlon. but eliazar was all clothed
 in white, and argustus was covered in black, the which were [over]come.
 all what this betokeneth i shall tell you. the day of pentecost, when king
 arthur held his court, it befell that earthly kings and knights took a
 tournament together, that is to say the quest of the sangreal. the earthly
 knights were they the which were clothed all in black, and the covering
 betokeneth the sins whereof they be not confessed. and they with the
 covering of white betokeneth virginity, and they that chose chastity. and
 thus was the quest begun in them. then thou beheld the sinners and the
 good men, and when thou sawest the sinners overcome, thou inclinest to
 that party for bobaunce and pride of the world, and all that must be left
 in that quest, for in this quest thou shalt have many fellows and thy
 betters. for thou art so feeble of evil trust and good belief, this made
 it when thou were there where they took thee and led thee into the forest.
 and anon there appeared the sangreal unto the white knights, but thou was
 so feeble of good belief and faith that thou mightest not abide it for all
 the teaching of the good man, but anon thou turnest to the sinners, and
 that caused thy misadventure that thou should'st know good from evil and
 vain glory of the world, the which is not worth a pear. and for great
 pride thou madest great sorrow that thou hadst not overcome all the white
 knights with the covering of white, by whom was betokened virginity and
 chastity; and therefore god was wroth with you, for god loveth no such
 deeds in this quest. and this advision signifieth that thou were of evil
 faith and of poor belief, the which will make thee to fall into the deep
 pit of hell if thou keep thee not. now have i warned thee of thy vain
 glory and of thy pride, that thou hast many times erred against thy maker.
 beware of everlasting pain, for of all earthly knights i have most pity of
 thee, for i know well thou hast not thy peer of any earthly sinful man.
 and so she commended sir launcelot to dinner. and after dinner he took his
 horse and commended her to god, and so rode into a deep valley, and there
 he saw a river and an high mountain. and through the water he must needs
 pass, the which was hideous; and then in the name of god he took it with
 good heart. and when he came over he saw an armed knight, horse and man
 black as any bear; without any word he smote sir launcelot's horse to the
 earth; and so he passed on, he wist not where he was become. and then he
 took his helm and his shield, and thanked god of his adventure.
here leadeth off the story of sir launcelot, and speak we of sir
 gawaine, the which is the sixteenth book.
 chapter i. how sir gawaine was nigh weary of the quest of the sangreal,
 and of his marvellous dream.
 when sir gawaine was departed from his fellowship he rode long without any
 adventure. for he found not the tenth part of adventure as he was wont to
 do. for sir gawaine rode from whitsuntide until michaelmas and found none
 adventure that pleased him. so on a day it befell gawaine met with sir
 ector de maris, and either made great joy of other that it were marvel to
 tell. and so they told everych other, and complained them greatly that
 they could find none adventure. truly, said sir gawaine unto sir ector, i
 am nigh weary of this quest, and loath i am to follow further in strange
 countries. one thing marvelled me, said sir ector, i have met with twenty
 knights, fellows of mine, and all they complain as i do. i have marvel,
 said sir gawaine, where that sir launcelot, your brother, is. truly, said
 sir ector, i cannot hear of him, nor of sir galahad, percivale, nor sir
 bors. let them be, said sir gawaine, for they four have no peers. and if
 one thing were not in sir launcelot he had no fellow of none earthly man;
 but he is as we be, but if he took more pain upon him. but an these four
 be met together they will be loath that any man meet with them; for an
 they fail of the sangreal it is in waste of all the remnant to recover it.
 thus ector and gawaine rode more than eight days, and on a saturday they
 found an old chapel, the which was wasted that there seemed no man thither
 repaired; and there they alighted, and set their spears at the door, and
 in they entered into the chapel, and there made their orisons a great
 while, and set them down in the sieges of the chapel. and as they spake of
 one thing and other, for heaviness they fell asleep, and there befell them
 both marvellous adventures. sir gawaine him seemed he came into a meadow
 full of herbs and flowers, and there he saw a rack of bulls, an hundred
 and fifty, that were proud and black, save three of them were all white,
 and one had a black spot, and the other two were so fair and so white that
 they might be no whiter. and these three bulls which were so fair were
 tied with two strong cords. and the remnant of the bulls said among them:
 go we hence to seek better pasture. and so some went, and some came again,
 but they were so lean that they might not stand upright; and of the bulls
 that were so white, that one came again and no mo. but when this white
 bull was come again among these other there rose up a great cry for lack
 of wind that failed them; and so they departed one here and another there:
 this advision befell gawaine that night.
 chapter ii. of the advision of sir ector, and how he jousted with sir
 uwaine les avoutres, his sworn brother.
 but to ector de maris befell another vision the contrary. for it seemed
 him that his brother, sir launcelot, and he alighted out of a chair and
 leapt upon two horses, and the one said to the other: go we seek that we
 shall not find. and him thought that a man beat sir launcelot, and
 despoiled him, and clothed him in another array, the which was all full of
 knots, and set him upon an ass, and so he rode till he came to the fairest
 well that ever he saw; and sir launcelot alighted and would have drunk of
 that well. and when he stooped to drink of the water the water sank from
 him. and when sir launcelot saw that, he turned and went thither as the
 head came from. and in the meanwhile he trowed that himself and sir ector
 rode till that they came to a rich man's house where there was a wedding.
 and there he saw a king the which said: sir knight, here is no place for
 you. and then he turned again unto the chair that he came from.
 thus within a while both gawaine and ector awaked, and either told other
 of their advision, the which marvelled them greatly. truly, said ector, i
 shall never be merry till i hear tidings of my brother launcelot. now as
 they sat thus talking they saw an hand showing unto the elbow, and was
 covered with red samite, and upon that hung a bridle not right rich, and
 held within the fist a great candle which burned right clear, and so
 passed afore them, and entered into the chapel, and then vanished away and
 they wist not where. and anon came down a voice which said: knights of
 full evil faith and of poor belief, these two things have failed you, and
 therefore ye may not come to the adventures of the sangreal.
 then first spake gawaine and said: ector, have ye heard these words? yea
 truly, said sir ector, i heard all. now go we, said sir ector, unto some
 hermit that will tell us of our advision, for it seemeth me we labour all
 in vain. and so they departed and rode into a valley, and there met with a
 squire which rode on an hackney, and they saluted him fair. sir, said
 gawaine, can thou teach us to any hermit? here is one in a little
 mountain, but it is so rough there may no horse go thither, and therefore
 ye must go upon foot; there shall ye find a poor house, and there is
 nacien the hermit, which is the holiest man in this country. and so they
 departed either from other.
 and then in a valley they met with a knight all armed, which proffered
 them to joust as far as he saw them. in the name of god, said sir gawaine,
 sith i departed from camelot there was none proffered me to joust but
 once. and now, sir, said ector, let me joust with him. nay, said gawaine,
 ye shall not but if i be beat; it shall not for-think me then if ye go
 after me. and then either embraced other to joust and came together as
 fast as their horses might run, and brast their shields and the mails, and
 the one more than the other; and gawaine was wounded in the left side, but
 the other knight was smitten through the breast, and the spear came out on
 the other side, and so they fell both out of their saddles, and in the
 falling they brake both their spears.
 anon gawaine arose and set his hand to his sword, and cast his shield
 afore him. but all for naught was it, for the knight had no power to arise
 against him. then said gawaine: ye must yield you as an overcome man, or
 else i may slay you. ah, sir knight, said he, i am but dead, for god's
 sake and of your gentleness lead me here unto an abbey that i may receive
 my creator. sir, said gawaine, i know no house of religion hereby. sir,
 said the knight, set me on an horse to-fore you, and i shall teach you.
 gawaine set him up in the saddle, and he leapt up behind him for to
 sustain him, and so came to an abbey where they were well received; and
 anon he was unarmed, and received his creator. then he prayed gawaine to
 draw out the truncheon of the spear out of his body. then gawaine asked
 him what he was, that knew him not. i am, said he, of king arthur's court,
 and was a fellow of the round table, and we were brethren sworn together;
 and now sir gawaine, thou hast slain me, and my name is uwaine les
 avoutres, that sometime was son unto king uriens, and was in the quest of
 the sangreal; and now forgive it thee god, for it shall ever be said that
 the one sworn brother hath slain the other.
 chapter iii. how sir gawaine and sir ector came to an hermitage to be
 confessed, and how they told to the hermit their advisions.
 alas, said gawaine, that ever this misadventure is befallen me. no force,
 said uwaine, sith i shall die this death, of a much more worshipfuller
 man's hand might i not die; but when ye come to the court recommend me
 unto my lord, king arthur, and all those that be left alive, and for old
 brotherhood think on me. then began gawaine to weep, and ector also. and
 then uwaine himself and sir gawaine drew out the truncheon of the spear,
 and anon departed the soul from the body. then sir gawaine and sir ector
 buried him as men ought to bury a king's son, and made write upon his
 name, and by whom he was slain.
 then departed gawaine and ector, as heavy as they might for their
 misadventure, and so rode till that they came to the rough mountain, and
 there they tied their horses and went on foot to the hermitage. and when
 they were come up they saw a poor house, and beside the chapel a little
 courtelage, where nacien the hermit gathered worts, as he which had tasted
 none other meat of a great while. and when he saw the errant knights he
 came toward them and saluted them, and they him again. fair lords, said
 he, what adventure brought you hither? sir, said gawaine, to speak with
 you for to be confessed. sir, said the hermit, i am ready. then they told
 him so much that he wist well what they were. and then he thought to
 counsel them if he might.
 then began gawaine first and told him of his advision that he had had in
 the chapel, and ector told him all as it is afore rehearsed. sir, said the
 hermit unto sir gawaine, the fair meadow and the rack therein ought to be
 understood the round table, and by the meadow ought to be understood
 humility and patience, those be the things which be always green and
 quick; for men may no time overcome humility and patience, therefore was
 the round table founded, and the chivalry hath been at all times so by the
 fraternity which was there that she might not be overcome; for men said
 she was founded in patience and in humility. at the rack ate an hundred
 and fifty bulls; but they ate not in the meadow, for their hearts should
 be set in humility and patience, and the bulls were proud and black save
 only three. by the bulls is to understand the fellowship of the round
 table, which for their sin and their wickedness be black. blackness is to
 say without good or virtuous works. and the three bulls which were white
 save only one that was spotted: the two white betoken sir galahad and sir
 percivale, for they be maidens clean and without spot; and the third that
 had a spot signifieth sir bors de ganis, which trespassed but once in his
 virginity, but sithen he kept himself so well in chastity that all is
 forgiven him and his misdeeds. and why those three were tied by the necks,
 they be three knights in virginity and chastity, and there is no pride
 smitten in them. and the black bulls which said: go we hence, they were
 those which at pentecost at the high feast took upon them to go in the
 quest of the sangreal without confession: they might not enter in the
 meadow of humility and patience. and therefore they returned into waste
 countries, that signifieth death, for there shall die many of them:
 everych of them shall slay other for sin, and they that shall escape shall
 be so lean that it shall be marvel to see them. and of the three bulls
 without spot, the one shall come again, and the other two never.
 chapter iv. how the hermit expounded their advision.
 then spake nacien unto ector: sooth it is that launcelot and ye came down
 off one chair: the chair betokeneth mastership and lordship which ye came
 down from. but ye two knights, said the hermit, ye go to seek that ye
 shall never find, that is the sangreal; for it is the secret thing of our
 lord jesu christ. what is to mean that sir launcelot fell down off his
 horse: he hath left pride and taken him to humility, for he hath cried
 mercy loud for his sin, and sore repented him, and our lord hath clothed
 him in his clothing which is full of knots, that is the hair that he
 weareth daily. and the ass that he rode upon is a beast of humility, for
 god would not ride upon no steed, nor upon no palfrey; so in ensample that
 an ass betokeneth meekness, that thou sawest sir launcelot ride on in thy
 sleep. and the well whereas the water sank from him when he should have
 taken thereof, and when he saw he might not have it, he returned thither
 from whence he came, for the well betokeneth the high grace of god, the
 more men desire it to take it, the more shall be their desire. so when he
 came nigh the sangreal, he meeked him that he held him not a man worthy to
 be so nigh the holy vessel, for he had been so defouled in deadly sin by
 the space of many years; yet when he kneeled to drink of the well, there
 he saw great providence of the sangreal. and for he had served so long the
 devil, he shall have vengeance four-and-twenty days long, for that he hath
 been the devil's servant four-and-twenty years. and then soon after he
 shall return unto camelot out of this country, and he shall say a part of
 such things as he hath found.
 now will i tell you what betokeneth the hand with the candle and the
 bridle: that is to understand the holy ghost where charity is ever, and
 the bridle signifieth abstinence. for when she is bridled in christian
 man's heart she holdeth him so short that he falleth not in deadly sin.
 and the candle which sheweth clearness and sight signifieth the right way
 of jesu christ. and when he went and said: knights of poor faith and of
 wicked belief, these three things failed, charity, abstinence, and truth;
 therefore ye may not attain that high adventure of the sangreal.
 chapter v. of the good counsel that the hermit gave to them.
 certes, said gawaine, soothly have ye said, that i see it openly. now, i
 pray you, good man and holy father, tell me why we met not with so many
 adventures as we were wont to do, and commonly have the better. i shall
 tell you gladly, said the good man; the adventure of the sangreal which ye
 and many other have undertaken the quest of it and find it not, the cause
 is for it appeareth not to sinners. wherefore marvel not though ye fail
 thereof, and many other. for ye be an untrue knight and a great murderer,
 and to good men signifieth other things than murder. for i dare say, as
 sinful as sir launcelot hath been, sith that he went into the quest of the
 sangreal he slew never man, nor nought shall, till that he come unto
 camelot again, for he hath taken upon him for to forsake sin. and nere
 that he nis not stable, but by his thought he is likely to turn again, he
 should be next to enchieve it save galahad, his son. but god knoweth his
 thought and his unstableness, and yet shall he die right an holy man, and
 no doubt he hath no fellow of no earthly sinful man. sir, said gawaine, it
 seemeth me by your words that for our sins it will not avail us to travel
 in this quest truly, said the good man, there be an hundred such as ye be
 that never shall prevail, but to have shame. and when they had heard these
 voices they commended him unto god.
 then the good man called gawaine, and said: it is long time passed sith
 that ye were made knight, and never sithen thou servedst thy maker, and
 now thou art so old a tree that in thee is neither life nor fruit;
 wherefore bethink thee that thou yield to our lord the bare rind, sith the
 fiend hath the leaves and the fruit. sir, said gawaine an i had leisure i
 would speak with you, but my fellow here, sir ector, is gone, and abideth
 me yonder beneath the hill. well, said the good man, thou were better to
 be counselled. then departed gawaine and came to ector, and so took their
 horses and rode till they came to a forester's house, which harboured them
 right well. and on the morn they departed from their host, and rode long
 or they could find any adventure.
 chapter vi. how sir bors met with an hermit, and how he was confessed to
 him, and of his penance enjoined to him.
 when bors was departed from camelot he met with a religious man riding on
 an ass, and sir bors saluted him. anon the good man knew him that he was
 one of the knights-errant that was in the quest of the sangreal. what are
 ye? said the good man. sir, said he, i am a knight that fain would be
 counselled in the quest of the sangreal, for he shall have much earthly
 worship that may bring it to an end. certes, said the good man, that is
 sooth, for he shall be the best knight of the world, and the fairest of
 all the fellowship. but wit you well there shall none attain it but by
 cleanness, that is pure confession.
 so rode they together till that they came to an hermitage. and there he
 prayed bors to dwell all that night with him. and so he alighted and put
 away his armour, and prayed him that he might be confessed; and so they
 went into the chapel, and there he was clean confessed, and they ate bread
 and drank water together. now, said the good man, i pray thee that thou
 eat none other till that thou sit at the table where the sangreal shall
 be. sir, said he, i agree me thereto, but how wit ye that i shall sit
 there. yes, said the good man, that know i, but there shall be but few of
 your fellows with you. all is welcome, said sir bors, that god sendeth me.
 also, said the good man, instead of a shirt, and in sign of chastisement,
 ye shall wear a garment; therefore i pray you do off all your clothes and
 your shirt: and so he did. and then he took him a scarlet coat, so that
 should be instead of his shirt till he had fulfilled the quest of the
 sangreal; and the good man found in him so marvellous a life and so
 stable, that he marvelled and felt that he was never corrupt in fleshly
 lusts, but in one time that he begat elian le blank.
 then he armed him, and took his leave, and so departed. and so a little
 from thence he looked up into a tree, and there he saw a passing great
 bird upon an old tree, and it was passing dry, without leaves; and the
 bird sat above, and had birds, the which were dead for hunger. so smote he
 himself with his beak, the which was great and sharp. and so the great
 bird bled till that he died among his birds. and the young birds took the
 life by the blood of the great bird. when bors saw this he wist well it
 was a great tokening; for when he saw the great bird arose not, then he
 took his horse and yede his way. so by evensong, by adventure he came to a
 strong tower and an high, and there was he lodged gladly.
 chapter vii. how sir bors was lodged with a lady, and how he took upon him
 for to fight against a champion for her land.
 and when he was unarmed they led him into an high tower where was a lady,
 young, lusty, and fair. and she received him with great joy, and made him
 to sit down by her, and so was he set to sup with flesh and many dainties.
 and when sir bors saw that, he bethought him on his penance, and bade a
 squire to bring him water. and so he brought him, and he made sops therein
 and ate them. ah, said the lady, i trow ye like not my meat. yes, truly,
 said sir bors, god thank you, madam, but i may eat none other meat this
 day. then she spake no more as at that time, for she was loath to
 displease him. then after supper they spake of one thing and other.
 with that came a squire and said: madam, ye must purvey you to-morn for a
 champion, for else your sister will have this castle and also your lands,
 except ye can find a knight that will fight to-morn in your quarrel
 against pridam le noire. then she made sorrow and said: ah, lord god,
 wherefore granted ye to hold my land, whereof i should now be disherited
 without reason and right? and when sir bors had heard her say thus, he
 said: i shall comfort you. sir, said she, i shall tell you there was here
 a king that hight aniause, which held all this land in his keeping. so it
 mishapped he loved a gentlewoman a great deal elder than i. so took he her
 all this land to her keeping, and all his men to govern; and she brought
 up many evil customs whereby she put to death a great part of his kinsmen.
 and when he saw that, he let chase her out of this land, and betook it me,
 and all this land in my demesnes. but anon as that worthy king was dead,
 this other lady began to war upon me, and hath destroyed many of my men,
 and turned them against me, that i have well-nigh no man left me; and i
 have nought else but this high tower that she left me. and yet she hath
 promised me to have this tower, without i can find a knight to fight with
 her champion.
 now tell me, said sir bors, what is that pridam le noire? sir, said she,
 he is the most doubted man of this land. now may ye send her word that ye
 have found a knight that shall fight with that pridam le noire in god's
 quarrel and yours. then that lady was not a little glad, and sent word
 that she was purveyed, and that night bors had good cheer; but in no bed
 he would come, but laid him on the floor, nor never would do otherwise
 till that he had met with the quest of the sangreal.
 chapter viii. of an advision which sir bors had that night, and how he
 fought and overcame his adversary.
 and anon as he was asleep him befell a vision, that there came to him two
 birds, the one as white as a swan, and the other was marvellous black; but
 it was not so great as the other, but in the likeness of a raven. then the
 white bird came to him, and said: an thou wouldst give me meat and serve
 me i should give thee all the riches of the world, and i shall make thee
 as fair and as white as i am. so the white bird departed, and there came
 the black bird to him, and said: an thou wolt, serve me to-morrow and have
 me in no despite though i be black, for wit thou well that more availeth
 my blackness than the other's whiteness. and then he departed.
 and he had another vision: him thought that he came to a great place which
 seemed a chapel, and there he found a chair set on the left side, which
 was worm-eaten and feeble. and on the right hand were two flowers like a
 lily, and the one would have benome the other's whiteness, but a good man
 departed them that the one touched not the other; and then out of every
 flower came out many flowers, and fruit great plenty. then him thought the
 good man said: should not he do great folly that would let these two
 flowers perish for to succour the rotten tree, that it fell not to the
 earth? sir, said he, it seemeth me that this wood might not avail. now
 keep thee, said the good man, that thou never see such adventure befall
 thee.
 then he awaked and made a sign of the cross in midst of the forehead, and
 so rose and clothed him. and there came the lady of the place, and she
 saluted him, and he her again, and so went to a chapel and heard their
 service. and there came a company of knights, that the lady had sent for,
 to lead sir bors unto battle. then asked he his arms. and when he was
 armed she prayed him to take a little morsel to dine. nay, madam, said he,
 that shall i not do till i have done my battle, by the grace of god. and
 so he leapt upon his horse, and departed, all the knights and men with
 him. and as soon as these two ladies met together, she which bors should
 fight for complained her, and said: madam, ye have done me wrong to
 bereave me of my lands that king aniause gave me, and full loath i am
 there should be any battle. ye shall not choose, said the other lady, or
 else your knight withdraw him.
 then there was the cry made, which party had the better of the two
 knights, that his lady should rejoice all the land. now departed the one
 knight here, and the other there. then they came together with such a
 raundon that they pierced their shields and their hauberks, and the spears
 flew in pieces, and they wounded either other sore. then hurtled they
 together, so that they fell both to the earth, and their horses betwixt
 their legs; and anon they arose, and set hands to their swords, and smote
 each one other upon the heads, that they made great wounds and deep, that
 the blood went out of their bodies. for there found sir bors greater
 defence in that knight more than he weened. for that pridam was a passing
 good knight, and he wounded sir bors full evil, and he him again; but ever
 this pridam held the stour in like hard. that perceived sir bors, and
 suffered him till he was nigh attaint. and then he ran upon him more and
 more, and the other went back for dread of death. so in his withdrawing he
 fell upright, and sir bors drew his helm so strongly that he rent it from
 his head, and gave him great strokes with the flat of his sword upon the
 visage, and bade him yield him or he should slay him. then he cried him
 mercy and said: fair knight, for god's love slay me not, and i shall
 ensure thee never to war against thy lady, but be alway toward her. then
 bors let him be; then the old lady fled with all her knights.
 chapter ix. how the lady was returned to her lands by the battle of sir
 bors, and of his departing, and how he met sir lionel taken and beaten
 with
 thorns, and also of a maid which should have been devoured.
 so then came bors to all those that held lands of his lady, and said he
 should destroy them but if they did such service unto her as longed to
 their lands. so they did their homage, and they that would not were chased
 out of their lands. then befell that young lady to come to her estate
 again, by the mighty prowess of sir bors de ganis. so when all the country
 was well set in peace, then sir bors took his leave and departed; and she
 thanked him greatly, and would have given him great riches, but he refused
 it.
 then he rode all that day till night, and came to an harbour to a lady
 which knew him well enough, and made of him great joy. upon the morn, as
 soon as the day appeared, bors departed from thence, and so rode into a
 forest unto the hour of midday, and there befell him a marvellous
 adventure. so he met at the departing of the two ways two knights that led
 lionel, his brother, all naked, bounden upon a strong hackney, and his
 hands bounden to-fore his breast. and everych of them held in his hands
 thorns wherewith they went beating him so sore that the blood trailed down
 more than in an hundred places of his body, so that he was all blood
 to-fore and behind, but he said never a word; as he which was great of
 heart he suffered all that ever they did to him, as though he had felt
 none anguish.
 anon sir bors dressed him to rescue him that was his brother; and so he
 looked upon the other side of him, and saw a knight which brought a fair
 gentlewoman, and would have set her in the thickest place of the forest
 for to have been the more surer out of the way from them that sought him.
 and she which was nothing assured cried with an high voice: saint mary
 succour your maid. and anon she espied where sir bors came riding. and
 when she came nigh him she deemed him a knight of the round table, whereof
 she hoped to have some comfort; and then she conjured him: by the faith
 that he ought unto him in whose service thou art entered in, and for the
 faith ye owe unto the high order of knighthood, and for the noble king
 arthur's sake, that i suppose made thee knight, that thou help me, and
 suffer me not to be shamed of this knight. when bors heard her say thus he
 had so much sorrow there he nist not what to do. for if i let my brother
 be in adventure he must be slain, and that would i not for all the earth.
 and if i help not the maid she is shamed for ever, and also she shall lose
 her virginity the which she shall never get again. then lift he up his
 eyes and said weeping: fair sweet lord jesu christ, whose liege man i am,
 keep lionel, my brother, that these knights slay him not, and for pity of
 you, and for mary's sake, i shall succour this maid.
 chapter x. how sir bors left to rescue his brother, and rescued the
 damosel; and how it was told him that lionel was dead.
 then dressed he him unto the knight the which had the gentlewoman, and
 then he cried: sir knight, let your hand off that maiden, or ye be but
 dead. and then he set down the maiden, and was armed at all pieces save he
 lacked his spear. then he dressed his shield, and drew out his sword, and
 bors smote him so hard that it went through his shield and habergeon on
 the left shoulder. and through great strength he beat him down to the
 earth, and at the pulling out of bors' spear there he swooned. then came
 bors to the maid and said: how seemeth it you? of this knight ye be
 delivered at this time. now sir, said she, i pray you lead me thereas this
 knight had me. so shall i do gladly: and took the horse of the wounded
 knight, and set the gentlewoman upon him, and so brought her as she
 desired. sir knight, said she, ye have better sped than ye weened, for an
 i had lost my maidenhead, five hundred men should have died for it. what
 knight was he that had you in the forest? by my faith, said she, he is my
 cousin. so wot i never with what engine the fiend enchafed him, for
 yesterday he took me from my father privily; for i, nor none of my
 father's men, mistrusted him not, and if he had had my maidenhead he
 should have died for the sin, and his body shamed and dishonoured for
 ever. thus as she stood talking with him there came twelve knights seeking
 after her, and anon she told them all how bors had delivered her; then
 they made great joy, and besought him to come to her father, a great lord,
 and he should be right welcome. truly, said bors, that may not be at this
 time, for i have a great adventure to do in this country. so he commended
 them unto god and departed.
 then sir bors rode after lionel, his brother, by the trace of their
 horses, thus he rode seeking a great while. then he overtook a man clothed
 in a religious clothing; and rode on a strong black horse blacker than a
 berry, and said: sir knight, what seek you? sir, said he, i seek my
 brother that i saw within a while beaten with two knights. ah, bors,
 discomfort you not, nor fall into no wanhope; for i shall tell you tidings
 such as they be, for truly he is dead. then showed he him a new slain body
 lying in a bush, and it seemed him well that it was the body of lionel,
 and then he made such a sorrow that he fell to the earth all in a swoon,
 and lay a great while there. and when he came to himself he said: fair
 brother, sith the company of you and me is departed shall i never have joy
 in my heart, and now he which i have taken unto my master, he be my help.
 and when he had said thus he took his body lightly in his arms, and put it
 upon the arson of his saddle. and then he said to the man: canst thou tell
 me unto some chapel where that i may bury this body? come on, said he,
 here is one fast by; and so long they rode till they saw a fair tower, and
 afore it there seemed an old feeble chapel. and then they alighted both,
 and put him into a tomb of marble.
 chapter xi. how sir bors told his dream to a priest, which he had dreamed,
 and of the counsel that the priest gave to him.
 now leave we him here, said the good man, and go we to our harbour till
 to-morrow; we will come here again to do him service. sir, said bors, be
 ye a priest? yea forsooth, said he. then i pray you tell me a dream that
 befell to me the last night. say on, said he. then he began so much to
 tell him of the great bird in the forest, and after told him of his birds,
 one white, another black, and of the rotten tree, and of the white
 flowers. sir, i shall tell you a part now, and the other deal to-morrow.
 the white fowl betokeneth a gentlewoman, fair and rich, which loved thee
 paramours, and hath loved thee long; and if thou warn her love she shall
 go die anon, if thou have no pity on her. that signifieth the great bird,
 the which shall make thee to warn her. now for no fear that thou hast, ne
 for no dread that thou hast of god, thou shalt not warn her, but thou
 wouldst not do it for to be holden chaste, for to conquer the loos of the
 vain glory of the world; for that shall befall thee now an thou warn her,
 that launcelot, the good knight, thy cousin, shall die. and therefore men
 shall now say that thou art a manslayer, both of thy brother, sir lionel,
 and of thy cousin, sir launcelot du lake, the which thou mightest have
 saved and rescued easily, but thou weenedst to rescue a maid which
 pertaineth nothing to thee. now look thou whether it had been greater harm
 of thy brother's death, or else to have suffered her to have lost her
 maidenhood. then asked he him: hast thou heard the tokens of thy dream the
 which i have told to you? yea forsooth, said sir bors, all your exposition
 and declaring of my dream i have well understood and heard. then said the
 man in this black clothing: then is it in thy default if sir launcelot,
 thy cousin, die. sir, said bors, that were me loath, for wit ye well there
 is nothing in the world but i had liefer do it than to see my lord, sir
 launcelot du lake, to die in my default. choose ye now the one or the
 other, said the good man.
 and then he led sir bors into an high tower, and there he found knights
 and ladies: those ladies said he was welcome, and so they unarmed him. and
 when he was in his doublet men brought him a mantle furred with ermine,
 and put it about him; and then they made him such cheer that he had
 forgotten all his sorrow and anguish, and only set his heart in these
 delights and dainties, and took no thought more for his brother, sir
 lionel, neither of sir launcelot du lake, his cousin. and anon came out of
 a chamber to him the fairest lady than ever he saw, and more richer beseen
 than ever he saw queen guenever or any other estate. lo, said they, sir
 bors, here is the lady unto whom we owe all our service, and i trow she be
 the richest lady and the fairest of all the world, and the which loveth
 you best above all other knights, for she will have no knight but you. and
 when he understood that language he was abashed. not for then she saluted
 him, and he her; and then they sat down together and spake of many things,
 in so much that she besought him to be her love, for she had loved him
 above all earthly men, and she should make him richer than ever was man of
 his age. when bors understood her words he was right evil at ease, which
 in no manner would not break chastity, so wist not he how to answer her.
 chapter xii. how the devil in a woman's likeness would have had sir bors
 to have lain by her, and how by god's grace he escaped.
 alas, said she, bors, shall ye not do my will? madam, said bors, there is
 no lady in the world whose will i will fulfil as of this thing, for my
 brother lieth dead which was slain right late. ah bors, said she, i have
 loved you long for the great beauty i have seen in you, and the great
 hardiness that i have heard of you, that needs ye must lie by me this
 night, and therefore i pray you grant it me. truly, said he, i shall not
 do it in no manner wise. then she made him such sorrow as though she would
 have died. well bors, said she, unto this have ye brought me, nigh to mine
 end. and therewith she took him by the hand, and bade him behold her. and
 ye shall see how i shall die for your love. ah, said then he, that shall i
 never see.
 then she departed and went up into an high battlement, and led with her
 twelve gentlewomen; and when they were above, one of the gentlewomen
 cried, and said: ah, sir bors, gentle knight have mercy on us all, and
 suffer my lady to have her will, and if ye do not we must suffer death
 with our lady, for to fall down off this high tower, and if ye suffer us
 thus to die for so little a thing all ladies and gentlewomen will say or
 you dishonour. then looked he upward, they seemed all ladies of great
 estate, and richly and well beseen. then had he of them great pity; not
 for that he was uncounselled in himself that liefer he had they all had
 lost their souls than he his, and with that they fell adown all at once
 unto the earth. and when he saw that, he was all abashed, and had thereof
 great marvel. with that he blessed his body and his visage. and anon he
 heard a great noise and a great cry, as though all the fiends of hell had
 been about him; and therewith he saw neither tower, nor lady, nor
 gentlewoman, nor no chapel where he brought his brother to. then held he
 up both his hands to the heaven, and said: fair father god, i am
 grievously escaped; and then he took his arms and his horse and rode on
 his way.
 then he heard a clock smite on his right hand; and thither he came to an
 abbey on his right hand, closed with high walls, and there was let in.
 then they supposed that he was one of the quest of the sangreal, so they
 led him into a chamber and unarmed him. sirs, said sir bors, if there be
 any holy man in this house i pray you let me speak with him. then one of
 them led him unto the abbot, which was in a chapel. and then sir bors
 saluted him, and he him again. sir, said bors, i am a knight-errant; and
 told him all the adventure which he had seen. sir knight, said the abbot,
 i wot not what ye be, for i weened never that a knight of your age might
 have been so strong in the grace of our lord jesu christ. not for then ye
 shall go unto your rest, for i will not counsel you this day, it is too
 late, and to-morrow i shall counsel you as i can.
 chapter xiii. of the holy communication of an abbot to sir bors, and how
 the abbot counselled him.
 and that night was sir bors served richly; and on the morn early he heard
 mass, and the abbot came to him, and bade him good morrow, and bors to him
 again. and then he told him he was a fellow of the quest of the sangreal,
 and how he had charge of the holy man to eat bread and water. then [said
 the abbot]: our lord jesu christ showed him unto you in the likeness of a
 soul that suffered great anguish for us, since he was put upon the cross,
 and bled his heart-blood for mankind: there was the token and the likeness
 of the sangreal that appeared afore you, for the blood that the great fowl
 bled revived the chickens from death to life. and by the bare tree is
 betokened the world which is naked and without fruit but if it come of our
 lord. also the lady for whom ye fought for, and king aniause which was
 lord there-to-fore, betokeneth jesu christ which is the king of the world.
 and that ye fought with the champion for the lady, this it betokeneth: for
 when ye took the battle for the lady, by her shall ye understand the new
 law of jesu christ and holy church; and by the other lady ye shall
 understand the old law and the fiend, which all day warreth against holy
 church, therefore ye did your battle with right. for ye be jesu christ's
 knights, therefore ye ought to be defenders of holy church. and by the
 black bird might ye understand holy church, which sayeth i am black, but
 he is fair. and by the white bird might men understand the fiend, and i
 shall tell you how the swan is white without-forth, and black within: it
 is hypocrisy which is without yellow or pale, and seemeth without-forth
 the servants of jesu christ, but they be within so horrible of filth and
 sin, and beguile the world evil. also when the fiend appeared to thee in
 likeness of a man of religion, and blamed thee that thou left thy brother
 for a lady, so led thee where thou seemed thy brother was slain, but he is
 yet alive; and all was for to put thee in error, and bring thee unto
 wanhope and lechery, for he knew thou were tender hearted, and all was for
 thou shouldst not find the blessed adventure of the sangreal. and the
 third fowl betokeneth the strong battle against the fair ladies which were
 all devils. also the dry tree and the white lily: the dry tree betokeneth
 thy brother lionel, which is dry without virtue, and therefore many men
 ought to call him the rotten tree, and the worm-eaten tree, for he is a
 murderer and doth contrary to the order of knighthood. and the two white
 flowers signify two maidens, the one is a knight which was wounded the
 other day, and the other is the gentlewoman which ye rescued; and why the
 other flower drew nigh the other, that was the knight which would have
 defouled her and himself both. and sir bors, ye had been a great fool and
 in great peril for to have seen those two flowers perish for to succour
 the rotten tree, for an they had sinned together they had been damned; and
 for that ye rescued them both, men might call you a very knight and
 servant of jesu christ.
 chapter xiv. how sir bors met with his brother sir lionel, and how sir
 lionel would have slain sir bors.
 then went sir bors from thence and commended the abbot unto god. and then
 he rode all that day, and harboured with an old lady. and on the morn he
 rode to a castle in a valley, and there he met with a yeoman going a great
 pace toward a forest. say me, said sir bors, canst thou tell me of any
 adventure? sir, said he, here shall be under this castle a great and a
 marvellous tournament. of what folks shall it be? said sir bors. the earl
 of plains shall be in the one party, and the lady's nephew of hervin on
 the other party. then bors thought to be there if he might meet with his
 brother sir lionel, or any other of his fellowship, which were in the
 quest of the sangreal. and then he turned to an hermitage that was in the
 entry of the forest.
 and when he was come thither he found there sir lionel, his brother, which
 sat all armed at the entry of the chapel door for to abide there harbour
 till on the morn that the tournament shall be. and when sir bors saw him
 he had great joy of him, that it were marvel to tell of his joy. and then
 he alighted off his horse, and said: fair sweet brother, when came ye
 hither? anon as lionel saw him he said: ah bors, ye may not make none
 avaunt, but as for you i might have been slain; when ye saw two knights
 leading me away beating me, ye left me for to succour a gentlewoman, and
 suffered me in peril of death; for never erst ne did no brother to another
 so great an untruth. and for that misdeed now i ensure you but death, for
 well have ye deserved it; therefore keep thee from henceforward, and that
 shall ye find as soon as i am armed. when sir bors understood his
 brother's wrath he kneeled down to the earth and cried him mercy, holding
 up both his hands, and prayed him to forgive him his evil will. nay, said
 lionel, that shall never be an i may have the higher hand, that i make
 mine avow to god, thou shalt have death for it, for it were pity ye lived
 any longer.
 right so he went in and took his harness, and mounted upon his horse, and
 came to-fore him and said: bors, keep thee from me, for i shall do to thee
 as i would to a felon or a traitor, for ye be the untruest knight that
 ever came out of so worthy an house as was king bors de ganis which was
 our father, therefore start upon thy horse, and so shall ye be most at
 your advantage. and but if ye will i will run upon you thereas ye stand
 upon foot, and so the shame shall be mine and the harm yours, but of that
 shame ne reck i nought.
 when sir bors saw that he must fight with his brother or else to die, he
 nist what to do; then his heart counselled him not thereto, inasmuch as
 lionel was born or he, wherefore he ought to bear him reverence; yet
 kneeled he down afore lionel's horse's feet, and said: fair sweet brother,
 have mercy upon me and slay me not, and have in remembrance the great love
 which ought to be between us twain. what sir bors said to lionel he rought
 not, for the fiend had brought him in such a will that he should slay him.
 then when lionel saw he would none other, and that he would not have risen
 to give him battle, he rashed over him so that he smote bors with his
 horse, feet upward, to the earth, and hurt him so sore that he swooned of
 distress, the which he felt in himself to have died without confession. so
 when lionel saw this, he alighted off his horse to have smitten off his
 head. and so he took him by the helm, and would have rent it from his
 head. then came the hermit running unto him, which was a good man and of
 great age, and well had heard all the words that were between them, and so
 fell down upon sir bors.
 chapter xv. how sir colgrevance fought against sir lionel for to save sir
 bors, and how the hermit was slain.
 then he said to lionel: ah gentle knight, have mercy upon me and on thy
 brother, for if thou slay him thou shalt be dead of sin, and that were
 sorrowful, for he is one of the worthiest knights of the world, and of the
 best conditions. so god help me, said lionel, sir priest, but if ye flee
 from him i shall slay you, and he shall never the sooner be quit. certes,
 said the good man, i have liefer ye slay me than him, for my death shall
 not be great harm, not half so much as of his. well, said lionel, i am
 greed; and set his hand to his sword and smote him so hard that his head
 yede backward. not for that he restrained him of his evil will, but took
 his brother by the helm, and unlaced it to have stricken off his head, and
 had slain him without fail. but so it happed, colgrevance a fellow of the
 round table, came at that time thither as our lord's will was. and when he
 saw the good man slain he marvelled much what it might be. and then he
 beheld lionel would have slain his brother, and knew sir bors which he
 loved right well. then stert he down and took lionel by the shoulders, and
 drew him strongly aback from bors, and said: lionel, will ye slay your
 brother, the worthiest knight of the world one? and that should no good
 man suffer. why, said lionel, will ye let me? therefore if ye entermete
 you in this i shall slay you, and him after. why, said colgrevance, is
 this sooth that ye will slay him? slay him will i, said he, whoso say the
 contrary, for he hath done so much against me that he hath well deserved
 it. and so ran upon him, and would have smitten him through the head, and
 sir colgrevance ran betwixt them, and said: an ye be so hardy to do so
 more, we two shall meddle together.
 when lionel understood his words he took his shield afore him, and asked
 him what that he was. and he told him, colgrevance, one of his fellows.
 then lionel defied him, and gave him a great stroke through the helm. then
 he drew his sword, for he was a passing good knight, and defended him
 right manfully. so long dured the battle that bors rose up all anguishly,
 and beheld [how] colgrevance, the good knight, fought with his brother for
 his quarrel; then was he full sorry and heavy, and thought if colgrevance
 slew him that was his brother he should never have joy; and if his brother
 slew colgrevance the shame should ever be mine. then would he have risen
 to have departed them, but he had not so much might to stand on foot; so
 he abode him so long till colgrevance had the worse, for lionel was of
 great chivalry and right hardy, for he had pierced the hauberk and the
 helm, that he abode but death, for he had lost much of his blood that it
 was marvel that he might stand upright. then beheld he sir bors which sat
 dressing him upward and said: ah, bors, why come ye not to cast me out of
 peril of death, wherein i have put me to succour you which were right now
 nigh the death? certes, said lionel, that shall not avail you, for none of
 you shall bear others warrant, but that ye shall die both of my hand. when
 bors heard that, he did so much, he rose and put on his helm. then
 perceived he first the hermit-priest which was slain, then made he a
 marvellous sorrow upon him.
 chapter xvi. how sir lionel slew sir colgrevance, and how after he would
 have slain sir bors.
 then oft colgrevance cried upon sir bors: why will ye let me die here for
 your sake? if it please you that i die for you the death, it will please
 me the better for to save a worthy man. with that word sir lionel smote
 off the helm from his head. then colgrevance saw that he might not escape;
 then he said: fair sweet jesu, that i have misdone have mercy upon my
 soul, for such sorrow that my heart suffereth for goodness, and for alms
 deed that i would have done here, be to me aligement of penance unto my
 soul's health. at these words lionel smote him so sore that he bare him to
 the earth. so he had slain colgrevance he ran upon his brother as a
 fiendly man, and gave him such a stroke that he made him stoop. and he
 that was full of humility prayed him for god's love to leave this battle:
 for an it befell, fair brother, that i slew you or ye me, we should be
 dead of that sin. never god me help but if i have on you mercy, an i may
 have the better hand. then drew bors his sword, all weeping, and said:
 fair brother, god knoweth mine intent. ah, fair brother, ye have done full
 evil this day to slay such an holy priest the which never trespassed. also
 ye have slain a gentle knight, and one of our fellows. and well wot ye
 that i am not afeard of you greatly, but i dread the wrath of god, and
 this is an unkindly war, therefore god show miracle upon us both. now god
 have mercy upon me though i defend my life against my brother: with that
 bors lift up his hand and would have smitten his brother.
 chapter xvii. how there came a voice which charged sir bors to touch him
 not, and of a cloud that came between them.
 and then he heard a voice that said: flee bors, and touch him not, or else
 thou shalt slay him. right so alighted a cloud betwixt them in likeness of
 a fire and a marvellous flame, that both their two shields brent. then
 were they sore afraid, that they fell both to the earth, and lay there a
 great while in a swoon. and when they came to themself, bors saw that his
 brother had no harm; then he held up both his hands, for he dread god had
 taken vengeance upon him. with that he heard a voice say: bors, go hence,
 and bear thy brother no longer fellowship, but take thy way anon right to
 the sea, for sir percivale abideth thee there. then he said to his
 brother: fair sweet brother, forgive me for god's love all that i have
 trespassed unto you. then he answered: god forgive it thee and i do
 gladly.
 so sir bors departed from him and rode the next way to the sea. and at the
 last by fortune he came to an abbey which was nigh the sea. that night
 bors rested him there; and in his sleep there came a voice to him and bade
 him go to the sea. then he stert up and made a sign of the cross in the
 midst of his forehead, and took his harness, and made ready his horse, and
 mounted upon him; and at a broken wall he rode out, and rode so long till
 that he came to the sea. and on the strand he found a ship covered all
 with white samite, and he alighted, and betook him to jesu christ. and as
 soon as he entered into the ship, the ship departed into the sea, and went
 so fast that him seemed the ship went flying, but it was soon dark so that
 he might know no man, and so he slept till it was day. then he awaked, and
 saw in midst of the ship a knight lie all armed save his helm. then knew
 he that it was sir percivale of wales, and then he made of him right great
 joy; but sir percivale was abashed of him, and he asked him what he was.
 ah, fair sir, said bors, know ye me not? certes, said he, i marvel how ye
 came hither, but if our lord brought ye hither himself. then sir bors
 smiled and did off his helm. then percivale knew him, and either made
 great joy of other, that it was marvel to hear. then bors told him how he
 came into the ship, and by whose admonishment; and either told other of
 their temptations, as ye have heard to-forehand. so went they downward in
 the sea, one while backward, another while forward, and everych comforted
 other, and oft were in their prayers. then said sir percivale: we lack
 nothing but galahad, the good knight.
and thus endeth the sixteenth book, which is of sir gawaine, ector de
 maris, and sir bors de ganis, and sir percivale. and here followeth the
 seven-teenth book, which is of the noble knight sir galahad.
 chapter i. how sir galahad fought at a tournament, and how he was known of
 sir gawaine and sir ector de maris.
 now saith this story, when galahad had rescued percivale from the twenty
 knights, he yede tho into a waste forest wherein he rode many journeys;
 and he found many adventures the which he brought to an end, whereof the
 story maketh here no mention. then he took his way to the sea on a day,
 and it befell as he passed by a castle where was a wonder tournament, but
 they without had done so much that they within were put to the worse, yet
 were they within good knights enough. when galahad saw that those within
 were at so great a mischief that men slew them at the entry of the castle,
 then he thought to help them, and put a spear forth and smote the first
 that he fell to the earth, and the spear brake to pieces. then he drew his
 sword and smote thereas they were thickest, and so he did wonderful deeds
 of arms that all they marvelled. then it happed that gawaine and sir ector
 de maris were with the knights without. but when they espied the white
 shield with the red cross the one said to the other: yonder is the good
 knight, sir galahad, the haut prince: now he should be a great fool which
 should meet with him to fight. so by adventure he came by sir gawaine, and
 he smote him so hard that he clave his helm and the coif of iron unto his
 head, so that gawaine fell to the earth; but the stroke was so great that
 it slanted down to the earth and carved the horse's shoulder in two.
 when ector saw gawaine down he drew him aside, and thought it no wisdom
 for to abide him, and also for natural love, that he was his uncle. thus
 through his great hardiness he beat aback all the knights without. and
 then they within came out and chased them all about. but when galahad saw
 there would none turn again he stole away privily, so that none wist where
 he was become. now by my head, said gawaine to ector, now are the wonders
 true that were said of launcelot du lake, that the sword which stuck in
 the stone should give me such a buffet that i would not have it for the
 best castle in this world; and soothly now it is proved true, for never
 ere had i such a stroke of man's hand. sir, said ector, meseemeth your
 quest is done. and yours is not done, said gawaine, but mine is done, i
 shall seek no further. then gawaine was borne into a castle and unarmed
 him, and laid him in a rich bed, and a leech found that he might live, and
 to be whole within a month. thus gawaine and ector abode together, for sir
 ector would not away till gawaine were whole.
 and the good knight, galahad, rode so long till he came that night to the
 castle of carboneck; and it befell him thus that he was benighted in an
 hermitage. so the good man was fain when he saw he was a knight-errant.
 tho when they were at rest there came a gentlewoman knocking at the door,
 and called galahad, and so the good man came to the door to wit what she
 would. then she called the hermit: sir ulfin, i am a gentlewoman that
 would speak with the knight which is with you. then the good man awaked
 galahad, and bade him: arise, and speak with a gentlewoman that seemeth
 hath great need of you. then galahad went to her and asked her what she
 would. galahad, said she, i will that ye arm you, and mount upon your
 horse and follow me, for i shall show you within these three days the
 highest adventure that ever any knight saw. anon galahad armed him, and
 took his horse, and commended him to god, and bade the gentlewoman go, and
 he would follow thereas she liked.
 chapter ii. how sir galahad rode with a damosel, and came to the ship
 whereas sir bors and sir percivale were in.
 so she rode as fast as her palfrey might bear her, till that she came to
 the sea, the which was called collibe. and at the night they came unto a
 castle in a valley, closed with a running water, and with strong walls and
 high; and so she entered into the castle with galahad, and there had he
 great cheer, for the lady of that castle was the damosel's lady. so when
 he was unarmed, then said the damosel: madam, shall we abide here all this
 day? nay, said she, but till he hath dined and till he hath slept a
 little. so he ate and slept a while till that the maid called him, and
 armed him by torchlight. and when the maid was horsed and he both, the
 lady took galahad a fair child and rich; and so they departed from the
 castle till they came to the seaside; and there they found the ship where
 bors and percivale were in, the which cried on the ship's board: sir
 galahad, ye be welcome, we have abiden you long. and when he heard them he
 asked them what they were. sir, said she, leave your horse here, and i
 shall leave mine; and took their saddles and their bridles with them, and
 made a cross on them, and so entered into the ship. and the two knights
 received them both with great joy, and everych knew other; and so the wind
 arose, and drove them through the sea in a marvellous pace. and within a
 while it dawned.
 then did galahad off his helm and his sword, and asked of his fellows from
 whence came that fair ship. truly, said they, ye wot as well as we, but of
 god's grace; and then they told everych to other of all their hard
 adventures, and of their great temptations. truly, said galahad, ye are
 much bounden to god, for ye have escaped great adventures; and had not the
 gentlewoman been i had not come here, for as for you i weened never to
 have found you in these strange countries. ah galahad, said bors, if
 launcelot, your father, were here then were we well at ease, for then
 meseemed we failed nothing. that may not be, said galahad, but if it
 pleased our lord.
 by then the ship went from the land of logris, and by adventure it arrived
 up betwixt two rocks passing great and marvellous; but there they might
 not land, for there was a swallow of the sea, save there was another ship,
 and upon it they might go without danger. go we thither, said the
 gentlewoman, and there shall we see adventures, for so is our lord's will.
 and when they came thither they found the ship rich enough, but they found
 neither man nor woman therein. but they found in the end of the ship two
 fair letters written, which said a dreadful word and a marvellous: thou
 man, which shall enter into this ship, beware thou be in steadfast belief,
 for i am faith, and therefore beware how thou enterest, for an thou fail i
 shall not help thee. then said the gentlewoman: percivale, wot ye what i
 am? certes, said he, nay, to my witting. wit ye well, said she, that i am
 thy sister, which am daughter of king pellinore, and therefore wit ye well
 ye are the man in the world that i most love; and if ye be not in perfect
 belief of jesu christ enter not in no manner of wise, for then should ye
 perish the ship, for he is so perfect he will suffer no sinner in him.
 when percivale understood that she was his very sister he was inwardly
 glad, and said: fair sister, i shall enter therein, for if i be a
 miscreature or an untrue knight there shall i perish.
 chapter iii. how sir galahad entered into the ship, and of a fair bed
 therein, with other marvellous things, and of a sword.
 in the meanwhile galahad blessed him, and entered therein; and then next
 the gentlewoman, and then sir bors and sir percivale. and when they were
 in, it was so marvellous fair and rich that they marvelled; and in midst
 of the ship was a fair bed, and galahad went thereto, and found there a
 crown of silk. and at the feet was a sword, rich and fair, and it was
 drawn out of the sheath half a foot and more; and the sword was of divers
 fashions, and the pommel was of stone, and there was in him all manner of
 colours that any man might find, and everych of the colours had divers
 virtues; and the scales of the haft were of two ribs of divers beasts, the
 one beast was a serpent which was conversant in calidone, and is called
 the serpent of the fiend; and the bone of him is of such a virtue that
 there is no hand that handleth him shall never be weary nor hurt. and the
 other beast is a fish which is not right great, and haunteth the flood of
 euphrates; and that fish is called ertanax, and his bones be of such a
 manner of kind that who that handleth them shall have so much will that he
 shall never be weary, and he shall not think on joy nor sorrow that he
 hath had but only that thing that he beholdeth before him. and as for this
 sword there shall never man begrip him at the handles but one; but he
 shall pass all other. in the name of god, said percivale, i shall assay to
 handle it. so he set his hand to the sword, but he might not begrip it. by
 my faith, said he, now have i failed. bors set his hand thereto and
 failed.
 then galahad beheld the sword and saw letters like blood that said: let
 see who shall assay to draw me out of my sheath, but if he be more hardier
 than any other; and who that draweth me, wit ye well that he shall never
 fail of shame of his body, or to be wounded to the death. by my faith,
 said galahad, i would draw this sword out of the sheath, but the offending
 is so great that i shall not set my hand thereto. now sirs, said the
 gentlewoman, wit ye well that the drawing of this sword is warned to all
 men save all only to you. also this ship arrived in the realm of logris;
 and that time was deadly war between king labor, which was father unto the
 maimed king, and king hurlame, which was a saracen. but then was he newly
 christened, so that men held him afterward one of the wittiest men of the
 world. and so upon a day it befell that king labor and king hurlame had
 assembled their folk upon the sea where this ship was arrived; and there
 king hurlame was discomfit, and his men slain; and he was afeard to be
 dead, and fled to his ship, and there found this sword and drew it, and
 came out and found king labor, the man in the world of all christendom in
 whom was then the greatest faith. and when king hurlame saw king labor he
 dressed this sword, and smote him upon the helm so hard that he clave him
 and his horse to the earth with the first stroke of his sword. and it was
 in the realm of logris; and so befell great pestilence and great harm to
 both realms. for sithen increased neither corn, nor grass, nor well-nigh
 no fruit, nor in the water was no fish; wherefore men call it the lands of
 the two marches, the waste land, for that dolorous stroke. and when king
 hurlame saw this sword so carving, he turned again to fetch the scabbard,
 and so came into this ship and entered, and put up the sword in the
 sheath. and as soon as he had done it he fell down dead afore the bed.
 thus was the sword proved, that none ne drew it but he were dead or
 maimed. so lay he there till a maiden came into the ship and cast him out,
 for there was no man so hardy of the world to enter into that ship for the
 defence.
 chapter iv. of the marvels of the sword and of the scabbard.
 and then beheld they the scabbard, it seemed to be of a serpent's skin,
 and thereon were letters of gold and silver. and the girdle was but poorly
 to come to, and not able to sustain such a rich sword. and the letters
 said: he which shall wield me sought to be more harder than any other, if
 he bear me as truly as me ought to be borne. for the body of him which i
 ought to hang by, he shall not be shamed in no place while he is girt with
 this girdle, nor never none be so hardy to do away this girdle; for it
 ought not be done away but by the hands of a maid, and that she be a
 king's daughter and queen's, and she must be a maid all the days of her
 life, both in will and in deed. and if she break her virginity she shall
 die the most villainous death that ever died any woman. sir, said
 percivale, turn this sword that we may see what is on the other side. and
 it was red as blood, with black letters as any coal, which said: he that
 shall praise me most, most shall he find me to blame at a great need; and
 to whom i should be most debonair shall i be most felon, and that shall be
 at one time.
 fair brother, said she to percivale, it befell after a forty year after
 the passion of jesu christ that nacien, the brother-in-law of king
 mordrains, was borne into a town more than fourteen days' journey from his
 country, by the commandment of our lord, into an isle, into the parts of
 the west, that men cleped the isle of turnance. so befell it that he found
 this ship at the entry of a rock, and he found the bed and this sword as
 we have heard now. not for then he had not so much hardiness to draw it;
 and there he dwelled an eight days, and at the ninth day there fell a
 great wind which departed him out of the isle, and brought him to another
 isle by a rock, and there he found the greatest giant that ever man might
 see. therewith came that horrible giant to slay him; and then he looked
 about him and might not flee, and he had nothing to defend him with. so he
 ran to his sword, and when he saw it naked he praised it much, and then he
 shook it, and therewith he brake it in the midst. ah, said nacien, the
 thing that i most praised ought i now most to blame, and therewith he
 threw the pieces of his sword over his bed. and after he leapt over the
 board to fight with the giant, and slew him.
 and anon he entered into the ship again, and the wind arose, and drove him
 through the sea, that by adventure he came to another ship where king
 mordrains was, which had been tempted full evil with a fiend in the port
 of perilous rock. and when that one saw the other they made great joy of
 other, and either told other of their adventure, and how the sword failed
 him at his most need when mordrains saw the sword he praised it much: but
 the breaking was not to do but by wickedness of thy selfward, for thou art
 in some sin. and there he took the sword, and set the pieces together, and
 they soldered as fair as ever they were to-fore; and there put he the
 sword in the sheath, and laid it down on the bed. then heard they a voice
 that said: go out of this ship a little while, and enter into the other,
 for dread ye fall in deadly sin, for and ye be found in deadly sin ye may
 not escape but perish: and so they went into the other ship. and as nacien
 went over the board he was smitten with a sword on the right foot, that he
 fell down noseling to the ship's board; and therewith he said: o god, how
 am i hurt. and then there came a voice and said: take thou that for thy
 forfeit that thou didst in drawing of this sword, therefore thou receivest
 a wound, for thou were never worthy to handle it, as the writing maketh
 mention. in the name of god, said galahad, ye are right wise of these
 works.
 chapter v. how king pelles was smitten through both thighs because he drew
 the sword, and other marvellous histories.
 sir, said she, there was a king that hight pelles, the maimed king. and
 while he might ride he supported much christendom and holy church. so upon
 a day he hunted in a wood of his which lasted unto the sea; and at the
 last he lost his hounds and his knights save only one: and there he and
 his knight went till that they came toward ireland, and there he found the
 ship. and when he saw the letters and understood them, yet he entered, for
 he was right perfect of his life, but his knight had none hardiness to
 enter; and there found he this sword, and drew it out as much as ye may
 see. so therewith entered a spear wherewith he was smitten him through
 both the thighs, and never sith might he be healed, nor nought shall
 to-fore we come to him. thus, said she, was not king pelles, your
 grandsire, maimed for his hardiness? in the name of god, damosel, said
 galahad.
 so they went toward the bed to behold all about it, and above the head
 there hung two swords. also there were two spindles which were as white as
 any snow, and other that were as red as blood, and other above green as
 any emerald: of these three colours were the spindles, and of natural
 colour within, and without any painting. these spindles, said the damosel,
 were when sinful eve came to gather fruit, for which adam and she were put
 out of paradise, she took with her the bough on which the apple hung on.
 then perceived she that the branch was fair and green, and she remembered
 her the loss which came from the tree. then she thought to keep the branch
 as long as she might. and for she had no coffer to keep it in, she put it
 in the earth. so by the will of our lord the branch grew to a great tree
 within a little while, and was as white as any snow, branches, boughs, and
 leaves: that was a token a maiden planted it. but after god came to adam,
 and bade him know his wife fleshly as nature required. so lay adam with
 his wife under the same tree; and anon the tree which was white was full
 green as any grass, and all that came out of it; and in the same time that
 they medled together there was abel begotten: thus was the tree long of
 green colour. and so it befell many days after, under the same tree caym
 slew abel, whereof befell great marvel. for anon as abel had received the
 death under the green tree, it lost the green colour and became red; and
 that was in tokening of the blood. and anon all the plants died thereof,
 but the tree grew and waxed marvellously fair, and it was the fairest tree
 and the most delectable that any man might behold and see; and so died the
 plants that grew out of it to-fore that abel was slain under it. so long
 dured the tree till that solomon, king david's son, reigned, and held the
 land after his father. this solomon was wise and knew all the virtues of
 stones and trees, and so he knew the course of the stars, and many other
 divers things. this solomon had an evil wife, wherethrough he weened that
 there had been no good woman, and so he despised them in his books. so
 answered a voice him once: solomon, if heaviness come to a man by a woman,
 ne reck thou never; for yet shall there come a woman whereof there shall
 come greater joy to man an hundred times more than this heaviness giveth
 sorrow; and that woman shall be born of thy lineage. tho when solomon
 heard these words he held himself but a fool, and the truth he perceived
 by old books. also the holy ghost showed him the coming of the glorious
 virgin mary. then asked he of the voice, if it should be in the yerde of
 his lineage. nay, said the voice, but there shall come a man which shall
 be a maid, and the last of your blood, and he shall be as good a knight as
 duke josua, thy brother-in-law.
 chapter vi. how solomon took david's sword by the counsel of his wife, and
 of other matters marvellous.
 now have i certified thee of that thou stoodest in doubt. then was solomon
 glad that there should come any such of his lineage; but ever he marvelled
 and studied who that should be, and what his name might be. his wife
 perceived that he studied, and thought she would know it at some season;
 and so she waited her time, and asked of him the cause of his studying,
 and there he told her altogether how the voice told him. well, said she, i
 shall let make a ship of the best wood and most durable that men may find.
 so solomon sent for all the carpenters of the land, and the best. and when
 they had made the ship the lady said to solomon: sir, said she, since it
 is so that this knight ought to pass all knights of chivalry which have
 been to-fore him and shall come after him, moreover i shall tell you, said
 she, ye shall go into our lord's temple, where is king david's sword, your
 father, the which is the marvelloust and the sharpest that ever was taken
 in any knight's hand. therefore take that, and take off the pommel, and
 thereto make ye a pommel of precious stones, that it be so subtly made
 that no man perceive it but that they be all one; and after make there an
 hilt so marvellously and wonderly that no man may know it; and after make
 a marvellous sheath. and when ye have made all this i shall let make a
 girdle thereto, such as shall please me.
 all this king solomon did let make as she devised, both the ship and all
 the remnant. and when the ship was ready in the sea to sail, the lady let
 make a great bed and marvellous rich, and set her upon the bed's head,
 covered with silk, and laid the sword at the feet, and the girdles were of
 hemp, and therewith the king was angry. sir, wit ye well, said she, that i
 have none so high a thing which were worthy to sustain so high a sword,
 and a maid shall bring other knights thereto, but i wot not when it shall
 be, nor what time. and there she let make a covering to the ship, of cloth
 of silk that should never rot for no manner of weather. yet went that lady
 and made a carpenter to come to the tree which abel was slain under. now,
 said she, carve me out of this tree as much wood as will make me a
 spindle. ah madam, said he, this is the tree the which our first mother
 planted. do it, said she, or else i shall destroy thee. anon as he began
 to work there came out drops of blood; and then would he have left, but
 she would not suffer him, and so he took away as much wood as might make a
 spindle: and so she made him to take as much of the green tree and of the
 white tree. and when these three spindles were shapen she made them to be
 fastened upon the selar of the bed. when solomon saw this, he said to his
 wife: ye have done marvellously, for though all the world were here right
 now, he could not devise wherefore all this was made, but our lord
 himself; and thou that hast done it wottest not what it shall betoken. now
 let it be, said she, for ye shall hear tidings sooner than ye ween. now
 shall ye hear a wonderful tale of king solomon and his wife.
 chapter vii. a wonderful tale of king solomon and his wife.
 that night lay solomon before the ship with little fellowship. and when he
 was asleep him thought there came from heaven a great company of angels,
 and alighted into the ship, and took water which was brought by an angel,
 in a vessel of silver, and sprent all the ship. and after he came to the
 sword, and drew letters on the hilt. and after went to the ship's board,
 and wrote there other letters which said: thou man that wilt enter within
 me, beware that thou be full within the faith, for i ne am but faith and
 belief. when solomon espied these letters he was abashed, so that he durst
 not enter, and so drew him aback; and the ship was anon shoven in the sea,
 and he went so fast that he lost sight of him within a little while. and
 then a little voice said: solomon, the last knight of thy lineage shall
 rest in this bed. then went solomon and awaked his wife, and told her of
 the adventures of the ship.
 now saith the history that a great while the three fellows beheld the bed
 and the three spindles. then they were at certain that they were of
 natural colours without painting. then they lift up a cloth which was
 above the ground, and there found a rich purse by seeming. and percivale
 took it, and found therein a writ and so he read it, and devised the
 manner of the spindles and of the ship, whence it came, and by whom it was
 made. now, said galahad, where shall we find the gentlewoman that shall
 make new girdles to the sword? fair sir, said percivale's sister, dismay
 you not, for by the leave of god i shall let make a girdle to the sword,
 such one as shall long thereto. and then she opened a box, and took out
 girdles which were seemly wrought with golden threads, and upon that were
 set full precious stones, and a rich buckle of gold. lo, lords, said she,
 here is a girdle that ought to be set about the sword. and wit ye well the
 greatest part of this girdle was made of my hair, which i loved well while
 that i was a woman of the world. but as soon as i wist that this adventure
 was ordained me i clipped off my hair, and made this girdle in the name of
 god. ye be well found, said sir bors, for certes ye have put us out of
 great pain, wherein we should have entered ne had your tidings been.
 then went the gentlewoman and set it on the girdle of the sword. now, said
 the fellowship, what is the name of the sword, and what shall we call it?
 truly, said she, the name of the sword is the sword with the strange
 girdles; and the sheath, mover of blood; for no man that hath blood in him
 ne shall never see the one part of the sheath which was made of the tree
 of life. then they said to galahad: in the name of jesu christ, and pray
 you that ye gird you with this sword which hath been desired so much in
 the realm of logris. now let me begin, said galahad, to grip this sword
 for to give you courage; but wit ye well it longeth no more to me than it
 doth to you. and then he gripped about it with his fingers a great deal;
 and then she girt him about the middle with the sword. now reck i not
 though i die, for now i hold me one of the blessed maidens of the world,
 which hath made the worthiest knight of the world. damosel, said galahad,
 ye have done so much that i shall be your knight all the days of my life.
 then they went from that ship, and went to the other. and anon the wind
 drove them into the sea a great pace, but they had no victuals: but it
 befell that they came on the morn to a castle that men call carteloise,
 that was in the marches of scotland. and when they had passed the port,
 the gentlewoman said: lords, here be men arriven that, an they wist that
 ye were of king arthur's court, ye should be assailed anon. damosel, said
 galahad, he that cast us out of the rock shall deliver us from them.
 chapter viii. how galahad and his fellows came to a castle, and how they
 were fought withal, and how they slew their adversaries, and other
 matters.
 so it befell as they spoke thus there came a squire by them, and asked
 what they were; and they said they were of king arthur's house. is that
 sooth? said he. now by my head, said he, ye be ill arrayed; and then
 turned he again unto the cliff fortress. and within a while they heard an
 horn blow. then a gentlewoman came to them, and asked them of whence they
 were; and they told her. fair lords, said she, for god's love turn again
 if ye may, for ye be come unto your death. nay, they said, we will not
 turn again, for he shall help us in whose service we be entered in. then
 as they stood talking there came knights well armed, and bade them yield
 them or else to die. that yielding, said they, shall be noyous to you. and
 therewith they let their horses run, and sir percivale smote the foremost
 to the earth, and took his horse, and mounted thereupon, and the same did
 galahad. also bors served another so, for they had no horses in that
 country, for they left their horses when they took their ship in other
 countries. and so when they were horsed then began they to set upon them;
 and they of the castle fled into the strong fortress, and the three
 knights after them into the castle, and so alighted on foot, and with
 their swords slew them down, and gat into the hall.
 then when they beheld the great multitude of people that they had slain,
 they held themself great sinners. certes, said bors, i ween an god had
 loved them that we should not have had power to have slain them thus. but
 they have done so much against our lord that he would not suffer them to
 reign no longer. say ye not so, said galahad, for if they misdid against
 god, the vengeance is not ours, but to him which hath power thereof.
 so came there out of a chamber a good man which was a priest, and bare
 god's body in a cup. and when he saw them which lay dead in the hall he
 was all abashed; and galahad did off his helm and kneeled down, and so did
 his two fellows. sir, said they, have ye no dread of us, for we be of king
 arthur's court. then asked the good man how they were slain so suddenly,
 and they told it him. truly, said the good man, an ye might live as long
 as the world might endure, ne might ye have done so great an alms-deed as
 this. sir, said galahad, i repent me much, inasmuch as they were
 christened. nay, repent you not, said he, for they were not christened,
 and i shall tell you how that i wot of this castle. here was lord earl
 hernox not but one year, and he had three sons, good knights of arms, and
 a daughter, the fairest gentlewoman that men knew. so those three knights
 loved their sister so sore that they brent in love, and so they lay by
 her, maugre her head. and for she cried to her father they slew her, and
 took their father and put him in prison, and wounded him nigh to the
 death, but a cousin of hers rescued him. and then did they great untruth:
 they slew clerks and priests, and made beat down chapels, that our lord's
 service might not be served nor said. and this same day her father sent to
 me for to be confessed and houseled; but such shame had never man as i had
 this day with the three brethren, but the earl bade me suffer, for he said
 they should not long endure, for three servants of our lord should destroy
 them, and now it is brought to an end. and by this may ye wit that our
 lord is not displeased with your deeds. certes, said galahad, an it had
 not pleased our lord, never should we have slain so many men in so little
 a while.
 and then they brought the earl hernox out of prison into the midst of the
 hall, that knew galahad anon, and yet he saw him never afore but by
 revelation of our lord.
 chapter ix. how the three knights, with percivale's sister, came unto the
 same forest, and of an hart and four lions, and other things.
 then began he to weep right tenderly, and said: long have i abiden your
 coming, but for god's love hold me in your arms, that my soul may depart
 out of my body in so good a man's arms as ye be. gladly, said galahad. and
 then one said on high, that all heard: galahad, well hast thou avenged me
 on god's enemies. now behoveth thee to go to the maimed king as soon as
 thou mayest, for he shall receive by thee health which he hath abiden so
 long. and therewith the soul departed from the body, and galahad made him
 to be buried as him ought to be.
 right so departed the three knights, and percivale's sister with them. and
 so they came into a waste forest, and there they saw afore them a white
 hart which four lions led. then they took them to assent for to follow
 after for to know whither they repaired; and so they rode after a great
 pace till that they came to a valley, and thereby was an hermitage where a
 good man dwelled, and the hart and the lions entered also. so when they
 saw all this they turned to the chapel, and saw the good man in a
 religious weed and in the armour of our lord, for he would sing mass of
 the holy ghost; and so they entered in and heard mass. and at the secrets
 of the mass they three saw the hart become a man, the which marvelled
 them, and set him upon the altar in a rich siege; and saw the four lions
 were changed, the one to the form of a man, the other to the form of a
 lion, and the third to an eagle, and the fourth was changed unto an ox.
 then took they their siege where the hart sat, and went out through a
 glass window, and there was nothing perished nor broken; and they heard a
 voice say: in such a manner entered the son of god in the womb of a maid
 mary, whose virginity ne was perished ne hurt. and when they heard these
 words they fell down to the earth and were astonied; and therewith was a
 great clearness.
 and when they were come to theirself again they went to the good man and
 prayed him that he would say them truth. what thing have ye seen? said he.
 and they told him all that they had seen. ah lords, said he, ye be
 welcome; now wot i well ye be the good knights the which shall bring the
 sangreal to an end; for ye be they unto whom our lord shall shew great
 secrets. and well ought our lord be signified to an hart, for the hart
 when he is old he waxeth young again in his white skin. right so cometh
 again our lord from death to life, for he lost earthly flesh that was the
 deadly flesh, which he had taken in the womb of the blessed virgin mary;
 and for that cause appeared our lord as a white hart without spot. and the
 four that were with him is to understand the four evangelists which set in
 writing a part of jesu christ's deeds that he did sometime when he was
 among you an earthly man; for wit ye well never erst ne might no knight
 know the truth, for ofttimes or this our lord showed him unto good men and
 unto good knights, in likeness of an hart, but i suppose from henceforth
 ye shall see no more. and then they joyed much, and dwelled there all that
 day. and upon the morrow when they had heard mass they departed and
 commended the good man to god: and so they came to a castle and passed by.
 so there came a knight armed after them and said: lords, hark what i shall
 say to you.
 chapter x. how they were desired of a strange custom, the which they would
 not obey; wherefore they fought and slew many knights.
 this gentlewoman that ye lead with you is a maid? sir, said she, a maid i
 am. then he took her by the bridle and said: by the holy cross, ye shall
 not escape me to-fore ye have yolden the custom of this castle. let her
 go, said percivale, ye be not wise, for a maid in what place she cometh is
 free. so in the meanwhile there came out a ten or twelve knights armed,
 out of the castle, and with them came gentlewomen which held a dish of
 silver. and then they said: this gentlewoman must yield us the custom of
 this castle. sir, said a knight, what maid passeth hereby shall give this
 dish full of blood of her right arm. blame have ye, said galahad, that
 brought up such customs, and so god me save, i ensure you of this
 gentlewoman ye shall fail while that i live. so god me help, said
 percivale, i had liefer be slain. and i also, said sir bors. by my troth,
 said the knight, then shall ye die, for ye may not endure against us
 though ye were the best knights of the world.
 then let they run each to other, and the three fellows beat the ten
 knights, and then set their hands to their swords and beat them down and
 slew them. then there came out of the castle a three score knights armed.
 fair lords, said the three fellows, have mercy on yourself and have not
 ado with us. nay, fair lords, said the knights of the castle, we counsel
 you to withdraw you, for ye be the best knights of the world, and
 therefore do no more, for ye have done enough. we will let you go with
 this harm, but we must needs have the custom. certes, said galahad, for
 nought speak ye. well, said they, will ye die? we be not yet come thereto,
 said galahad. then began they to meddle together, and galahad, with the
 strange girdles, drew his sword, and smote on the right hand and on the
 left hand, and slew what that ever abode him, and did such marvels that
 there was none that saw him but weened he had been none earthly man, but a
 monster. and his two fellows halp him passing well, and so they held the
 journey everych in like hard till it was night: then must they needs
 depart.
 so came in a good knight, and said to the three fellows: if ye will come
 in to-night and take such harbour as here is ye shall be right welcome,
 and we shall ensure you by the faith of our bodies, and as we be true
 knights, to leave you in such estate to-morrow as we find you, without any
 falsehood. and as soon as ye know of the custom we dare say ye will accord
 therefore. for god's love, said the gentlewoman, go thither and spare not
 for me. go we, said galahad; and so they entered into the chapel. and when
 they were alighted they made great joy of them. so within a while the
 three knights asked the custom of the castle and wherefore it was. what it
 is, said they, we will say you sooth.
 chapter xi. how sir percivale's sister bled a dish full of blood for to
 heal a lady, wherefore she died; and how that the body was put in a ship.
 there is in this castle a gentlewoman which we and this castle is hers,
 and many other. so it befell many years agone there fell upon her a
 malady; and when she had lain a great while she fell unto a measle, and of
 no leech she could have no remedy. but at the last an old man said an she
 might have a dish full of blood of a maid and a clean virgin in will and
 in work, and a king's daughter, that blood should be her health, and for
 to anoint her withal; and for this thing was this custom made. now, said
 percivale's sister, fair knights, i see well that this gentlewoman is but
 dead. certes, said galahad, an ye bleed so much ye may die. truly, said
 she, an i die for to heal her i shall get me great worship and soul's
 health, and worship to my lineage, and better is one harm than twain. and
 therefore there shall be no more battle, but to-morn i shall yield you
 your custom of this castle. and then there was great joy more than there
 was to-fore, for else had there been mortal war upon the morn;
 notwithstanding she would none other, whether they wold or nold.
 that night were the three fellows eased with the best; and on the morn
 they heard mass, and sir percivale's sister bade bring forth the sick
 lady. so she was, the which was evil at ease. then said she: who shall let
 me blood? so one came forth and let her blood, and she bled so much that
 the dish was full. then she lift up her hand and blessed her; and then she
 said to the lady: madam, i am come to the death for to make you whole, for
 god's love pray for me. with that she fell in a swoon. then galahad and
 his two fellows start up to her, and lift her up and staunched her, but
 she had bled so much that she might not live. then she said when she was
 awaked: fair brother percivale, i die for the healing of this lady, so i
 require you that ye bury me not in this country, but as soon as i am dead
 put me in a boat at the next haven, and let me go as adventure will lead
 me; and as soon as ye three come to the city of sarras, there to enchieve
 the holy grail, ye shall find me under a tower arrived, and there bury me
 in the spiritual place; for i say you so much, there galahad shall be
 buried, and ye also, in the same place.
 then percivale understood these words, and granted it her, weeping. and
 then said a voice: lords and fellows, to-morrow at the hour of prime ye
 three shall depart everych from other, till the adventure bring you to the
 maimed king. then asked she her saviour; and as soon as she had received
 it the soul departed from the body. so the same day was the lady healed,
 when she was anointed withal. then sir percivale made a letter of all that
 she had holpen them as in strange adventures, and put it in her right
 hand, and so laid her in a barge, and covered it with black silk; and so
 the wind arose, and drove the barge from the land, and all knights beheld
 it till it was out of their sight. then they drew all to the castle, and
 so forthwith there fell a sudden tempest and a thunder, lightning, and
 rain, as all the earth would have broken. so half the castle turned
 up-so-down. so it passed evensong or the tempest was ceased.
 then they saw afore them a knight armed and wounded hard in the body and
 in the head, that said: o god, succour me for now it is need. after this
 knight came another knight and a dwarf, which cried to them afar: stand,
 ye may not escape. then the wounded knight held up his hands to god that
 he should not die in such tribulation. truly, said galahad, i shall
 succour him for his sake that he calleth upon. sir, said bors, i shall do
 it, for it is not for you, for he is but one knight. sir, said he, i
 grant. so sir bors took his horse, and commended him to god, and rode
 after, to rescue the wounded knight. now turn we to the two fellows.
 chapter xii. how galahad and percivale found in a castle many tombs of
 maidens that had bled to death.
 now saith the story that all night galahad and percivale were in a chapel
 in their prayers, for to save sir bors. so on the morrow they dressed them
 in their harness toward the castle, to wit what was fallen of them
 therein. and when they came there they found neither man nor woman that he
 ne was dead by the vengeance of our lord. with that they heard a voice
 that said: this vengeance is for blood-shedding of maidens. also they
 found at the end of the chapel a churchyard, and therein might they see a
 three score fair tombs, and that place was so fair and so delectable that
 it seemed them there had been none tempest, for there lay the bodies of
 all the good maidens which were martyred for the sick lady's sake. also
 they found the names of everych, and of what blood they were come, and all
 were of kings' blood, and twelve of them were kings' daughters. then they
 departed and went into a forest. now, said percivale unto galahad, we must
 depart, so pray we our lord that we may meet together in short time: then
 they did off their helms and kissed together, and wept at their departing.
 chapter xiii. how sir launcelot entered into the ship where sir
 percivale's sister lay dead, and how he met with sir galahad, his son.
 now saith the history, that when launcelot was come to the water of
 mortoise, as it is rehearsed before, he was in great peril, and so he laid
 him down and slept, and took the adventure that god would send him. so
 when he was asleep there came a vision unto him and said: launcelot, arise
 up and take thine armour, and enter into the first ship that thou shalt
 find. and when he heard these words he start up and saw great clearness
 about him. and then he lift up his hand and blessed him, and so took his
 arms and made him ready; and so by adventure he came by a strand, and
 found a ship the which was without sail or oar. and as soon as he was
 within the ship there he felt the most sweetness that ever he felt, and he
 was fulfilled with all thing that he thought on or desired. then he said:
 fair sweet father, jesu christ, i wot not in what joy i am, for this joy
 passeth all earthly joys that ever i was in. and so in this joy he laid
 him down to the ship's board, and slept till day. and when he awoke he
 found there a fair bed, and therein lying a gentlewoman dead, the which
 was sir percivale's sister. and as launcelot devised her, he espied in her
 right hand a writ, the which he read, the which told him all the
 adventures that ye have heard to-fore, and of what lineage she was come.
 so with this gentlewoman sir launcelot was a month and more. if ye would
 ask how he lived, he that fed the people of israel with manna in the
 desert, so was he fed; for every day when he had said his prayers he was
 sustained with the grace of the holy ghost.
 so on a night he went to play him by the water side, for he was somewhat
 weary of the ship. and then he listened and heard an horse come, and one
 riding upon him. and when he came nigh he seemed a knight. and so he let
 him pass, and went thereas the ship was; and there he alighted, and took
 the saddle and the bridle and put the horse from him, and went into the
 ship. and then launcelot dressed unto him, and said: ye be welcome. and he
 answered and saluted him again, and asked him: what is your name? for much
 my heart giveth unto you. truly, said he, my name is launcelot du lake.
 sir, said he, then be ye welcome, for ye were the beginner of me in this
 world. ah, said he, are ye galahad? yea, forsooth, said he; and so he
 kneeled down and asked him his blessing, and after took off his helm and
 kissed him. and there was great joy between them, for there is no tongue
 can tell the joy that they made either of other, and many a friendly word
 spoken between, as kin would, the which is no need here to be rehearsed.
 and there everych told other of their adventures and marvels that were
 befallen to them in many journeys sith that they departed from the court.
 anon, as galahad saw the gentlewoman dead in the bed, he knew her well
 enough, and told great worship of her, that she was the best maid living,
 and it was great pity of her death. but when launcelot heard how the
 marvellous sword was gotten, and who made it, and all the marvels
 rehearsed afore, then he prayed galahad, his son, that he would show him
 the sword, and so he did; and anon he kissed the pommel, and the hilt, and
 the scabbard. truly, said launcelot, never erst knew i of so high
 adventures done, and so marvellous and strange. so dwelt launcelot and
 galahad within that ship half a year, and served god daily and nightly
 with all their power; and often they arrived in isles far from folk, where
 there repaired none but wild beasts, and there they found many strange
 adventures and perilous, which they brought to an end; but for those
 adventures were with wild beasts, and not in the quest of the sangreal,
 therefore the tale maketh here no mention thereof, for it would be too
 long to tell of all those adventures that befell them.
 chapter xiv. how a knight brought unto sir galahad a horse, and bade him
 come from his father, sir launcelot.
 so after, on a monday, it befell that they arrived in the edge of a forest
 to-fore a cross; and then saw they a knight armed all in white, and was
 richly horsed, and led in his right hand a white horse; and so he came to
 the ship, and saluted the two knights on the high lord's behalf, and said:
 galahad, sir, ye have been long enough with your father, come out of the
 ship, and start upon this horse, and go where the adventures shall lead
 thee in the quest of the sangreal. then he went to his father and kissed
 him sweetly, and said: fair sweet father, i wot not when i shall see you
 more till i see the body of jesu christ. i pray you, said launcelot, pray
 ye to the high father that he hold me in his service. and so he took his
 horse, and there they heard a voice that said: think for to do well, for
 the one shall never see the other before the dreadful day of doom. now,
 son galahad, said launcelot, since we shall depart, and never see other, i
 pray to the high father to conserve me and you both. sir, said galahad, no
 prayer availeth so much as yours and therewith galahad entered into the
 forest.
 and the wind arose, and drove launcelot more than a month throughout the
 sea, where he slept but little, but prayed to god that he might see some
 tidings of the sangreal. so it befell on a night, at midnight, he arrived
 afore a castle, on the back side, which was rich and fair, and there was a
 postern opened toward the sea, and was open without any keeping, save two
 lions kept the entry; and the moon shone clear. anon sir launcelot heard a
 voice that said: launcelot, go out of this ship and enter into the castle,
 where thou shalt see a great part of thy desire. then he ran to his arms,
 and so armed him, and so went to the gate and saw the lions. then set he
 hand to his sword and drew it. then there came a dwarf suddenly, and smote
 him on the arm so sore that the sword fell out of his hand. then heard he
 a voice say: o man of evil faith and poor belief, wherefore trowest thou
 more on thy harness than in thy maker, for he might more avail thee than
 thine armour, in whose service that thou art set. then said launcelot:
 fair father jesu christ, i thank thee of thy great mercy that thou
 reprovest me of my misdeed; now see i well that ye hold me for your
 servant. then took he again his sword and put it up in his sheath, and
 made a cross in his forehead, and came to the lions, and they made
 semblaunt to do him harm. notwithstanding he passed by them without hurt,
 and entered into the castle to the chief fortress, and there were they all
 at rest. then launcelot entered in so armed, for he found no gate nor door
 but it was open. and at the last he found a chamber whereof the door was
 shut, and he set his hand thereto to have opened it, but he might not.
 chapter xv. how sir launcelot was to-fore the door of the chamber wherein
 the holy sangreal was.
 then he enforced him mickle to undo the door. then he listened and heard a
 voice which sang so sweetly that it seemed none earthly thing; and him
 thought the voice said: joy and honour be to the father of heaven. then
 launcelot kneeled down to-fore the chamber, for well wist he that there
 was the sangreal within that chamber. then said he: fair sweet father,
 jesu christ, if ever i did thing that pleased thee, lord for thy pity
 never have me not in despite for my sins done aforetime, and that thou
 show me something of that i seek. and with that he saw the chamber door
 open, and there came out a great clearness, that the house was as bright
 as all the torches of the world had been there.
 so came he to the chamber door, and would have entered. and anon a voice
 said to him: flee, launcelot, and enter not, for thou oughtest not to do
 it; and if thou enter thou shalt for-think it. then he withdrew him aback
 right heavy. then looked he up in the midst of the chamber, and saw a
 table of silver, and the holy vessel, covered with red samite, and many
 angels about it, whereof one held a candle of wax burning, and the other
 held a cross, and the ornaments of an altar. and before the holy vessel he
 saw a good man clothed as a priest. and it seemed that he was at the sacring
 of the mass. and it seemed to launcelot that above the priest's hands were
 three men, whereof the two put the youngest by likeness between the
 priest's hands; and so he lift it up right high, and it seemed to show so
 to the people. and then launcelot marvelled not a little, for him thought
 the priest was so greatly charged of the figure that him seemed that he
 should fall to the earth. and when he saw none about him that would help
 him, then came he to the door a great pace, and said: fair father jesu
 christ, ne take it for no sin though i help the good man which hath great
 need of help.
 right so entered he into the chamber, and came toward the table of silver;
 and when he came nigh he felt a breath, that him thought it was
 intermeddled with fire, which smote him so sore in the visage that him
 thought it brent his visage; and therewith he fell to the earth, and had
 no power to arise, as he that was so araged, that had lost the power of
 his body, and his hearing, and his seeing. then felt he many hands about
 him, which took him up and bare him out of the chamber door, without any
 amending of his swoon, and left him there, seeming dead to all people.
 so upon the morrow when it was fair day they within were arisen, and found
 launcelot lying afore the chamber door. all they marvelled how that he
 came in, and so they looked upon him, and felt his pulse to wit whether
 there were any life in him; and so they found life in him, but he might
 not stand nor stir no member that he had. and so they took him by every
 part of the body, and bare him into a chamber, and laid him in a rich bed,
 far from all folk; and so he lay four days. then the one said he was
 alive, and the other said, nay. in the name of god, said an old man, for i
 do you verily to wit he is not dead, but he is so full of life as the
 mightiest of you all; and therefore i counsel you that he be well kept
 till god send him life again.
 chapter xvi. how sir launcelot had lain four-and-twenty days and as many
 nights as a dead man, and other divers matters.
 in such manner they kept launcelot four-and-twenty days and all so many
 nights, that ever he lay still as a dead man; and at the twenty-fifth day
 befell him after midday that he opened his eyes. and when he saw folk he
 made great sorrow, and said: why have ye awaked me, for i was more at ease
 than i am now. o jesu christ, who might be so blessed that might see
 openly thy great marvels of secretness there where no sinner may be! what
 have ye seen? said they about him. i have seen, said he, so great marvels
 that no tongue may tell, and more than any heart can think, and had not my
 son been here afore me i had seen much more.
 then they told him how he had lain there four-and-twenty days and nights.
 then him thought it was punishment for the four-and-twenty years that he
 had been a sinner, wherefore our lord put him in penance four-and-twenty
 days and nights. then looked sir launcelot afore him, and saw the hair
 which he had borne nigh a year, for that he for-thought him right much
 that he had broken his promise unto the hermit, which he had avowed to do.
 then they asked how it stood with him. forsooth, said he, i am whole of
 body, thanked be our lord; therefore, sirs, for god's love tell me where i
 am. then said they all that he was in the castle of carbonek.
 therewith came a gentlewoman and brought him a shirt of small linen cloth,
 but he changed not there, but took the hair to him again. sir, said they,
 the quest of the sangreal is achieved now right in you, that never shall
 ye see of the sangreal no more than ye have seen. now i thank god, said
 launcelot, of his great mercy of that i have seen, for it sufficeth me;
 for as i suppose no man in this world hath lived better than i have done
 to enchieve that i have done. and therewith he took the hair and clothed
 him in it, and above that he put a linen shirt, and after a robe of
 scarlet, fresh and new. and when he was so arrayed they marvelled all, for
 they knew him that he was launcelot, the good knight. and then they said
 all: o my lord sir launcelot, be that ye? and he said: truly i am he.
 then came word to king pelles that the knight that had lain so long dead
 was sir launcelot. then was the king right glad, and went to see him. and
 when launcelot saw him come he dressed him against him, and there made the
 king great joy of him. and there the king told him tidings that his fair
 daughter was dead. then launcelot was right heavy of it, and said: sir, me
 forthinketh the death of your daughter, for she was a full fair lady,
 fresh and young. and well i wot she bare the best knight that is now on
 the earth, or that ever was sith god was born. so the king held him there
 four days, and on the morrow he took his leave at king pelles and at all
 the fellowship, and thanked them of their great labour.
 right so as they sat at their dinner in the chief salle, then was so
 befallen that the sangreal had fulfilled the table with all manner of
 meats that any heart might think. so as they sat they saw all the doors
 and the windows of the place were shut without man's hand, whereof they
 were all abashed, and none wist what to do.
 and then it happed suddenly a knight came to the chief door and knocked,
 and cried: undo the door. but they would not. and ever he cried: undo; but
 they would not. and at last it noyed them so much that the king himself
 arose and came to a window there where the knight called. then he said:
 sir knight, ye shall not enter at this time while the sangreal is here,
 and therefore go into another; for certes ye be none of the knights of the
 quest, but one of them which hath served the fiend, and hast left the
 service of our lord: and he was passing wroth at the king's words. sir
 knight, said the king, sith ye would so fain enter, say me of what country
 ye be. sir, said he, i am of the realm of logris, and my name is ector de
 maris, and brother unto my lord, sir launcelot. in the name of god, said
 the king, me for-thinketh of what i have said, for your brother is here
 within. and when ector de maris understood that his brother was there, for
 he was the man in the world that he most dread and loved, and then he
 said: ah god, now doubleth my sorrow and shame. full truly said the good
 man of the hill unto gawaine and to me of our dreams. then went he out of
 the court as fast as his horse might, and so throughout the castle.
 chapter xvii. how sir launcelot returned towards logris, and of other
 adventures which he saw in the way.
 then king pelles came to sir launcelot and told him tidings of his
 brother, whereof he was sorry, that he wist not what to do. so sir
 launcelot departed, and took his arms, and said he would go see the realm
 of logris, which i have not seen in twelve months. and there with he
 commended the king to god, and so rode through many realms. and at the
 last he came to a white abbey, and there they made him that night great
 cheer; and on the morn he rose and heard mass. and afore an altar he found
 a rich tomb, which was newly made; and then he took heed, and saw the
 sides written with gold which said: here lieth king bagdemagus of gore,
 which king arthur's nephew slew; and named him, sir gawaine. then was not
 he a little sorry, for launcelot loved him much more than any other, and
 had it been any other than gawaine he should not have escaped from death
 to life; and said to himself: ah lord god, this is a great hurt unto king
 arthur's court, the loss of such a man. and then he departed and came to
 the abbey where galahad did the adventure of the tombs, and won the white
 shield with the red cross; and there had he great cheer all that night.
 and on the morn he turned unto camelot, where he found king arthur and the
 queen. but many of the knights of the round table were slain and
 destroyed, more than half. and so three were come home, ector, gawaine,
 and lionel, and many other that need not to be rehearsed. and all the
 court was passing glad of sir launcelot, and the king asked him many
 tidings of his son galahad. and there launcelot told the king of his
 adventures that had befallen him since he departed. and also he told him
 of the adventures of galahad, percivale, and bors, which that he knew by
 the letter of the dead damosel, and as galahad had told him. now god
 would, said the king, that they were all three here. that shall never be,
 said launcelot, for two of them shall ye never see, but one of them shall
 come again.
 now leave we this story and speak of galahad.
 chapter xviii. how galahad came to king mordrains, and of other matters
 and adventures.
 now, saith the story, galahad rode many journeys in vain. and at the last
 he came to the abbey where king mordrains was, and when he heard that, he
 thought he would abide to see him. and upon the morn, when he had heard
 mass, galahad came unto king mordrains, and anon the king saw him, which
 had lain blind of long time. and then he dressed him against him, and
 said: galahad, the servant of jesu christ, whose coming i have abiden so
 long, now embrace me and let me rest on thy breast, so that i may rest
 between thine arms, for thou art a clean virgin above all knights, as the
 flower of the lily in whom virginity is signified, and thou art the rose
 the which is the flower of all good virtues, and in colour of fire. for
 the fire of the holy ghost is taken so in thee that my flesh which was all
 dead of oldness is become young again. then galahad heard his words, then
 he embraced him and all his body. then said he: fair lord jesu christ, now
 i have my will. now i require thee, in this point that i am in, thou come
 and visit me. and anon our lord heard his prayer: therewith the soul
 departed from the body.
 and then galahad put him in the earth as a king ought to be, and so
 departed and so came into a perilous forest where he found the well the
 which boileth with great waves, as the tale telleth to-fore. and as soon
 as galahad set his hand thereto it ceased, so that it brent no more, and
 the heat departed. for that it brent it was a sign of lechery, the which
 was that time much used. but that heat might not abide his pure virginity.
 and this was taken in the country for a miracle. and so ever after was it
 called galahad's well.
 then by adventure he came into the country of gore, and into the abbey
 where launcelot had been to-forehand, and found the tomb of king
 bagdemagus, but he was founder thereof, joseph of aramathie's son; and the
 tomb of simeon where launcelot had failed. then he looked into a croft
 under the minster, and there he saw a tomb which brent full marvellously.
 then asked he the brethren what it was. sir, said they, a marvellous
 adventure that may not be brought unto none end but by him that passeth of
 bounty and of knighthood all them of the round table. i would, said
 galahad, that ye would lead me thereto. gladly, said they, and so led him
 till a cave. and he went down upon greses, and came nigh the tomb. and
 then the flaming failed, and the fire staunched, the which many a day had
 been great. then came there a voice that said: much are ye beholden to
 thank our lord, the which hath given you a good hour, that ye may draw out
 the souls of earthly pain, and to put them into the joys of paradise. i am
 of your kindred, the which hath dwelled in this heat this three hundred
 winter and four-and-fifty to be purged of the sin that i did against
 joseph of aramathie. then galahad took the body in his arms and bare it
 into the minster. and that night lay galahad in the abbey; and on the morn
 he gave him service, and put him in the earth afore the high altar.
 chapter xix. how sir percivale and sir bors met with sir galahad, and how
 they came to the castle of carbonek, and other matters.
 so departed he from thence, and commended the brethren to god; and so he
 rode five days till that he came to the maimed king. and ever followed
 percivale the five days, asking where he had been; and so one told him how
 the adventures of logris were enchieved. so on a day it befell that they
 came out of a great forest, and there they met at traverse with sir bors,
 the which rode alone. it is none need to tell if they were glad; and them
 he saluted, and they yielded him honour and good adventure, and everych
 told other. then said bors: it is mo than a year and an half that i ne lay
 ten times where men dwelled, but in wild forests and in mountains, but god
 was ever my comfort.
 then rode they a great while till that they came to the castle of
 carbonek. and when they were entered within the castle king pelles knew
 them; then there was great joy, for they wist well by their coming that
 they had fulfilled the quest of the sangreal. then eliazar, king pelles'
 son, brought to-fore them the broken sword wherewith joseph was stricken
 through the thigh. then bors set his hand thereto, if that he might have
 soldered it again; but it would not be. then he took it to percivale, but
 he had no more power thereto than he. now have ye it again, said percivale
 to galahad, for an it be ever enchieved by any bodily man ye must do it.
 and then he took the pieces and set them together, and they seemed that
 they had never been broken, and as well as it had been first forged. and
 when they within espied that the adventure of the sword was enchieved,
 then they gave the sword to bors, for it might not be better set; for he
 was a good knight and a worthy man.
 and a little afore even the sword arose great and marvellous, and was full
 of great heat that many men fell for dread. and anon alighted a voice
 among them, and said: they that ought not to sit at the table of jesu
 christ arise, for now shall very knights be fed. so they went thence, all
 save king pelles and eliazar, his son, the which were holy men, and a maid
 which was his niece; and so these three fellows and they three were there,
 no mo. anon they saw knights all armed came in at the hall door, and did
 off their helms and their arms, and said unto galahad: sir, we have hied
 right much for to be with you at this table where the holy meat shall be
 departed. then said he: ye be welcome, but of whence be ye? so three of
 them said they were of gaul, and other three said they were of ireland,
 and the other three said they were of denmark. so as they sat thus there
 came out a bed of tree, of a chamber, the which four gentlewomen brought;
 and in the bed lay a good man sick, and a crown of gold upon his head; and
 there in the midst of the place they set him down, and went again their
 way. then he lift up his head, and said: galahad, knight, ye be welcome,
 for much have i desired your coming, for in such pain and in such anguish
 i have been long. but now i trust to god the term is come that my pain
 shall be allayed, that i shall pass out of this world so as it was
 promised me long ago. therewith a voice said: there be two among you that
 be not in the quest of the sangreal, and therefore depart ye.
 chapter xx how galahad and his fellows were fed of the holy sangreal, and
 how our lord appeared to them, and other things.
 then king pelles and his son departed. and therewithal beseemed them that
 there came a man, and four angels from heaven, clothed in likeness of a
 bishop, and had a cross in his hand; and these four angels bare him up in
 a chair, and set him down before the table of silver where upon the
 sangreal was; and it seemed that he had in midst of his forehead letters
 the which said: see ye here joseph, the first bishop of christendom, the
 same which our lord succoured in the city of sarras in the spiritual
 place. then the knights marvelled, for that bishop was dead more than
 three hundred year to-fore. o knights, said he, marvel not, for i was
 sometime an earthly man. with that they heard the chamber door open, and
 there they saw angels; and two bare candles of wax, and the third a towel,
 and the fourth a spear which bled marvellously, that three drops fell
 within a box which he held with his other hand. and they set the candles
 upon the table, and the third the towel upon the vessel, and the fourth
 the holy spear even upright upon the vessel. and then the bishop made
 semblaunt as though he would have gone to the sacring of the mass. and
 then he took an ubblie which was made in likeness of bread. and at the
 lifting up there came a figure in likeness of a child, and the visage was
 as red and as bright as any fire, and smote himself into the bread, so
 that they all saw it that the bread was formed of a fleshly man; and then
 he put it into the holy vessel again, and then he did that longed to a
 priest to do to a mass. and then he went to galahad and kissed him, and
 bade him go and kiss his fellows: and so he did anon. now, said he,
 servants of jesu christ, ye shall be fed afore this table with sweet meats
 that never knights tasted. and when he had said, he vanished away. and
 they set them at the table in great dread, and made their prayers.
 then looked they and saw a man come out of the holy vessel, that had all
 the signs of the passion of jesu christ, bleeding all openly, and said: my
 knights, and my servants, and my true children, which be come out of
 deadly life into spiritual life, i will now no longer hide me from you,
 but ye shall see now a part of my secrets and of my hidden things: now
 hold and receive the high meat which ye have so much desired. then took he
 himself the holy vessel and came to galahad; and he kneeled down, and
 there he received his saviour, and after him so received all his fellows;
 and they thought it so sweet that it was marvellous to tell. then said he
 to galahad: son, wottest thou what i hold betwixt my hands? nay, said he,
 but if ye will tell me. this is, said he, the holy dish wherein i ate the
 lamb on sheer-thursday. and now hast thou seen that thou most desired to
 see, but yet hast thou not seen it so openly as thou shalt see it in the
 city of sarras in the spiritual place. therefore thou must go hence and
 bear with thee this holy vessel; for this night it shall depart from the
 realm of logris, that it shall never be seen more here. and wottest thou
 wherefore? for he is not served nor worshipped to his right by them of
 this land, for they be turned to evil living; therefore i shall disherit
 them of the honour which i have done them. and therefore go ye three
 to-morrow unto the sea, where ye shall find your ship ready, and with you
 take the sword with the strange girdles, and no more with you but sir
 percivale and sir bors. also i will that ye take with you of the blood of
 this spear for to anoint the maimed king, both his legs and all his body,
 and he shall have his health. sir, said galahad, why shall not these other
 fellows go with us? for this cause: for right as i departed my apostles
 one here and another there, so i will that ye depart; and two of you shall
 die in my service, but one of you shall come again and tell tidings. then
 gave he them his blessing and vanished away.
 chapter xxi. how galahad anointed with the blood of the spear the maimed
 king, and of other adventures.
 and galahad went anon to the spear which lay upon the table, and touched
 the blood with his fingers, and came after to the maimed king and anointed
 his legs. and therewith he clothed him anon, and start upon his feet out
 of his bed as an whole man, and thanked our lord that he had healed him.
 and that was not to the worldward, for anon he yielded him to a place of
 religion of white monks, and was a full holy man. that same night about
 midnight came a voice among them which said: my sons and not my chief
 sons, my friends and not my warriors, go ye hence where ye hope best to do
 and as i bade you. ah, thanked' be thou, lord, that thou wilt vouchsafe to
 call us, thy sinners. now may we well prove that we have not lost our
 pains. and anon in all haste they took their harness and departed. but the
 three knights of gaul, one of them hight claudine, king claudas' son, and
 the other two were great gentlemen. then prayed galahad to everych of
 them, that if they come to king arthur's court that they should salute my
 lord, sir launcelot, my father, and all the fellowship () of the round
 table; and prayed them if that they came on that part that they should not
 forget it.
 right so departed galahad, percivale and bors with him; and so they rode
 three days, and then they came to a rivage, and found the ship whereof the
 tale speaketh of
  so w. de worde; caxton "of them."
 to-fore. and when they came to the board they found in the midst the table
 of silver which they had left with the maimed king, and the sangreal which
 was covered with red samite. then were they glad to have such things in
 their fellowship; and so they entered and made great reverence thereto;
 and galahad fell in his prayer long time to our lord, that at what time he
 asked, that he should pass out of this world. so much he prayed till a
 voice said to him: galahad, thou shalt have thy request; and when thou
 askest the death of thy body thou shalt have it, and then shalt thou find
 the life of the soul. percivale heard this, and prayed him, of fellowship
 that was between them, to tell him wherefore he asked such things. that
 shall i tell you, said galahad; the other day when we saw a part of the
 adventures of the sangreal i was in such a joy of heart, that i trow never
 man was that was earthly. and therefore i wot well, when my body is dead
 my soul shall be in great joy to see the blessed trinity every day, and
 the majesty of our lord, jesu christ.
 so long were they in the ship that they said to galahad: sir, in this bed
 ought ye to lie, for so saith the scripture. and so he laid him down and
 slept a great while; and when he awaked he looked afore him and saw the
 city of sarras. and as they would have landed they saw the ship wherein
 percivale had put his sister in. truly, said percivale, in the name of
 god, well hath my sister holden us covenant. then took they out of the
 ship the table of silver, and he took it to percivale and to bors, to go
 to-fore, and galahad came behind. and right so they went to the city, and
 at the gate of the city they saw an old man crooked. then galahad called
 him and bade him help to bear this heavy thing. truly, said the old man,
 it is ten year ago that i might not go but with crutches. care thou not,
 said galahad, and arise up and shew thy good will. and so he assayed, and
 found himself as whole as ever he was. than ran he to the table, and took
 one part against galahad. and anon arose there great noise in the city,
 that a cripple was made whole by knights marvellous that entered into the
 city.
 then anon after, the three knights went to the water, and brought up into
 the palace percivale's sister, and buried her as richly as a king's
 daughter ought to be. and when the king of the city, which was cleped
 estorause, saw the fellowship, he asked them of whence they were, and what
 thing it was that they had brought upon the table of silver. and they told
 him the truth of the sangreal, and the power which that god had sent
 there. then the king was a tyrant, and was come of the line of paynims,
 and took them and put them in prison in a deep hole.
 chapter xxii. how they were fed with the sangreal while they were in
 prison, and how galahad was made king.
 but as soon as they were there our lord sent them the sangreal, through
 whose grace they were always fulfilled while that they were in prison. so
 at the year's end it befell that this king estorause lay sick, and felt
 that he should die. then he sent for the three knights, and they came
 afore him; and he cried them mercy of that he had done to them, and they
 forgave it him goodly; and he died anon. when the king was dead all the
 city was dismayed, and wist not who might be their king. right so as they
 were in counsel there came a voice among them, and bade them choose the
 youngest knight of them three to be their king: for he shall well maintain
 you and all yours. so they made galahad king by all the assent of the holy
 city, and else they would have slain him. and when he was come to behold
 the land, he let make above the table of silver a chest of gold and of
 precious stones, that hilled the holy vessel. and every day early the
 three fellows would come afore it, and make their prayers.
 now at the year's end, and the self day after galahad had borne the crown
 of gold, he arose up early and his fellows, and came to the palace, and
 saw to-fore them the holy vessel, and a man kneeling on his knees in
 likeness of a bishop, that had about him a great fellowship of angels, as
 it had been jesu christ himself; and then he arose and began a mass of our
 lady. and when he came to the sacrament of the mass, and had done, anon he
 called galahad, and said to him: come forth the servant of jesu christ,
 and thou shalt see that thou hast much desired to see. and then he began
 to tremble right hard when the deadly flesh began to behold the spiritual
 things. then he held up his hands toward heaven and said: lord, i thank
 thee, for now i see that that hath been my desire many a day. now, blessed
 lord, would i not longer live, if it might please thee, lord. and
 therewith the good man took our lord's body betwixt his hands, and
 proffered it to galahad, and he received it right gladly and meekly. now
 wottest thou what i am? said the good man. nay, said galahad. i am joseph
 of aramathie, the which our lord hath sent here to thee to bear thee
 fellowship; and wottest thou wherefore that he hath sent me more than any
 other? for thou hast resembled me in two things; in that thou hast seen
 the marvels of the sangreal, in that thou hast been a clean maiden, as i
 have been and am.
 and when he had said these words galahad went to percivale and kissed him,
 and commended him to god; and so he went to sir bors and kissed him, and
 commended him to god, and said: fair lord, salute me to my lord, sir
 launcelot, my father, and as soon as ye see him, bid him remember of this
 unstable world. and therewith he kneeled down to-fore the table and made
 his prayers, and then suddenly his soul departed to jesu christ, and a
 great multitude of angels bare his soul up to heaven, that the two fellows
 might well behold it. also the two fellows saw come from heaven an hand,
 but they saw not the body. and then it came right to the vessel, and took
 it and the spear, and so bare it up to heaven. sithen was there never man
 so hardy to say that he had seen the sangreal.
 chapter xxiii. of the sorrow that percivale and bors made when galahad was
 dead: and of percivale how he died, and other matters.
 when percivale and bors saw galahad dead they made as much sorrow as ever
 did two men. and if they had not been good men they might lightly have
 fallen in despair. and the people of the country and of the city were
 right heavy. and then he was buried; and as soon as he was buried sir
 percivale yielded him to an hermitage out of the city, and took a
 religious clothing. and bors was alway with him, but never changed he his
 secular clothing, for that he purposed him to go again into the realm of
 logris. thus a year and two months lived sir percivale in the hermitage a
 full holy life, and then passed out of this world; and bors let bury him
 by his sister and by galahad in the spiritualities.
 when bors saw that he was in so far countries as in the parts of babylon
 he departed from sarras, and armed him and came to the sea, and entered
 into a ship; and so it befell him in good adventure he came into the realm
 of logris; and he rode so fast till he came to camelot where the king was.
 and then was there great joy made of him in the court, for they weened all
 he had been dead, forasmuch as he had been so long out of the country. and
 when they had eaten, the king made great clerks to come afore him, that
 they should chronicle of the high adventures of the good knights. when
 bors had told him of the adventures of the sangreal, such as had befallen
 him and his three fellows, that was launcelot, percivale, galahad, and
 himself, there launcelot told the adventures of the sangreal that he had
 seen. all this was made in great books, and put up in almeries at
 salisbury. and anon sir bors said to sir launcelot: galahad, your own son,
 saluted you by me, and after you king arthur and all the court, and so did
 sir percivale, for i buried them with mine own hands in the city of
 sarras. also, sir launcelot, galahad prayed you to remember of this
 unsiker world as ye behight him when ye were together more than half a
 year. this is true, said launcelot; now i trust to god his prayer shall
 avail me.
 then launcelot took sir bors in his arms, and said: gentle cousin, ye are
 right welcome to me, and all that ever i may do for you and for yours ye
 shall find my poor body ready at all times, while the spirit is in it, and
 that i promise you faithfully, and never to fail. and wit ye well, gentle
 cousin, sir bors, that ye and i will never depart asunder whilst our lives
 may last. sir, said he, i will as ye will.
thus endeth the history of the sangreal, that was briefly drawn out of
 french into english, the which is a story chronicled for one of the truest
 and the holiest that is in this world, the which is the xvii book.
and here followeth the eighteenth book.
 chapter i. of the joy king arthur and the queen had of the achievement of
 the sangreal; and how launcelot fell to his old love again.
 so after the quest of the sangreal was fulfilled, and all knights that
 were left alive were come again unto the table round, as the book of the
 sangreal maketh mention, then was there great joy in the court; and in
 especial king arthur and queen guenever made great joy of the remnant that
 were come home, and passing glad was the king and the queen of sir
 launcelot and of sir bors, for they had been passing long away in the
 quest of the sangreal.
 then, as the book saith, sir launcelot began to resort unto queen guenever
 again, and forgat the promise and the perfection that he made in the
 quest. for, as the book saith, had not sir launcelot been in his privy
 thoughts and in his mind so set inwardly to the queen as he was in seeming
 outward to god, there had no knight passed him in the quest of the
 sangreal; but ever his thoughts were privily on the queen, and so they
 loved together more hotter than they did to-forehand, and had such privy
 draughts together, that many in the court spake of it, and in especial sir
 agravaine, sir gawaine's brother, for he was ever open-mouthed.
 so befell that sir launcelot had many resorts of ladies and damosels that
 daily resorted unto him, that besought him to be their champion, and in
 all such matters of right sir launcelot applied him daily to do for the
 pleasure of our lord, jesu christ. and ever as much as he might he
 withdrew him from the company and fellowship of queen guenever, for to
 eschew the slander and noise; wherefore the queen waxed wroth with sir
 launcelot. and upon a day she called sir launcelot unto her chamber, and
 said thus: sir launcelot, i see and feel daily that thy love beginneth to
 slake, for thou hast no joy to be in my presence, but ever thou art out of
 this court, and quarrels and matters thou hast nowadays for ladies and
 gentlewomen more than ever thou wert wont to have aforehand.
 ah madam, said launcelot, in this ye must hold me excused for divers
 causes; one is, i was but late in the quest of the sangreal; and i thank
 god of his great mercy, and never of my desert, that i saw in that my
 quest as much as ever saw any sinful man, and so was it told me. and if i
 had not had my privy thoughts to return to your love again as i do, i had
 seen as great mysteries as ever saw my son galahad, outher percivale, or
 sir bors; and therefore, madam, i was but late in that quest. wit ye well,
 madam, it may not be yet lightly forgotten the high service in whom i did
 my diligent labour. also, madam, wit ye well that there be many men speak
 of our love in this court, and have you and me greatly in await, as sir
 agravaine and sir mordred; and madam, wit ye well i dread them more for
 your sake than for any fear i have of them myself, for i may happen to
 escape and rid myself in a great need, where ye must abide all that will
 be said unto you. and then if that ye fall in any distress through wilful
 folly, then is there none other remedy or help but by me and my blood. and
 wit ye well, madam, the boldness of you and me will bring us to great
 shame and slander; and that were me loath to see you dishonoured. and that
 is the cause i take upon me more for to do for damosels and maidens than
 ever i did to-fore, that men should understand my joy and my delight is my
 pleasure to have ado for damosels and maidens.
 chapter ii. how the queen commanded sir launcelot to avoid the court, and
 of the sorrow that launcelot made.
 all this while the queen stood still and let sir launcelot say what he
 would. and when he had all said she brast out a-weeping, and so she sobbed
 and wept a great while. and when she might speak she said: launcelot, now
 i well understand that thou art a false recreant knight and a common
 lecher, and lovest and holdest other ladies, and by me thou hast disdain
 and scorn. for wit thou well, she said, now i understand thy falsehood,
 and therefore shall i never love thee no more. and never be thou so hardy
 to come in my sight; and right here i discharge thee this court, that thou
 never come within it; and i forfend thee my fellowship, and upon pain of
 thy head that thou see me no more. right so sir launcelot departed with
 great heaviness, that unnethe he might sustain himself for great
 dole-making.
 then he called sir bors, sir ector de maris, and sir lionel, and told them
 how the queen had forfended him the court, and so he was in will to depart
 into his own country. fair sir, said sir bors de ganis, ye shall not
 depart out of this land by mine advice. ye must remember in what honour ye
 are renowned, and called the noblest knight of the world; and many great
 matters ye have in hand. and women in their hastiness will do ofttimes
 that sore repenteth them; and therefore by mine advice ye shall take your
 horse, and ride to the good hermitage here beside windsor, that sometime
 was a good knight, his name is sir brasias, and there shall ye abide till
 i send you word of better tidings. brother, said sir launcelot, wit ye
 well i am full loath to depart out of this realm, but the queen hath
 defended me so highly, that meseemeth she will never be my good lady as
 she hath been. say ye never so, said sir bors, for many times or this time
 she hath been wroth with you, and after it she was the first that repented
 it. ye say well, said launcelot, for now will i do by your counsel, and
 take mine horse and my harness, and ride to the hermit sir brasias, and
 there will i repose me until i hear some manner of tidings from you; but,
 fair brother, i pray you get me the love of my lady, queen guenever, an ye
 may sir, said sir bors, ye need not to move me of such matters, for well
 ye wot i will do what i may to please you.
 and then the noble knight, sir launcelot, departed with right heavy cheer
 suddenly, that none earthly creature wist of him, nor where he was become,
 but sir bors. so when sir launcelot was departed, the queen outward made
 no manner of sorrow in showing to none of his blood nor to none other. but
 wit ye well, inwardly, as the book saith, she took great thought, but she
 bare it out with a proud countenance as though she felt nothing nor
 danger.
 chapter iii. how at a dinner that the queen made there was a knight
 enpoisoned, which sir mador laid on the queen.
 and then the queen let make a privy dinner in london unto the knights of
 the round table. and all was for to show outward that she had as great joy
 in all other knights of the table round as she had in sir launcelot. all
 only at that dinner she had sir gawaine and his brethren, that is for to
 say sir agravaine, sir gaheris, sir gareth, and sir mordred. also there
 was sir bors de ganis, sir blamore de ganis, sir bleoberis de ganis, sir
 galihud, sir galihodin, sir ector de maris, sir lionel, sir palomides,
 safere his brother, sir la cote male taile, sir persant, sir ironside, sir
 brandiles, sir kay le seneschal, sir mador de la porte, sir patrise, a
 knight of ireland, aliduk, sir astamore, and sir pinel le savage, the
 which was cousin to sir lamorak de galis, the good knight that sir gawaine
 and his brethren slew by treason. and so these four-and-twenty knights
 should dine with the queen in a privy place by themself, and there was
 made a great feast of all manner of dainties.
 but sir gawaine had a custom that he used daily at dinner and at supper,
 that he loved well all manner of fruit, and in especial apples and pears.
 and therefore whosomever dined or feasted sir gawaine would commonly
 purvey for good fruit for him, and so did the queen for to please sir
 gawaine; she let purvey for him all manner of fruit, for sir gawaine was a
 passing hot knight of nature. and this pinel hated sir gawaine because of
 his kinsman sir lamorak de galis; and therefore for pure envy and hate sir
 pinel enpoisoned certain apples for to enpoison sir gawaine. and so this
 was well unto the end of the meat; and so it befell by misfortune a good
 knight named patrise, cousin unto sir mador de la porte, to take a
 poisoned apple. and when he had eaten it he swelled so till he brast, and
 there sir patrise fell down suddenly dead among them.
 then every knight leapt from the board ashamed, and araged for wrath, nigh
 out of their wits. for they wist not what to say; considering queen
 guenever made the feast and dinner, they all had suspicion unto her. my
 lady, the queen, said gawaine, wit ye well, madam, that this dinner was
 made for me, for all folks that know my condition understand that i love
 well fruit, and now i see well i had near been slain; therefore, madam, i
 dread me lest ye will be shamed. then the queen stood still and was sore
 abashed, that she nist not what to say. this shall not so be ended, said
 sir mador de la porte, for here have i lost a full noble knight of my
 blood; and therefore upon this shame and despite i will be revenged to the
 utterance. and there openly sir mador appealed the queen of the death of
 his cousin, sir patrise. then stood they all still, that none would speak
 a word against him, for they all had great suspicion unto the queen
 because she let make that dinner. and the queen was so abashed that she
 could none other ways do, but wept so heartily that she fell in a swoon.
 with this noise and cry came to them king arthur, and when he wist of that
 trouble he was a passing heavy man.
 chapter iv. how sir mador appeached the queen of treason, and there was no
 knight would fight for her at the first time.
 and ever sir mador stood still afore the king, and ever he appealed the
 queen of treason; for the custom was such that time that all manner of
 shameful death was called treason. fair lords, said king arthur, me
 repenteth of this trouble, but the case is so i may not have ado in this
 matter, for i must be a rightful judge; and that repenteth me that i may
 not do battle for my wife, for as i deem this deed came never by her. and
 therefore i suppose she shall not be all distained, but that some good
 knight shall put his body in jeopardy for my queen rather than she shall
 be brent in a wrong quarrel. and therefore, sir mador, be not so hasty,
 for it may happen she shall not be all friendless; and therefore desire
 thou thy day of battle, and she shall purvey her of some good knight that
 shall answer you, or else it were to me great shame, and to all my court.
 my gracious lord, said sir mador, ye must hold me excused, for though ye
 be our king in that degree, ye are but a knight as we are, and ye are
 sworn unto knighthood as well as we; and therefore i beseech you that ye
 be not displeased, for there is none of the four-and-twenty knights that
 were bidden to this dinner but all they have great suspicion unto the
 queen. what say ye all, my lords? said sir mador. then they answered by
 and by that they could not excuse the queen; for why she made the dinner,
 and either it must come by her or by her servants. alas, said the queen, i
 made this dinner for a good intent, and never for none evil, so almighty
 god me help in my right, as i was never purposed to do such evil deeds,
 and that i report me unto god.
 my lord, the king, said sir mador, i require you as ye be a righteous king
 give me a day that i may have justice. well, said the king, i give the day
 this day fifteen days that thou be ready armed on horseback in the meadow
 beside westminster. and if it so fall that there be any knight to
 encounter with you, there mayst thou do the best, and god speed the right.
 and if it so fall that there be no knight at that day, then must my queen
 be burnt, and there she shall be ready to have her judgment. i am
 answered, said sir mador. and every knight went where it liked them.
 so when the king and the queen were together the king asked the queen how
 this case befell. the queen answered: so god me help, i wot not how or in
 what manner. where is sir launcelot? said king arthur; an he were here he
 would not grudge to do battle for you. sir, said the queen, i wot not
 where he is, but his brother and his kinsmen deem that he be not within
 this realm. that me repenteth, said king arthur, for an he were here he
 would soon stint this strife. then i will counsel you, said the king, and
 unto sir bors: that ye will do battle for her for sir launcelot's sake,
 and upon my life he will not refuse you. for well i see, said the king,
 that none of these four-and-twenty knights that were with you at your
 dinner where sir patrise was slain, that will do battle for you, nor none
 of them will say well of you, and that shall be a great slander for you in
 this court. alas, said the queen, and i may not do withal, but now i miss
 sir launcelot, for an he were here he would put me soon to my heart's
 ease. what aileth you, said the king, ye cannot keep sir launcelot upon
 your side? for wit ye well, said the king, who that hath sir launcelot
 upon his part hath the most man of worship in the world upon his side. now
 go your way, said the king unto the queen, and require sir bors to do
 battle for you for sir launcelot's sake.
 chapter v. how the queen required sir bors to fight for her, and how he
 granted upon condition; and how he warned sir launcelot thereof.
 so the queen departed from the king, and sent for sir bors into her
 chamber. and when he was come she besought him of succour. madam, said he,
 what would ye that i did? for i may not with my worship have ado in this
 matter, because i was at the same dinner, for dread that any of those
 knights would have me in suspicion. also, madam, said sir bors, now miss
 ye sir launcelot, for he would not have failed you neither in right nor in
 wrong, as ye have well proved when ye have been in danger; and now ye have
 driven him out of this country, by whom ye and all we were daily
 worshipped by; therefore, madam, i marvel how ye dare for shame require me
 to do any thing for you, in so much ye have chased him out of your country
 by whom we were borne up and honoured. alas, fair knight, said the queen,
 i put me wholly in your grace, and all that is done amiss i will amend as
 ye will counsel me. and therewith she kneeled down upon both her knees,
 and besought sir bors to have mercy upon her: outher i shall have a
 shameful death, and thereto i never offended.
 right so came king arthur, and found the queen kneeling afore sir bors;
 then sir bors pulled her up, and said: madam, ye do me great dishonour.
 ah, gentle knight, said the king, have mercy upon my queen, courteous
 knight, for i am now in certain she is untruly defamed. and therefore,
 courteous knight, said the king, promise her to do battle for her, i
 require you for the love of sir launcelot. my lord, said sir bors, ye
 require me the greatest thing that any man may require me; and wit ye well
 if i grant to do battle for the queen i shall wrath many of my fellowship
 of the table round. but as for that, said bors, i will grant my lord that
 for my lord sir launcelot's sake, and for your sake i will at that day be
 the queen's champion unless that there come by adventure a better knight
 than i am to do battle for her. will ye promise me this, said the king, by
 your faith? yea sir, said sir bors, of that i will not fail you, nor her
 both, but if there come a better knight than i am, and then shall he have
 the battle. then was the king and the queen passing glad, and so departed,
 and thanked him heartily.
 so then sir bors departed secretly upon a day, and rode unto sir launcelot
 thereas he was with the hermit, sir brasias, and told him of all their
 adventure. ah jesu, said sir launcelot, this is come happily as i would
 have it, and therefore i pray you make you ready to do battle, but look
 that ye tarry till ye see me come, as long as ye may. for i am sure mador
 is an hot knight when he is enchafed, for the more ye suffer him the
 hastier will he be to battle. sir, said bors, let me deal with him, doubt
 ye not ye shall have all your will. then departed sir bors from him and
 came to the court again. then was it noised in all the court that sir bors
 should do battle for the queen; wherefore many knights were displeased
 with him, that he would take upon him to do battle in the queen's quarrel;
 for there were but few knights in all the court but they deemed the queen
 was in the wrong, and that she had done that treason.
 so sir bors answered thus to his fellows of the table round: wit ye well,
 my fair lords, it were shame to us all an we suffered to see the most
 noble queen of the world to be shamed openly, considering her lord and our
 lord is the man of most worship in the world, and most christened, and he
 hath ever worshipped us all in all places. many answered him again: as for
 our most noble king arthur, we love him and honour him as well as ye do,
 but as for queen guenever we love her not, because she is a destroyer of
 good knights. fair lords, said sir bors, meseemeth ye say not as ye should
 say, for never yet in my days knew i never nor heard say that ever she was
 a destroyer of any good knight. but at all times as far as ever i could
 know she was a maintainer of good knights; and ever she hath been large
 and free of her goods to all good knights, and the most bounteous lady of
 her gifts and her good grace, that ever i saw or heard speak of. and
 therefore it were shame, said sir bors, to us all to our most noble king's
 wife, an we suffered her to be shamefully slain. and wit ye well, said sir
 bors, i will not suffer it, for i dare say so much, the queen is not
 guilty of sir patrise's death, for she owed him never none ill will, nor
 none of the four-and-twenty knights that were at that dinner; for i dare
 say for good love she bade us to dinner, and not for no mal engine, and
 that i doubt not shall be proved hereafter, for howsomever the game goeth,
 there was treason among us. then some said to sir bors: we may well
 believe your words. and so some of them were well pleased, and some were
 not so.
 chapter vi. how at the day sir bors made him ready for to fight for the
 queen; and when he would fight how another discharged him.
 the day came on fast until the even that the battle should be. then the
 queen sent for sir bors and asked him how he was disposed. truly madam,
 said he, i am disposed in likewise as i promised you, that is for to say i
 shall not fail you, unless by adventure there come a better knight than i
 am to do battle for you, then, madam, am i discharged of my promise. will
 ye, said the queen, that i tell my lord arthur thus? do as it shall please
 you, madam. then the queen went unto the king and told him the answer of
 sir bors. have ye no doubt, said the king, of sir bors, for i call him now
 one of the best knights of the world, and the most profitablest man. and
 thus it passed on until the morn, and the king and the queen and all
 manner of knights that were there at that time drew them unto the meadow
 beside westminster where the battle should be. and so when the king was
 come with the queen and many knights of the round table, then the queen
 was put there in the constable's ward, and a great fire made about an iron
 stake, that an sir mador de la porte had the better, she should be burnt:
 such custom was used in those days, that neither for favour, neither for
 love nor affinity, there should be none other but righteous judgment, as
 well upon a king as upon a knight, and as well upon a queen as upon
 another poor lady.
 so in this meanwhile came in sir mador de la porte, and took his oath
 afore the king, that the queen did this treason until his cousin sir
 patrise, and unto his oath he would prove it with his body, hand for hand,
 who that would say the contrary. right so came in sir bors de ganis, and
 said: that as for queen guenever she is in the right, and that will i make
 good with my hands that she is not culpable of this treason that is put
 upon her. then make thee ready, said sir mador, and we shall prove whether
 thou be in the right or i. sir mador, said sir bors, wit thou well i know
 you for a good knight. not for then i shall not fear you so greatly, but i
 trust to god i shall be able to withstand your malice. but this much have
 i promised my lord arthur and my lady the queen, that i shall do battle
 for her in this case to the uttermost, unless that there come a better
 knight than i am and discharge me. is that all? said sir mador, either
 come thou off and do battle with me, or else say nay. take your horse,
 said sir bors, and as i suppose, ye shall not tarry long but ye shall be
 answered.
 then either departed to their tents and made them ready to horseback as
 they thought best. and anon sir mador came into the field with his shield
 on his shoulder and his spear in his hand; and so rode about the place
 crying unto arthur: bid your champion come forth an he dare. then was sir
 bors ashamed and took his horse and came to the lists' end. and then was
 he ware where came from a wood there fast by a knight all armed, upon a
 white horse, with a strange shield of strange arms; and he came riding all
 that he might run, and so he came to sir bors, and said thus: fair knight,
 i pray you be not displeased, for here must a better knight than ye are
 have this battle, therefore i pray you withdraw you. for wit ye well i
 have had this day a right great journey, and this battle ought to be mine,
 and so i promised you when i spake with you last, and with all my heart i
 thank you of your good will. then sir bors rode unto king arthur and told
 him how there was a knight come that would have the battle for to fight
 for the queen. what knight is he? said the king. i wot not, said sir bors,
 but such covenant he made with me to be here this day. now my lord, said
 sir bors, here am i discharged.
 chapter vii how sir launcelot fought against sir mador for the queen, and
 how he overcame sir mador, and discharged the queen.
 then the king called to that knight, and asked him if he would fight for
 the queen. then he answered to the king: therefore came i hither, and
 therefore, sir king, he said, tarry me no longer, for i may not tarry. for
 anon as i have finished this battle i must depart hence, for i have ado
 many matters elsewhere. for wit you well, said that knight, this is
 dishonour to you all knights of the round table, to see and know so noble
 a lady and so courteous a queen as queen guenever is, thus to be rebuked
 and shamed amongst you. then they all marvelled what knight that might be
 that so took the battle upon him. for there was not one that knew him, but
 if it were sir bors.
 then said sir mador de la porte unto the king: now let me wit with whom i
 shall have ado withal. and then they rode to the lists' end, and there
 they couched their spears, and ran together with all their might, and sir
 mador's spear brake all to pieces, but the other's spear held, and bare
 sir mador's horse and all backward to the earth a great fall. but mightily
 and suddenly he avoided his horse and put his shield afore him, and then
 drew his sword, and bade the other knight alight and do battle with him on
 foot. then that knight descended from his horse lightly like a valiant
 man, and put his shield afore him and drew his sword; and so they came
 eagerly unto battle, and either gave other many great strokes, tracing and
 traversing, racing and foining, and hurtling together with their swords as
 it were wild boars. thus were they fighting nigh an hour, for this sir
 mador was a strong knight, and mightily proved in many strong battles. but
 at the last this knight smote sir mador grovelling upon the earth, and the
 knight stepped near him to have pulled sir mador flatling upon the ground;
 and therewith suddenly sir mador arose, and in his rising he smote that
 knight through the thick of the thighs that the blood ran out fiercely.
 and when he felt himself so wounded, and saw his blood, he let him arise
 upon his feet. and then he gave him such a buffet upon the helm that he
 fell to the earth flatling, and therewith he strode to him to have pulled
 off his helm off his head. and then sir mador prayed that knight to save
 his life, and so he yielded him as overcome, and released the queen of his
 quarrel. i will not grant thee thy life, said that knight, only that thou
 freely release the queen for ever, and that no mention be made upon sir
 patrise's tomb that ever queen guenever consented to that treason. all
 this shall be done, said sir mador, i clearly discharge my quarrel for
 ever.
 then the knights parters of the lists took up sir mador, and led him to
 his tent, and the other knight went straight to the stair-foot where sat
 king arthur; and by that time was the queen come to the king, and either
 kissed other heartily. and when the king saw that knight, he stooped down
 to him, and thanked him, and in likewise did the queen; and the king
 prayed him to put off his helmet, and to repose him, and to take a sop of
 wine. and then he put off his helm to drink, and then every knight knew
 him that it was sir launcelot du lake. anon as the king wist that, he took
 the queen in his hand, and yode unto sir launcelot, and said: sir, grant
 mercy of your great travail that ye have had this day for me and for my
 queen. my lord, said sir launcelot, wit ye well i ought of right ever to
 be in your quarrel, and in my lady the queen's quarrel, to do battle; for
 ye are the man that gave me the high order of knighthood, and that day my
 lady, your queen, did me great worship, and else i had been shamed; for
 that same day ye made me knight, through my hastiness i lost my sword, and
 my lady, your queen, found it, and lapped it in her train, and gave me my
 sword when i had need thereto, and else had i been shamed among all
 knights; and therefore, my lord arthur, i promised her at that day ever to
 be her knight in right outher in wrong. grant mercy, said the king, for
 this journey; and wit ye well, said the king, i shall acquit your
 goodness.
 and ever the queen beheld sir launcelot, and wept so tenderly that she
 sank almost to the ground for sorrow that he had done to her so great
 goodness where she shewed him great unkindness. then the knights of his
 blood drew unto him, and there either of them made great joy of other. and
 so came all the knights of the table round that were there at that time,
 and welcomed him. and then sir mador was had to leech-craft, and sir
 launcelot was healed of his wound. and then there was made great joy and
 mirths in that court.
 chapter viii. how the truth was known by the maiden of the lake, and of
 divers other matters.
 and so it befell that the damosel of the lake, her name was nimue, the
 which wedded the good knight sir pelleas, and so she came to the court;
 for ever she did great goodness unto king arthur and to all his knights
 through her sorcery and enchantments. and so when she heard how the queen
 was an-angered for the death of sir patrise, then she told it openly that
 she was never guilty; and there she disclosed by whom it was done, and
 named him, sir pinel; and for what cause he did it, there it was openly
 disclosed; and so the queen was excused, and the knight pinel fled into
 his country. then was it openly known that sir pinel enpoisoned the apples
 at the feast to that intent to have destroyed sir gawaine, because sir
 gawaine and his brethren destroyed sir lamorak de galis, to the which sir
 pinel was cousin unto. then was sir patrise buried in the church of
 westminster in a tomb, and thereupon was written: here lieth sir patrise
 of ireland, slain by sir pinel le savage, that enpoisoned apples to have
 slain sir gawaine, and by misfortune sir patrise ate one of those apples,
 and then suddenly he brast. also there was written upon the tomb that
 queen guenever was appealed of treason of the death of sir patrise, by sir
 mador de la porte; and there was made mention how sir launcelot fought
 with him for queen guenever, and overcame him in plain battle. all this
 was written upon the tomb of sir patrise in excusing of the queen. and
 then sir mador sued daily and long, to have the queen's good grace; and so
 by the means of sir launcelot he caused him to stand in the queen's good
 grace, and all was forgiven
 thus it passed on till our lady day, assumption. within a fifteen days of
 that feast the king let cry a great jousts and a tournament that should be
 at that day at camelot, that is winchester; and the king let cry that he
 and the king of scots would joust against all that would come against
 them. and when this cry was made, thither came many knights. so there came
 thither the king of northgalis, and king anguish of ireland, and the king
 with the hundred knights, and galahad, the haut prince, and the king of
 northumberland, and many other noble dukes and earls of divers countries.
 so king arthur made him ready to depart to these jousts, and would have
 had the queen with him, but at that time she would not, she said, for she
 was sick and might not ride at that time. that me repenteth, said the
 king, for this seven year ye saw not such a noble fellowship together
 except at whitsuntide when galahad departed from the court. truly, said
 the queen to the king, ye must hold me excused, i may not be there, and
 that me repenteth. and many deemed the queen would not be there because of
 sir launcelot du lake, for sir launcelot would not ride with the king, for
 he said that he was not whole of the wound the which sir mador had given
 him; wherefore the king was heavy and passing wroth. and so he departed
 toward winchester with his fellowship; and so by the way the king lodged
 in a town called astolat, that is now in english called guildford, and
 there the king lay in the castle.
 so when the king was departed the queen called sir launcelot to her, and
 said thus: sir launcelot, ye are greatly to blame thus to hold you behind
 my lord; what, trow ye, what will your enemies and mine say and deem?
 nought else but, see how sir launcelot holdeth him ever behind the king,
 and so doth the queen, for that they would have their pleasure together.
 and thus will they say, said the queen to sir launcelot, have ye no doubt
 thereof.
 chapter ix. how sir launcelot rode to astolat, and received a sleeve to
 wear upon his helm at the request of a maid.
 madam, said sir launcelot, i allow your wit, it is of late come since ye
 were wise. and therefore, madam, at this time i will be ruled by your
 counsel, and this night i will take my rest, and to-morrow by time i will
 take my way toward winchester. but wit you well, said sir launcelot to the
 queen, that at that jousts i will be against the king, and against all his
 fellowship. ye may there do as ye list, said the queen, but by my counsel
 ye shall not be against your king and your fellowship. for therein be full
 many hard knights of your blood, as ye wot well enough, it needeth not to
 rehearse them. madam, said sir launcelot, i pray you that ye be not
 displeased with me, for i will take the adventure that god will send me.
 and so upon the morn early sir launcelot heard mass and brake his fast,
 and so took his leave of the queen and departed. and then he rode so much
 until he came to astolat, that is guildford; and there it happed him in
 the eventide he came to an old baron's place that hight sir bernard of
 astolat. and as sir launcelot entered into his lodging, king arthur espied
 him as he did walk in a garden beside the castle, how he took his lodging,
 and knew him full well. it is well, said king arthur unto the knights that
 were with him in that garden beside the castle, i have now espied one
 knight that will play his play at the jousts to the which we be gone
 toward; i undertake he will do marvels. who is that, we pray you tell us?
 said many knights that were there at that time. ye shall not wit for me,
 said the king, as at this time. and so the king smiled, and went to his
 lodging.
 so when sir launcelot was in his lodging, and unarmed him in his chamber,
 the old baron and hermit came to him making his reverence, and welcomed
 him in the best manner; but the old knight knew not sir launcelot. fair
 sir, said sir launcelot to his host, i would pray you to lend me a shield
 that were not openly known, for mine is well known. sir, said his host, ye
 shall have your desire, for meseemeth ye be one of the likeliest knights
 of the world, and therefore i shall shew you friendship. sir, wit you well
 i have two sons that were but late made knights, and the eldest hight sir
 tirre, and he was hurt that same day he was made knight, that he may not
 ride, and his shield ye shall have; for that is not known i dare say but
 here, and in no place else. and my youngest son hight lavaine, and if it
 please you, he shall ride with you unto that jousts; and he is of his age
 strong and wight, for much my heart giveth unto you that ye should be a
 noble knight, therefore i pray you, tell me your name, said sir bernard.
 as for that, said sir launcelot, ye must hold me excused as at this time,
 and if god give me grace to speed well at the jousts i shall come again
 and tell you. but i pray you, said sir launcelot, in any wise let me have
 your son, sir lavaine, with me, and that i may have his brother's shield.
 all this shall be done, said sir bernard.
 this old baron had a daughter that was called that time the fair maiden of
 astolat. and ever she beheld sir launcelot wonderfully; and as the book
 saith, she cast such a love unto sir launcelot that she could never
 withdraw her love, wherefore she died, and her name was elaine le blank.
 so thus as she came to and fro she was so hot in her love that she
 besought sir launcelot to wear upon him at the jousts a token of hers.
 fair damosel, said sir launcelot, an if i grant you that, ye may say i do
 more for your love than ever i did for lady or damosel. then he remembered
 him he would go to the jousts disguised. and because he had never fore
 that time borne no manner of token of no damosel, then he bethought him
 that he would bear one of her, that none of his blood thereby might know
 him, and then he said: fair maiden, i will grant you to wear a token of
 yours upon mine helmet, and therefore what it is, shew it me. sir, she
 said, it is a red sleeve of mine, of scarlet, well embroidered with great
 pearls: and so she brought it him. so sir launcelot received it, and said:
 never did i erst so much for no damosel. and then sir launcelot betook the
 fair maiden his shield in keeping, and prayed her to keep that until that
 he came again; and so that night he had merry rest and great cheer, for
 ever the damosel elaine was about sir launcelot all the while she might be
 suffered.
 chapter x. how the tourney began at winchester, and what knights were at
 the jousts; and other things.
 so upon a day, on the morn, king arthur and all his knights departed, for
 their king had tarried three days to abide his noble knights. and so when
 the king was ridden, sir launcelot and sir lavaine made them ready to
 ride, and either of them had white shields, and the red sleeve sir
 launcelot let carry with him. and so they took their leave at sir bernard,
 the old baron, and at his daughter, the fair maiden of astolat. and then
 they rode so long till that they came to camelot, that time called
 winchester; and there was great press of kings, dukes earls, and barons,
 and many noble knights. but there sir launcelot was lodged privily by the
 means of sir lavaine with a rich burgess, that no man in that town was
 ware what they were. and so they reposed them there till our lady day,
 assumption, as the great feast should be. so then trumpets blew unto the
 field, and king arthur was set on high upon a scaffold to behold who did
 best. but as the french book saith, the king would not suffer sir gawaine
 to go from him, for never had sir gawaine the better an sir launcelot were
 in the field; and many times was sir gawaine rebuked when launcelot came
 into any jousts disguised.
 then some of the kings, as king anguish of ireland and the king of scots,
 were that time turned upon the side of king arthur. and then on the other
 party was the king of northgalis, and the king with the hundred knights,
 and the king of northumberland, and sir galahad, the haut prince. but
 these three kings and this duke were passing weak to hold against king
 arthur's party, for with him were the noblest knights of the world. so
 then they withdrew them either party from other, and every man made him
 ready in his best manner to do what he might.
 then sir launcelot made him ready, and put the red sleeve upon his head,
 and fastened it fast; and so sir launcelot and sir lavaine departed out of
 winchester privily, and rode until a little leaved wood behind the party
 that held against king arthur's party, and there they held them still till
 the parties smote together. and then came in the king of scots and the
 king of ireland on arthur's party, and against them came the king of
 northumberland, and the king with the hundred knights smote down the king
 of northumberland, and the king with the hundred knights smote down king
 anguish of ireland. then sir palomides that was on arthur's party
 encountered with sir galahad, and either of them smote down other, and
 either party halp their lords on horseback again. so there began a strong
 assail upon both parties. and then came in sir brandiles, sir sagramore le
 desirous, sir dodinas le savage, sir kay le seneschal, sir griflet le fise
 de dieu, sir mordred, sir meliot de logris, sir ozanna le cure hardy, sir
 safere, sir epinogris, sir galleron of galway. all these fifteen knights
 were knights of the table round. so these with more other came in
 together, and beat aback the king of northumberland and the king of
 northgalis. when sir launcelot saw this, as he hoved in a little leaved
 wood, then he said unto sir lavaine: see yonder is a company of good
 knights, and they hold them together as boars that were chafed with dogs.
 that is truth, said sir lavaine.
 chapter xi. how sir launcelot and sir lavaine entered in the field against
 them of king arthur's court, and how launcelot was hurt.
 now, said sir launcelot, an ye will help me a little, ye shall see yonder
 fellowship that chaseth now these men in our side, that they shall go as
 fast backward as they went forward. sir, spare not, said sir lavaine, for
 i shall do what i may. then sir launcelot and sir lavaine came in at the
 thickest of the press, and there sir launcelot smote down sir brandiles,
 sir sagramore, sir dodinas, sir kay, sir griflet, and all this he did with
 one spear; and sir lavaine smote down sir lucan le butler and sir
 bedevere. and then sir launcelot gat another spear, and there he smote
 down sir agravaine, sir gaheris, and sir mordred, and sir meliot de
 logris; and sir lavaine smote ozanna le cure hardy. and then sir launcelot
 drew his sword, and there he smote on the right hand and on the left hand,
 and by great force he unhorsed sir safere, sir epinogris, and sir
 galleron; and then the knights of the table round withdrew them aback,
 after they had gotten their horses as well as they might. o mercy jesu,
 said sir gawaine, what knight is yonder that doth so marvellous deeds of
 arms in that field? i wot well what he is, said king arthur, but as at
 this time i will not name him. sir, said sir gawaine, i would say it were
 sir launcelot by his riding and his buffets that i see him deal, but ever
 meseemeth it should not be he, for that he beareth the red sleeve upon his
 head; for i wist him never bear token at no jousts, of lady nor
 gentlewoman. let him be, said king arthur, he will be better known, and do
 more, or ever he depart.
 then the party that was against king arthur were well comforted, and then
 they held them together that beforehand were sore rebuked. then sir bors,
 sir ector de maris, and sir lionel called unto them the knights of their
 blood, as sir blamore de ganis, sir bleoberis, sir aliduke, sir galihud,
 sir galihodin, sir bellangere le beuse. so these nine knights of sir
 launcelot's kin thrust in mightily, for they were all noble knights; and
 they, of great hate and despite that they had unto him, thought to rebuke
 that noble knight sir launcelot, and sir lavaine, for they knew them not;
 and so they came hurling together, and smote down many knights of
 northgalis and of northumberland. and when sir launcelot saw them fare so,
 he gat a spear in his hand; and there encountered with him all at once sir
 bors, sir ector, and sir lionel, and all they three smote him at once with
 their spears. and with force of themself they smote sir launcelot's horse
 to the earth; and by misfortune sir bors smote sir launcelot through the
 shield into the side, and the spear brake, and the head left still in his
 side.
 when sir lavaine saw his master lie on the ground, he ran to the king of
 scots and smote him to the earth; and by great force he took his horse,
 and brought him to sir launcelot, and maugre of them all he made him to
 mount upon that horse. and then launcelot gat a spear in his hand, and
 there he smote sir bors, horse and man, to the earth. in the same wise he
 served sir ector and sir lionel; and sir lavaine smote down sir blamore de
 ganis. and then sir launcelot drew his sword, for he felt himself so sore
 y-hurt that he weened there to have had his death. and then he smote sir
 bleoberis such a buffet on the helm that he fell down to the earth in a
 swoon. and in the same wise he served sir aliduke and sir galihud. and sir
 lavaine smote down sir bellangere, that was the son of alisander le
 orphelin.
 and by this was sir bors horsed, and then he came with sir ector and sir
 lionel, and all they three smote with swords upon sir launcelot's helmet.
 and when he felt their buffets and his wound, the which was so grievous,
 then he thought to do what he might while he might endure. and then he
 gave sir bors such a buffet that he made him bow his head passing low; and
 therewithal he raced off his helm, and might have slain him; and so pulled
 him down, and in the same wise he served sir ector and sir lionel. for as
 the book saith he might have slain them, but when he saw their visages his
 heart might not serve him thereto, but left them there. and then afterward
 he hurled into the thickest press of them all, and did there the
 marvelloust deeds of arms that ever man saw or heard speak of, and ever
 sir lavaine, the good knight, with him. and there sir launcelot with his
 sword smote down and pulled down, as the french book maketh mention, mo
 than thirty knights, and the most part were of the table round; and sir
 lavaine did full well that day, for he smote down ten knights of the table
 round.
 chapter xii. how sir launcelot and sir lavaine departed out of the field,
 and in what jeopardy launcelot was.
 mercy jesu, said sir gawaine to arthur, i marvel what knight that he is
 with the red sleeve. sir, said king arthur, he will be known or he depart.
 and then the king blew unto lodging, and the prize was given by heralds
 unto the knight with the white shield that bare the red sleeve. then came
 the king with the hundred knights, the king of northgalis, and the king of
 northumberland, and sir galahad, the haut prince, and said unto sir
 launcelot: fair knight, god thee bless, for much have ye done this day for
 us, therefore we pray you that ye will come with us that ye may receive
 the honour and the prize as ye have worshipfully deserved it. my fair
 lords, said sir launcelot, wit you well if i have deserved thanks i have
 sore bought it, and that me repenteth, for i am like never to escape with
 my life; therefore, fair lords, i pray you that ye will suffer me to
 depart where me liketh, for i am sore hurt. i take none force of none
 honour, for i had liefer to repose me than to be lord of all the world.
 and therewithal he groaned piteously, and rode a great wallop away-ward
 from them until he came under a wood's side.
 and when he saw that he was from the field nigh a mile, that he was sure
 he might not be seen, then he said with an high voice: o gentle knight,
 sir lavaine, help me that this truncheon were out of my side, for it
 sticketh so sore that it nigh slayeth me. o mine own lord, said sir
 lavaine, i would fain do that might please you, but i dread me sore an i
 pull out the truncheon that ye shall be in peril of death. i charge you,
 said sir launcelot, as ye love me, draw it out. and therewithal he
 descended from his horse, and right so did sir lavaine; and forthwithal
 sir lavaine drew the truncheon out of his side, and he gave a great shriek
 and a marvellous grisly groan, and the blood brast out nigh a pint at
 once, that at the last he sank down upon his buttocks, and so swooned pale
 and deadly. alas, said sir lavaine, what shall i do? and then he turned
 sir launcelot into the wind, but so he lay there nigh half an hour as he
 had been dead.
 and so at the last sir launcelot cast up his eyes, and said: o lavaine,
 help me that i were on my horse, for here is fast by within this two mile
 a gentle hermit that sometime was a full noble knight and a great lord of
 possessions. and for great goodness he hath taken him to wilful poverty,
 and forsaken many lands, and his name is sir baudwin of brittany, and he
 is a full noble surgeon and a good leech. now let see, help me up that i
 were there, for ever my heart giveth me that i shall never die of my
 cousin-germain's hands. and then with great pain sir lavaine halp him upon
 his horse. and then they rode a great wallop together, and ever sir
 launcelot bled that it ran down to the earth; and so by fortune they came
 to that hermitage the which was under a wood, and a great cliff on the
 other side, and a fair water running under it. and then sir lavaine beat
 on the gate with the butt of his spear, and cried fast: let in for jesu's
 sake.
 and there came a fair child to them, and asked them what they would. fair
 son, said sir lavaine, go and pray thy lord, the hermit, for god's sake to
 let in here a knight that is full sore wounded; and this day tell thy lord
 i saw him do more deeds of arms than ever i heard say that any man did. so
 the child went in lightly, and then he brought the hermit, the which was a
 passing good man. when sir lavaine saw him he prayed him for god's sake of
 succour. what knight is he? said the hermit. is he of the house of king
 arthur, or not? i wot not, said sir lavaine, what is he, nor what is his
 name, but well i wot i saw him do marvellously this day as of deeds of
 arms. on whose party was he? said the hermit. sir, said sir lavaine, he
 was this day against king arthur, and there he won the prize of all the
 knights of the round table. i have seen the day, said the hermit, i would
 have loved him the worse because he was against my lord, king arthur, for
 sometime i was one of the fellowship of the round table, but i thank god
 now i am otherwise disposed. but where is he? let me see him. then sir
 lavaine brought the hermit to him.
 chapter xiii. how launcelot was brought to an hermit for to be healed of
 his wound, and of other matters.
 and when the hermit beheld him, as he sat leaning upon his saddle-bow ever
 bleeding piteously, and ever the knight-hermit thought that he should know
 him, but he could not bring him to knowledge because he was so pale for
 bleeding. what knight are ye, said the hermit, and where were ye born? my
 fair lord, said sir launcelot, i am a stranger and a knight adventurous,
 that laboureth throughout many realms for to win worship. then the hermit
 advised him better, and saw by a wound on his cheek that he was sir
 launcelot. alas, said the hermit, mine own lord why lain you your name
 from me? forsooth i ought to know you of right, for ye are the most
 noblest knight of the world, for well i know you for sir launcelot. sir,
 said he, sith ye know me, help me an ye may, for god's sake, for i would
 be out of this pain at once, either to death or to life. have ye no doubt,
 said the hermit, ye shall live and fare right well. and so the hermit
 called to him two of his servants, and so he and his servants bare him
 into the hermitage, and lightly unarmed him, and laid him in his bed. and
 then anon the hermit staunched his blood, and made him to drink good wine,
 so that sir launcelot was well refreshed and knew himself; for in those
 days it was not the guise of hermits as is nowadays, for there were none
 hermits in those days but that they had been men of worship and of
 prowess; and those hermits held great household, and refreshed people that
 were in distress.
 now turn we unto king arthur, and leave we sir launcelot in the hermitage.
 so when the kings were come together on both parties, and the great feast
 should be holden, king arthur asked the king of northgalis and their
 fellowship, where was that knight that bare the red sleeve: bring him
 afore me that he may have his laud, and honour, and the prize, as it is
 right. then spake sir galahad, the haut prince, and the king with the
 hundred knights: we suppose that knight is mischieved, and that he is
 never like to see you nor none of us all, and that is the greatest pity
 that ever we wist of any knight. alas, said arthur, how may this be, is he
 so hurt? what is his name? said king arthur. truly, said they all, we know
 not his name, nor from whence he came, nor whither he would. alas, said
 the king, this be to me the worst tidings that came to me this seven year,
 for i would not for all the lands i wield to know and wit it were so that
 that noble knight were slain. know ye him? said they all. as for that,
 said arthur, whether i know him or know him not, ye shall not know for me
 what man he is, but almighty jesu send me good tidings of him. and so said
 they all. by my head, said sir gawaine, if it so be that the good knight
 be so sore hurt, it is great damage and pity to all this land, for he is
 one of the noblest knights that ever i saw in a field handle a spear or a
 sword; and if he may be found i shall find him, for i am sure he nis not
 far from this town. bear you well, said king arthur, an ye may find him,
 unless that he be in such a plight that he may not wield himself. jesu
 defend, said sir gawaine, but wit i shall what he is, an i may find him.
 right so sir gawaine took a squire with him upon hackneys, and rode all
 about camelot within six or seven mile, but so he came again and could
 hear no word of him. then within two days king arthur and all the
 fellowship returned unto london again. and so as they rode by the way it
 happed sir gawaine at astolat to lodge with sir bernard thereas was sir
 launcelot lodged. and so as sir gawaine was in his chamber to repose him
 sir bernard, the old baron, came unto him, and his daughter elaine, to
 cheer him and to ask him what tidings, and who did best at that tournament
 of winchester. so god me help, said sir gawaine, there were two knights
 that bare two white shields, but the one of them bare a red sleeve upon
 his head, and certainly he was one of the best knights that ever i saw
 joust in field. for i dare say, said sir gawaine, that one knight with the
 red sleeve smote down forty knights of the table round, and his fellow did
 right well and worshipfully. now blessed be god, said the fair maiden of
 astolat, that that knight sped so well, for he is the man in the world
 that i first loved, and truly he shall be last that ever i shall love.
 now, fair maid, said sir gawaine, is that good knight your love? certainly
 sir, said she, wit ye well he is my love. then know ye his name? said sir
 gawaine. nay truly, said the damosel, i know not his name nor from whence
 he cometh, but to say that i love him, i promise you and god that i love
 him. how had ye knowledge of him first? said sir gawaine.
 chapter xiv. how sir gawaine was lodged with the lord of astolat, and
 there had knowledge that it was sir launcelot that bare the red sleeve.
 then she told him as ye have heard to-fore, and how her father betook him
 her brother to do him service, and how her father lent him her brother's,
 sir tirre's, shield: and here with me he left his own shield. for what
 cause did he so? said sir gawaine. for this cause, said the damosel, for
 his shield was too well known among many noble knights. ah fair damosel,
 said sir gawaine, please it you let me have a sight of that shield. sir,
 said she, it is in my chamber, covered with a case, and if ye will come
 with me ye shall see it. not so, said sir bernard till his daughter, let
 send for it.
 so when the shield was come, sir gawaine took off the case, and when he
 beheld that shield he knew anon that it was sir launcelot's shield, and
 his own arms. ah jesu mercy, said sir gawaine, now is my heart more
 heavier than ever it was to-fore. why? said elaine. for i have great
 cause, said sir gawaine. is that knight that oweth this shield your love?
 yea truly, said she, my love he is, god would i were his love. so god me
 speed, said sir gawaine, fair damosel ye have right, for an he be your
 love ye love the most honourable knight of the world, and the man of most
 worship. so me thought ever, said the damosel, for never or that time, for
 no knight that ever i saw, loved i never none erst. god grant, said sir
 gawaine, that either of you may rejoice other, but that is in a great
 adventure. but truly, said sir gawaine unto the damosel, ye may say ye
 have a fair grace, for why i have known that noble knight this
 four-and-twenty year, and never or that day, i nor none other knight, i
 dare make good, saw nor heard say that ever he bare token or sign of no
 lady, gentlewoman, ne maiden, at no jousts nor tournament. and therefore
 fair maiden, said sir gawaine, ye are much beholden to him to give him
 thanks. but i dread me, said sir gawaine, that ye shall never see him in
 this world, and that is great pity that ever was of earthly knight. alas,
 said she, how may this be, is he slain? i say not so, said sir gawaine,
 but wit ye well he is grievously wounded, by all manner of signs, and by
 men's sight more likelier to be dead than to be alive; and wit ye well he
 is the noble knight, sir launcelot, for by this shield i know him. alas,
 said the fair maiden of astolat, how may this be, and what was his hurt?
 truly, said sir gawaine, the man in the world that loved him best hurt him
 so; and i dare say, said sir gawaine, an that knight that hurt him knew
 the very certainty that he had hurt sir launcelot, it would be the most
 sorrow that ever came to his heart.
 now fair father, said then elaine, i require you give me leave to ride and
 to seek him, or else i wot well i shall go out of my mind, for i shall
 never stint till that i find him and my brother, sir lavaine. do as it
 liketh you, said her father, for me sore repenteth of the hurt of that
 noble knight. right so the maid made her ready, and before sir gawaine,
 making great dole.
 then on the morn sir gawaine came to king arthur, and told him how he had
 found sir launcelot's shield in the keeping of the fair maiden of astolat.
 all that knew i aforehand, said king arthur, and that caused me i would
 not suffer you to have ado at the great jousts, for i espied, said king
 arthur, when he came in till his lodging full late in the evening in
 astolat. but marvel have i, said arthur, that ever he would bear any sign
 of any damosel, for or now i never heard say nor knew that ever he bare
 any token of none earthly woman. by my head, said sir gawaine, the fair
 maiden of astolat loveth him marvellously well; what it meaneth i cannot
 say, and she is ridden after to seek him. so the king and all came to
 london, and there sir gawaine openly disclosed to all the court that it
 was sir launcelot that jousted best.
 chapter xv. of the sorrow that sir bors had for the hurt of launcelot; and
 of the anger that the queen had because launcelot bare the sleeve.
 and when sir bors heard that, wit ye well he was an heavy man, and so were
 all his kinsmen. but when queen guenever wist that sir launcelot bare the
 red sleeve of the fair maiden of astolat she was nigh out of her mind for
 wrath. and then she sent for sir bors de ganis in all the haste that might
 be. so when sir bors was come to-fore the queen, then she said: ah sir
 bors, have ye heard say how falsely sir launcelot hath betrayed me? alas
 madam, said sir bors, i am afeard he hath betrayed himself and us all. no
 force, said the queen, though he be destroyed, for he is a false
 traitor-knight. madam, said sir bors, i pray you say ye not so, for wit
 you well i may not hear such language of him. why sir bors, said she,
 should i not call him traitor when he bare the red sleeve upon his head at
 winchester, at the great jousts? madam, said sir bors, that sleeve-bearing
 repenteth me sore, but i dare say he did it to none evil intent, but for
 this cause he bare the red sleeve that none of his blood should know him.
 for or then we, nor none of us all, never knew that ever he bare token or
 sign of maid, lady, ne gentlewoman. fie on him, said the queen, yet for
 all his pride and bobaunce there ye proved yourself his better. nay madam,
 say ye never more so, for he beat me and my fellows, and might have slain
 us an he had would. fie on him, said the queen, for i heard sir gawaine
 say before my lord arthur that it were marvel to tell the great love that
 is between the fair maiden of astolat and him. madam, said sir bors, i may
 not warn sir gawaine to say what it pleased him; but i dare say, as for my
 lord, sir launcelot, that he loveth no lady, gentlewoman, nor maid, but
 all he loveth in like much. and therefore madam, said sir bors, ye may say
 what ye will, but wit ye well i will haste me to seek him, and find him
 wheresomever he be, and god send me good tidings of him. and so leave we
 them there, and speak we of sir launcelot that lay in great peril.
 so as fair elaine came to winchester she sought there all about, and by
 fortune sir lavaine was ridden to play him, to enchafe his horse. and anon
 as elaine saw him she knew him, and then she cried aloud until him. and
 when he heard her anon he came to her, and then she asked her brother how
 did my lord, sir launcelot. who told you, sister, that my lord's name was
 sir launcelot? then she told him how sir gawaine by his shield knew him.
 so they rode together till that they came to the hermitage, and anon she
 alighted.
 so sir lavaine brought her in to sir launcelot; and when she saw him lie
 so sick and pale in his bed she might not speak, but suddenly she fell to
 the earth down suddenly in a swoon, and there she lay a great while. and
 when she was relieved, she shrieked and said: my lord, sir launcelot, alas
 why be ye in this plight? and then she swooned again. and then sir
 launcelot prayed sir lavaine to take her up: and bring her to me. and when
 she came to herself sir launcelot kissed her, and said: fair maiden, why
 fare ye thus? ye put me to pain; wherefore make ye no more such cheer, for
 an ye be come to comfort me ye be right welcome; and of this little hurt
 that i have i shall be right hastily whole by the grace of god. but i
 marvel, said sir launcelot, who told you my name? then the fair maiden
 told him all how sir gawaine was lodged with her father: and there by your
 shield he discovered your name. alas, said sir launcelot, that me
 repenteth that my name is known, for i am sure it will turn unto anger.
 and then sir launcelot compassed in his mind that sir gawaine would tell
 queen guenever how he bare the red sleeve, and for whom; that he wist well
 would turn into great anger.
 so this maiden elaine never went from sir launcelot, but watched him day
 and night, and did such attendance to him, that the french book saith
 there was never woman did more kindlier for man than she. then sir
 launcelot prayed sir lavaine to make aspies in winchester for sir bors if
 he came there, and told him by what tokens he should know him, by a wound
 in his forehead. for well i am sure, said sir launcelot, that sir bors
 will seek me, for he is the same good knight that hurt me.
 chapter xvi. how sir bors sought launcelot and found him in the hermitage,
 and of the lamentation between them.
 now turn we unto sir bors de ganis that came unto winchester to seek after
 his cousin sir launcelot. and so when he came to winchester, anon there
 were men that sir lavaine had made to lie in a watch for such a man, and
 anon sir lavaine had warning; and then sir lavaine came to winchester and
 found sir bors, and there he told him what he was, and with whom he was,
 and what was his name. now fair knight, said sir bors, i require you that
 ye will bring me to my lord, sir launcelot. sir, said sir lavaine, take
 your horse, and within this hour ye shall see him. and so they departed,
 and came to the hermitage.
 and when sir bors saw sir launcelot lie in his bed pale and discoloured,
 anon sir bors lost his countenance, and for kindness and pity he might not
 speak, but wept tenderly a great while. and then when he might speak he
 said thus: o my lord, sir launcelot, god you bless, and send you hasty
 recover; and full heavy am i of my misfortune and of mine unhappiness, for
 now i may call myself unhappy. and i dread me that god is greatly
 displeased with me, that he would suffer me to have such a shame for to
 hurt you that are all our leader, and all our worship; and therefore i
 call myself unhappy. alas that ever such a caitiff-knight as i am should
 have power by unhappiness to hurt the most noblest knight of the world.
 where i so shamefully set upon you and overcharged you, and where ye might
 have slain me, ye saved me; and so did not i, for i and your blood did to
 you our utterance. i marvel, said sir bors, that my heart or my blood
 would serve me, wherefore my lord, sir launcelot, i ask your mercy. fair
 cousin, said sir launcelot, ye be right welcome; and wit ye well, overmuch
 ye say for to please me, the which pleaseth me not, for why i have the
 same i sought; for i would with pride have overcome you all, and there in
 my pride i was near slain, and that was in mine own default, for i might
 have given you warning of my being there. and then had i had no hurt, for
 it is an old said saw, there is hard battle thereas kin and friends do
 battle either against other, there may be no mercy but mortal war.
 therefore, fair cousin, said sir launcelot, let this speech overpass, and
 all shall be welcome that god sendeth; and let us leave off this matter
 and let us speak of some rejoicing, for this that is done may not be
 undone; and let us find a remedy how soon that i may be whole.
 then sir bors leaned upon his bedside, and told sir launcelot how the
 queen was passing wroth with him, because he wore the red sleeve at the
 great jousts; and there sir bors told him all how sir gawaine discovered
 it: by your shield that ye left with the fair maiden of astolat. then is
 the queen wroth, said sir launcelot and therefore am i right heavy, for i
 deserved no wrath, for all that i did was because i would not be known.
 right so excused i you, said sir bors, but all was in vain, for she said
 more largelier to me than i to you now. but is this she, said sir bors,
 that is so busy about you, that men call the fair maiden of astolat? she
 it is, said sir launcelot, that by no means i cannot put her from me. why
 should ye put her from you? said sir bors, she is a passing fair damosel,
 and a well beseen, and well taught; and god would, fair cousin, said sir
 bors, that ye could love her, but as to that i may not, nor i dare not,
 counsel you. but i see well, said sir bors, by her diligence about you
 that she loveth you entirely. that me repenteth, said sir launcelot. sir,
 said sir bors, she is not the first that hath lost her pain upon you, and
 that is the more pity: and so they talked of many more things. and so
 within three days or four sir launcelot was big and strong again.
 chapter xvii. how sir launcelot armed him to assay if he might bear arms,
 and how his wounds brast out again.
 then sir bors told sir launcelot how there was sworn a great tournament
 and jousts betwixt king arthur and the king of northgalis, that should be
 upon all hallowmass day, beside winchester. is that truth? said sir
 launcelot; then shall ye abide with me still a little while until that i
 be whole, for i feel myself right big and strong. blessed be god, said sir
 bors. then were they there nigh a month together, and ever this maiden
 elaine did ever her diligent labour night and day unto sir launcelot, that
 there was never child nor wife more meeker to her father and husband than
 was that fair maiden of astolat; wherefore sir bors was greatly pleased
 with her.
 so upon a day, by the assent of sir launcelot, sir bors, and sir lavaine,
 they made the hermit to seek in woods for divers herbs, and so sir
 launcelot made fair elaine to gather herbs for him to make him a bain. in
 the meanwhile sir launcelot made him to arm him at all pieces; and there
 he thought to assay his armour and his spear, for his hurt or not. and so
 when he was upon his horse he stirred him fiercely, and the horse was
 passing lusty and fresh because he was not laboured a month afore. and
 then sir launcelot couched that spear in the rest. that courser leapt
 mightily when he felt the spurs; and he that was upon him, the which was
 the noblest horse of the world, strained him mightily and stably, and kept
 still the spear in the rest; and therewith sir launcelot strained himself
 so straitly, with so great force, to get the horse forward, that the
 button of his wound brast both within and without; and therewithal the
 blood came out so fiercely that he felt himself so feeble that he might
 not sit upon his horse. and then sir launcelot cried unto sir bors: ah,
 sir bors and sir lavaine, help, for i am come to mine end. and therewith
 he fell down on the one side to the earth like a dead corpse. and then sir
 bors and sir lavaine came to him with sorrow-making out of measure. and so
 by fortune the maiden elaine heard their mourning, and then she came
 thither; and when she found sir launcelot there armed in that place she
 cried and wept as she had been wood; and then she kissed him, and did what
 she might to awake him. and then she rebuked her brother and sir bors, and
 called them false traitors, why they would take him out of his bed; there
 she cried, and said she would appeal them of his death.
 with this came the holy hermit, sir baudwin of brittany, and when he found
 sir launcelot in that plight he said but little, but wit ye well he was
 wroth; and then he bade them: let us have him in. and so they all bare him
 unto the hermitage, and unarmed him, and laid him in his bed; and evermore
 his wound bled piteously, but he stirred no limb of him. then the
 knight-hermit put a thing in his nose and a little deal of water in his
 mouth. and then sir launcelot waked of his swoon, and then the hermit
 staunched his bleeding. and when he might speak he asked sir launcelot why
 he put his life in jeopardy. sir, said sir launcelot, because i weened i
 had been strong, and also sir bors told me that there should be at all
 hallowmass a great jousts betwixt king arthur and the king of northgalis,
 and therefore i thought to assay it myself whether i might be there or
 not. ah, sir launcelot, said the hermit, your heart and your courage will
 never be done until your last day, but ye shall do now by my counsel let
 sir bors depart from you, and let him do at that tournament what he may:
 and by the grace of god, said the knight-hermit, by that the tournament be
 done and ye come hither again, sir launcelot shall be as whole as ye, so
 that he will be governed by me.
 chapter xviii. how sir bors returned and told tidings of sir launcelot;
 and of the tourney, and to whom the prize was given.
 then sir bors made him ready to depart from sir launcelot; and then sir
 launcelot said: fair cousin, sir bors, recommend me unto all them unto
 whom me ought to recommend me unto. and i pray you, enforce yourself at
 that jousts that ye may be best, for my love; and here shall i abide you
 at the mercy of god till ye come again. and so sir bors departed and came
 to the court of king arthur, and told them in what place he had left sir
 launcelot. that me repenteth, said the king, but since he shall have his
 life we all may thank god. and there sir bors told the queen in what
 jeopardy sir launcelot was when he would assay his horse. and all that he
 did, madam, was for the love of you, because he would have been at this
 tournament. fie on him, recreant knight, said the queen, for wit ye well i
 am right sorry an he shall have his life. his life shall he have, said sir
 bors, and who that would otherwise, except you, madam, we that be of his
 blood should help to short their lives. but madam, said sir bors, ye have
 been oft-times displeased with my lord, sir launcelot, but at all times at
 the end ye find him a true knight: and so he departed.
 and then every knight of the round table that were there at that time
 present made them ready to be at that jousts at all hallowmass, and
 thither drew many knights of divers countries. and as all hallowmass drew
 near, thither came the king of northgalis, and the king with the hundred
 knights, and sir galahad, the haut prince, of surluse, and thither came
 king anguish of ireland, and the king of scots. so these three kings came
 on king arthur's party. and so that day sir gawaine did great deeds of
 arms, and began first. and the heralds numbered that sir gawaine smote
 down twenty knights. then sir bors de ganis came in the same time, and he
 was numbered that he smote down twenty knights; and therefore the prize
 was given betwixt them both, for they began first and longest endured.
 also sir gareth, as the book saith, did that day great deeds of arms, for
 he smote down and pulled down thirty knights. but when he had done these
 deeds he tarried not but so departed, and therefore he lost his prize. and
 sir palomides did great deeds of arms that day, for he smote down twenty
 knights, but he departed suddenly, and men deemed sir gareth and he rode
 together to some manner adventures.
 so when this tournament was done sir bors departed and rode till he came
 to sir launcelot, his cousin; and then he found him walking on his feet,
 and there either made great joy of other; and so sir bors told sir
 launcelot of all the jousts like as ye have heard. i marvel, said sir
 launcelot, that sir gareth, when he had done such deeds of arms, that he
 would not tarry. thereof we marvelled all, said sir bors, for but if it
 were you, or sir tristram, or sir lamorak de galis, i saw never knight
 bear down so many in so little a while as did sir gareth: and anon he was
 gone we wist not where. by my head, said sir launcelot, he is a noble
 knight, and a mighty man and well breathed; and if he were well assayed,
 said sir launcelot i would deem he were good enough for any knight that
 beareth the life; and he is a gentle knight, courteous, true, and
 bounteous, meek, and mild, and in him is no manner of mal engin, but
 plain, faithful, and true.
 so then they made them ready to depart from the hermit. and so upon a morn
 they took their horses and elaine le blank with them; and when they came
 to astolat there were they well lodged, and had great cheer of sir
 bernard, the old baron, and of sir tirre, his son. and so upon the morn
 when sir launcelot should depart, fair elaine brought her father with her,
 and sir lavaine, and sir tirre, and thus she said:
 chapter xix. of the great lamentation of the fair maid of astolat when
 launcelot should depart, and how she died for his love.
 my lord, sir launcelot, now i see ye will depart; now fair knight and
 courteous knight, have mercy upon me, and suffer me not to die for thy
 love. what would ye that i did? said sir launcelot. i would have you to my
 husband, said elaine. fair damosel, i thank you, said sir launcelot, but
 truly, said he, i cast me never to be wedded man. then, fair knight, said
 she, will ye be my paramour? jesu defend me, said sir launcelot, for then
 i rewarded your father and your brother full evil for their great
 goodness. alas, said she, then must i die for your love. ye shall not so,
 said sir launcelot, for wit ye well, fair maiden, i might have been
 married an i had would, but i never applied me to be married yet; but
 because, fair damosel, that ye love me as ye say ye do, i will for your
 good will and kindness show you some goodness, and that is this, that
 wheresomever ye will beset your heart upon some good knight that will wed
 you, i shall give you together a thousand pound yearly to you and to your
 heirs; thus much will i give you, fair madam, for your kindness, and
 always while i live to be your own knight. of all this, said the maiden, i
 will none, for but if ye will wed me, or else be my paramour at the least,
 wit you well, sir launcelot, my good days are done. fair damosel, said sir
 launcelot, of these two things ye must pardon me.
 then she shrieked shrilly, and fell down in a swoon; and then women bare
 her into her chamber, and there she made over much sorrow; and then sir
 launcelot would depart, and there he asked sir lavaine what he would do.
 what should i do, said sir lavaine, but follow you, but if ye drive me
 from you, or command me to go from you. then came sir bernard to sir
 launcelot and said to him: i cannot see but that my daughter elaine will
 die for your sake. i may not do withal, said sir launcelot, for that me
 sore repenteth, for i report me to yourself, that my proffer is fair; and
 me repenteth, said sir launcelot, that she loveth me as she doth; i was
 never the causer of it, for i report me to your son i early ne late
 proffered her bounté nor fair behests; and as for me, said sir launcelot,
 i dare do all that a knight should do that she is a clean maiden for me,
 both for deed and for will. and i am right heavy of her distress, for she
 is a full fair maiden, good and gentle, and well taught. father, said sir
 lavaine, i dare make good she is a clean maiden as for my lord sir
 launcelot; but she doth as i do, for sithen i first saw my lord sir
 launcelot, i could never depart from him, nor nought i will an i may
 follow him.
 then sir launcelot took his leave, and so they departed, and came unto
 winchester. and when arthur wist that sir launcelot was come whole and
 sound the king made great joy of him, and so did sir gawaine and all the
 knights of the round table except sir agravaine and sir mordred. also
 queen guenever was wood wroth with sir launcelot, and would by no means
 speak with him, but estranged herself from him; and sir launcelot made all
 the means that he might for to speak with the queen, but it would not be.
 now speak we of the fair maiden of astolat that made such sorrow day and
 night that she never slept, ate, nor drank, and ever she made her
 complaint unto sir launcelot. so when she had thus endured a ten days,
 that she feebled so that she must needs pass out of this world, then she
 shrived her clean, and received her creator. and ever she complained still
 upon sir launcelot. then her ghostly father bade her leave such thoughts.
 then she said, why should i leave such thoughts? am i not an earthly
 woman? and all the while the breath is in my body i may complain me, for
 my belief is i do none offence though i love an earthly man; and i take
 god to my record i loved never none but sir launcelot du lake, nor never
 shall, and a clean maiden i am for him and for all other; and sithen it is
 the sufferance of god that i shall die for the love of so noble a knight,
 i beseech the high father of heaven to have mercy upon my soul, and upon
 mine innumerable pains that i suffered may be allegeance of part of my
 sins. for sweet lord jesu, said the fair maiden, i take thee to record, on
 thee i was never great offencer against thy laws; but that i loved this
 noble knight, sir launcelot, out of measure, and of myself, good lord, i
 might not withstand the fervent love wherefore i have my death.
 and then she called her father, sir bernard, and her brother, sir tirre,
 and heartily she prayed her father that her brother might write a letter
 like as she did indite it: and so her father granted her. and when the
 letter was written word by word like as she devised, then she prayed her
 father that she might be watched until she were dead. and while my body is
 hot let this letter be put in my right hand, and my hand bound fast with
 the letter until that i be cold; and let me be put in a fair bed with all
 the richest clothes that i have about me, and so let my bed and all my
 richest clothes be laid with me in a chariot unto the next place where
 thames is; and there let me be put within a barget, and but one man with
 me, such as ye trust to steer me thither, and that my barget be covered
 with black samite over and over: thus father i beseech you let it be done.
 so her father granted it her faithfully, all things should be done like as
 she had devised. then her father and her brother made great dole, for when
 this was done anon she died. and so when she was dead the corpse and the
 bed all was led the next way unto thames, and there a man, and the corpse,
 and all, were put into thames; and so the man steered the barget unto
 westminster, and there he rowed a great while to and fro or any espied it.
 chapter xx. how the corpse of the maid of astolat arrived to-fore king
 arthur, and of the burying, and how sir launcelot offered the mass-penny.
 so by fortune king arthur and the queen guenever were speaking together at
 a window, and so as they looked into thames they espied this black barget,
 and had marvel what it meant. then the king called sir kay, and showed it
 him. sir, said sir kay, wit you well there is some new tidings. go
 thither, said the king to sir kay, and take with you sir brandiles and
 agravaine, and bring me ready word what is there. then these four knights
 departed and came to the barget and went in; and there they found the
 fairest corpse lying in a rich bed, and a poor man sitting in the barget's
 end, and no word would he speak. so these four knights returned unto the
 king again, and told him what they found. that fair corpse will i see,
 said the king. and so then the king took the queen by the hand, and went
 thither.
 then the king made the barget to be holden fast, and then the king and the
 queen entered with certain knights with them; and there he saw the fairest
 woman lie in a rich bed, covered unto her middle with many rich clothes,
 and all was of cloth of gold, and she lay as though she had smiled. then
 the queen espied a letter in her right hand, and told it to the king. then
 the king took it and said: now am i sure this letter will tell what she
 was, and why she is come hither. so then the king and the queen went out
 of the barget, and so commanded a certain man to wait upon the barget.
 and so when the king was come within his chamber, he called many knights
 about him, and said that he would wit openly what was written within that
 letter. then the king brake it, and made a clerk to read it, and this was
 the intent of the letter. most noble knight, sir launcelot, now hath death
 made us two at debate for your love. i was your lover, that men called the
 fair maiden of astolat; therefore unto all ladies i make my moan, yet pray
 for my soul and bury me at least, and offer ye my mass-penny: this is my
 last request. and a clean maiden i died, i take god to witness: pray for
 my soul, sir launcelot, as thou art peerless. this was all the substance
 in the letter. and when it was read, the king, the queen, and all the
 knights wept for pity of the doleful complaints. then was sir launcelot
 sent for; and when he was come king arthur made the letter to be read to
 him.
 and when sir launcelot heard it word by word, he said: my lord arthur, wit
 ye well i am right heavy of the death of this fair damosel: god knoweth i
 was never causer of her death by my willing, and that will i report me to
 her own brother: here he is, sir lavaine. i will not say nay, said sir
 launcelot, but that she was both fair and good, and much i was beholden
 unto her, but she loved me out of measure. ye might have shewed her, said
 the queen, some bounty and gentleness that might have preserved her life.
 madam, said sir launcelot, she would none other ways be answered but that
 she would be my wife, outher else my paramour; and of these two i would
 not grant her, but i proffered her, for her good love that she shewed me,
 a thousand pound yearly to her, and to her heirs, and to wed any manner
 knight that she could find best to love in her heart. for madam, said sir
 launcelot, i love not to be constrained to love; for love must arise of
 the heart, and not by no constraint. that is truth, said the king, and
 many knight's love is free in himself, and never will be bounden, for
 where he is bounden he looseth himself.
 then said the king unto sir launcelot: it will be your worship that ye
 oversee that she be interred worshipfully. sir, said sir launcelot, that
 shall be done as i can best devise. and so many knights yede thither to
 behold that fair maiden. and so upon the morn she was interred richly, and
 sir launcelot offered her mass-penny; and all the knights of the table
 round that were there at that time offered with sir launcelot. and then
 the poor man went again with the barget. then the queen sent for sir
 launcelot, and prayed him of mercy, for why that she had been wroth with
 him causeless. this is not the first time, said sir launcelot, that ye had
 been displeased with me causeless, but, madam, ever i must suffer you, but
 what sorrow i endure i take no force. so this passed on all that winter,
 with all manner of hunting and hawking, and jousts and tourneys were many
 betwixt many great lords, and ever in all places sir lavaine gat great
 worship, so that he was nobly renowned among many knights of the table
 round.
 chapter xxi. of great jousts done all a christmas, and of a great jousts
 and tourney ordained by king arthur, and of sir launcelot.
 thus it passed on till christmas, and then every day there was jousts made
 for a diamond, who that jousted best should have a diamond. but sir
 launcelot would not joust but if it were at a great jousts cried. but sir
 lavaine jousted there all that christmas passingly well, and best was
 praised, for there were but few that did so well. wherefore all manner of
 knights deemed that sir lavaine should be made knight of the table round
 at the next feast of pentecost. so at-after christmas king arthur let call
 unto him many knights, and there they advised together to make a party and
 a great tournament and jousts. and the king of northgalis said to arthur,
 he would have on his party king anguish of ireland, and the king with the
 hundred knights, and the king of northumberland, and sir galahad, the haut
 prince. and so these four kings and this mighty duke took part against
 king arthur and the knights of the table round. and the cry was made that
 the day of the jousts should be beside westminster upon candlemas day,
 whereof many knights were glad, and made them ready to be at that jousts
 in the freshest manner.
 then queen guenever sent for sir launcelot, and said thus: i warn you that
 ye ride no more in no jousts nor tournaments but that your kinsmen may
 know you. and at these jousts that shall be ye shall have of me a sleeve
 of gold; and i pray you for my sake enforce yourself there, that men may
 speak of you worship; but i charge you as ye will have my love, that ye
 warn your kinsmen that ye will bear that day the sleeve of gold upon your
 helmet. madam, said sir launcelot, it shall be done. and so either made
 great joy of other. and when sir launcelot saw his time he told sir bors
 that he would depart, and have no more with him but sir lavaine, unto the
 good hermit that dwelt in that forest of windsor; his name was sir
 brasias; and there he thought to repose him, and take all the rest that he
 might, because he would be fresh at that day of jousts.
 so sir launcelot and sir lavaine departed, that no creature wist where he
 was become, but the noble men of his blood. and when he was come to the
 hermitage, wit ye well he had good cheer. and so daily sir launcelot would
 go to a well fast by the hermitage, and there he would lie down, and see
 the well spring and burble, and sometime he slept there. so at that time
 there was a lady dwelt in that forest, and she was a great huntress, and
 daily she used to hunt, and ever she bare her bow with her; and no men
 went never with her, but always women, and they were shooters, and could
 well kill a deer, both at the stalk and at the trest; and they daily bare
 bows and arrows, horns and wood-knives, and many good dogs they had, both
 for the string and for a bait. so it happed this lady the huntress had
 abated her dog for the bow at a barren hind, and so this barren hind took
 the flight over hedges and woods. and ever this lady and part of her women
 costed the hind, and checked it by the noise of the hounds, to have met
 with the hind at some water; and so it happed, the hind came to the well
 whereas sir launcelot was sleeping and slumbering. and so when the hind
 came to the well, for heat she went to soil, and there she lay a great
 while; and the dog came after, and umbecast about, for she had lost the
 very perfect feute of the hind. right so came that lady the huntress, that
 knew by the dog that she had, that the hind was at the soil in that well;
 and there she came stiffly and found the hind, and she put a broad arrow
 in her bow, and shot at the hind, and over-shot the hind; and so by
 misfortune the arrow smote sir launcelot in the thick of the buttock, over
 the barbs. when sir launcelot felt himself so hurt, he hurled up woodly,
 and saw the lady that had smitten him. and when he saw she was a woman, he
 said thus: lady or damosel, what that thou be, in an evil time bear ye a
 bow; the devil made you a shooter.
 chapter xxii. how launcelot after that he was hurt of a gentlewoman came
 to an hermit, and of other matters.
 now mercy, fair sir, said the lady, i am a gentlewoman that useth here in
 this forest hunting, and god knoweth i saw ye not; but as here was a
 barren hind at the soil in this well, and i weened to have done well, but
 my hand swerved. alas, said sir launcelot, ye have mischieved me. and so
 the lady departed, and sir launcelot as he might pulled out the arrow, and
 left that head still in his buttock, and so he went weakly to the
 hermitage ever more bleeding as he went. and when sir lavaine and the
 hermit espied that sir launcelot was hurt, wit you well they were passing
 heavy, but sir lavaine wist not how that he was hurt nor by whom. and then
 were they wroth out of measure.
 then with great pain the hermit gat out the arrow's head out of sir
 launcelot's buttock, and much of his blood he shed, and the wound was
 passing sore, and unhappily smitten, for it was in such a place that he
 might not sit in no saddle. have mercy, jesu, said sir launcelot, i may
 call myself the most unhappiest man that liveth, for ever when i would
 fainest have worship there befalleth me ever some unhappy thing. now so
 jesu me help, said sir launcelot, and if no man would but god, i shall be
 in the field upon candlemas day at the jousts, whatsomever fall of it: so
 all that might be gotten to heal sir launcelot was had.
 so when the day was come sir launcelot let devise that he was arrayed, and
 sir lavaine, and their horses, as though they had been saracens; and so
 they departed and came nigh to the field. the king of northgalis with an
 hundred knights with him, and the king of northumberland brought with him
 an hundred good knights, and king anguish of ireland brought with him an
 hundred good knights ready to joust, and sir galahad, the haut prince,
 brought with him an hundred good knights, and the king with the hundred
 knights brought with him as many, and all these were proved good knights.
 then came in king arthur's party; and there came in the king of scots with
 an hundred knights, and king uriens of gore brought with him an hundred
 knights, and king howel of brittany brought with him an hundred knights,
 and chaleins of clarance brought with him an hundred knights, and king
 arthur himself came into the field with two hundred knights, and the most
 part were knights of the table round, that were proved noble knights; and
 there were old knights set in scaffolds for to judge, with the queen, who
 did best.
 chapter xxiii. how sir launcelot behaved him at the jousts, and other men
 also.
 then they blew to the field; and there the king of northgalis encountered
 with the king of scots, and there the king of scots had a fall; and the
 king of ireland smote down king uriens; and the king of northumberland
 smote down king howel of brittany; and sir galahad, the haut prince, smote
 down chaleins of clarance. and then king arthur was wood wroth, and ran to
 the king with the hundred knights, and there king arthur smote him down;
 and after with that same spear king arthur smote down three other knights.
 and then when his spear was broken king arthur did passingly well; and so
 therewithal came in sir gawaine and sir gaheris, sir agravaine and sir
 mordred, and there everych of them smote down a knight, and sir gawaine
 smote down four knights; and then there began a strong medley, for then
 there came in the knights of launcelot's blood, and sir gareth and sir
 palomides with them, and many knights of the table round, and they began
 to hold the four kings and the mighty duke so hard that they were
 discomfit; but this duke galahad, the haut prince, was a noble knight, and
 by his mighty prowess of arms he held the knights of the table round
 strait enough.
 all this doing saw sir launcelot, and then he came into the field with sir
 lavaine as it had been thunder. and then anon sir bors and the knights of
 his blood espied sir launcelot, and said to them all: i warn you beware of
 him with the sleeve of gold upon his head, for he is himself sir launcelot
 du lake; and for great goodness sir bors warned sir gareth. i am well
 apaid, said sir gareth, that i may know him. but who is he, said they all,
 that rideth with him in the same array? that is the good and gentle knight
 sir lavaine, said sir bors. so sir launcelot encountered with sir gawaine,
 and there by force sir launcelot smote down sir gawaine and his horse to
 the earth, and so he smote down sir agravaine and sir gaheris, and also he
 smote down sir mordred, and all this was with one spear. then sir lavaine
 met with sir palomides, and either met other so hard and so fiercely that
 both their horses fell to the earth. and then were they horsed again, and
 then met sir launcelot with sir palomides, and there sir palomides had a
 fall; and so sir launcelot or ever he stint, as fast as he might get
 spears, he smote down thirty knights, and the most part of them were
 knights of the table round; and ever the knights of his blood withdrew
 them, and made them ado in other places where sir launcelot came not.
 and then king arthur was wroth when he saw sir launcelot do such deeds;
 and then the king called unto him sir gawaine, sir mordred, sir kay, sir
 griflet, sir lucan the butler, sir bedivere, sir palomides, sir safere,
 his brother; and so the king with these nine knights made them ready to
 set upon sir launcelot, and upon sir lavaine. all this espied sir bors and
 sir gareth. now i dread me sore, said sir bors, that my lord, sir
 launcelot, will be hard matched. by my head, said sir gareth, i will ride
 unto my lord sir launcelot, for to help him, fall of him what fall may,
 for he is the same man that made me knight. ye shall not so, said sir
 bors, by my counsel, unless that ye were disguised. ye shall see me
 disguised, said sir gareth; and therewithal he espied a welsh knight where
 he was to repose him, and he was sore hurt afore by sir gawaine, and to
 him sir gareth rode, and prayed him of his knighthood to lend him his
 shield for his. i will well, said the welsh knight. and when sir gareth
 had his shield, the book saith it was green, with a maiden that seemed in
 it.
 then sir gareth came driving to sir launcelot all that he might and said:
 knight, keep thyself, for yonder cometh king arthur with nine noble
 knights with him to put you to a rebuke, and so i am come to bear you
 fellowship for old love ye have shewed me. gramercy, said sir launcelot.
 sir, said sir gareth, encounter ye with sir gawaine, and i shall encounter
 with sir palomides; and let sir lavaine match with the noble king arthur.
 and when we have delivered them, let us three hold us sadly together. then
 came king arthur with his nine knights with him, and sir launcelot
 encountered with sir gawaine, and gave him such a buffet that the arson of
 his saddle brast, and sir gawaine fell to the earth. then sir gareth
 encountered with the good knight sir palomides, and he gave him such a
 buffet that both his horse and he dashed to the earth. then encountered
 king arthur with sir lavaine, and there either of them smote other to the
 earth, horse and all, that they lay a great while. then sir launcelot
 smote down sir agravaine, and sir gaheris, and sir mordred; and sir gareth
 smote down sir kay, and sir safere, and sir griflet. and then sir lavaine
 was horsed again, and he smote down sir lucan the butler and sir bedevere
 and then there began great throng of good knights.
 then sir launcelot hurtled here and there, and raced and pulled off helms,
 so that at that time there might none sit him a buffet with spear nor with
 sword; and sir gareth did such deeds of arms that all men marvelled what
 knight he was with the green shield, for he smote down that day and pulled
 down mo than thirty knights and, as the french book saith, sir launcelot
 marvelled; when he beheld sir gareth do such deeds, what knight he might
 be; and sir lavaine pulled down and smote down twenty knights. also sir
 launcelot knew not sir gareth for an sir tristram de liones, outher sir
 lamorak de galis had been alive, sir launcelot would have deemed he had
 been one of them twain. so ever as sir launcelot sir gareth, sir lavaine
 fought, and on the one side sir bors, sir ector de maris, sir lionel, sir
 lamorak de galis, sir bleoberis, sir galihud, sir galihodin, sir pelleas,
 and with mo other of king ban's blood fought upon another party, and held
 the king with the hundred knights and the king of northumberland right
 strait.
 chapter xxiv. how king arthur marvelled much of the jousting in the field,
 and how he rode and found sir launcelot.
 so this tournament and this jousts dured long, till it was near night, for
 the knights of the round table relieved ever unto king arthur; for the
 king was wroth out of measure that he and his knights might not prevail
 that day. then sir gawaine said to the king: i marvel where all this day
 [be] sir bors de ganis and his fellowship of sir launcelot's blood, i
 marvel all this day they be not about you: it is for some cause said sir
 gawaine. by my head, said sir kay, sir bors is yonder all this day upon
 the right hand of this field, and there he and his blood do more
 worshipfully than we do. it may well be, said sir gawaine, but i dread me
 ever of guile; for on pain of my life, said sir gawaine, this knight with
 the red sleeve of gold is himself sir launcelot, i see well by his riding
 and by his great strokes; and the other knight in the same colours is the
 good young knight, sir lavaine. also that knight with the green shield is
 my brother, sir gareth, and yet he hath disguised himself, for no man
 shall never make him be against sir launcelot, because he made him knight.
 by my head, said arthur, nephew, i believe you; therefore tell me now what
 is your best counsel. sir, said sir gawaine, ye shall have my counsel: let
 blow unto lodging, for an he be sir launcelot du lake, and my brother, sir
 gareth, with him, with the help of that good young knight, sir lavaine,
 trust me truly it will be no boot to strive with them but if we should
 fall ten or twelve upon one knight, and that were no worship, but shame.
 ye say truth, said the king; and for to say sooth, said the king, it were
 shame to us so many as we be to set upon them any more; for wit ye well,
 said king arthur, they be three good knights, and namely that knight with
 the sleeve of gold.
 so then they blew unto lodging; but forthwithal king arthur let send unto
 the four kings, and to the mighty duke, and prayed them that the knight
 with the sleeve of gold depart not from them, but that the king may speak
 with him. then forthwithal king arthur alighted and unarmed him, and took
 a little hackney and rode after sir launcelot, for ever he had a spy upon
 him. and so he found him among the four kings and the duke; and there the
 king prayed them all unto supper, and they said they would with good will.
 and when they were unarmed then king arthur knew sir launcelot, sir
 lavaine, and sir gareth. ah, sir launcelot, said king arthur, this day ye
 have heated me and my knights.
 so they yede unto arthur's lodging all together, and there was a great
 feast and great revel, and the prize was given unto sir launcelot; and by
 heralds they named him that he had smitten down fifty knights, and sir
 gareth five-and-thirty, and sir lavaine four-and-twenty knights. then sir
 launcelot told the king and the queen how the lady huntress shot him in
 the forest of windsor, in the buttock, with an broad arrow, and how the
 wound thereof was that time six inches deep, and in like long. also arthur
 blamed sir gareth because he left his fellowship and held with sir
 launcelot. my lord, said sir gareth, he made me a knight, and when i saw
 him so hard bestead, methought it was my worship to help him, for i saw
 him do so much, and so many noble knights against him; and when i
 understood that he was sir launcelot du lake, i shamed to see so many
 knights against him alone. truly, said king arthur unto sir gareth, ye say
 well, and worshipfully have ye done and to yourself great worship; and all
 the days of my life, said king arthur unto sir gareth, wit you well i
 shall love you, and trust you the more better. for ever, said arthur, it
 is a worshipful knight's deed to help another worshipful knight when he
 seeth him in a great danger; for ever a worshipful man will be loath to
 see a worshipful man shamed; and he that is of no worship, and fareth with
 cowardice, never shall he show gentleness, nor no manner of goodness where
 he seeth a man in any danger, for then ever will a coward show no mercy;
 and always a good man will do ever to another man as he would be done to
 himself. so then there were great feasts unto kings and dukes, and revel,
 game, and play, and all manner of noblesse was used; and he that was
 courteous, true, and faithful, to his friend was that time cherished.
 chapter xxv. how true love is likened to summer.
 and thus it passed on from candlemass until after easter, that the month
 of may was come, when every lusty heart beginneth to blossom, and to bring
 forth fruit; for like as herbs and trees bring forth fruit and flourish in
 may, in like wise every lusty heart that is in any manner a lover,
 springeth and flourisheth in lusty deeds. for it giveth unto all lovers
 courage, that lusty month of may, in something to constrain him to some
 manner of thing more in that month than in any other month, for divers
 causes. for then all herbs and trees renew a man and woman, and likewise
 lovers call again to their mind old gentleness and old service, and many
 kind deeds that were forgotten by negligence. for like as winter rasure
 doth alway arase and deface green summer, so fareth it by unstable love in
 man and woman. for in many persons there is no stability; for we may see
 all day, for a little blast of winter's rasure, anon we shall deface and
 lay apart true love for little or nought, that cost much thing; this is no
 wisdom nor stability, but it is feebleness of nature and great disworship,
 whosomever useth this. therefore, like as may month flowereth and
 flourisheth in many gardens, so in like wise let every man of worship
 flourish his heart in this world, first unto god, and next unto the joy of
 them that he promised his faith unto; for there was never worshipful man
 or worshipful woman, but they loved one better than another; and worship
 in arms may never be foiled, but first reserve the honour to god, and
 secondly the quarrel must come of thy lady: and such love i call virtuous
 love.
 but nowadays men can not love seven night but they must have all their
 desires: that love may not endure by reason; for where they be soon
 accorded and hasty heat, soon it cooleth. right so fareth love nowadays,
 soon hot soon cold: this is no stability. but the old love was not so; men
 and women could love together seven years, and no licours lusts were
 between them, and then was love, truth, and faithfulness: and lo, in like
 wise was used love in king arthur's days. wherefore i liken love nowadays
 unto summer and winter; for like as the one is hot and the other cold, so
 fareth love nowadays; therefore all ye that be lovers call unto your
 remembrance the month of may, like as did queen guenever, for whom i make
 here a little mention, that while she lived she was a true lover, and
 therefore she had a good end.
explicit liber octodecimus. and here followeth liber xix.
 chapter i. how queen guenever rode a-maying with certain knights of the
 round table and clad all in green.
 so it befell in the month of may, queen guenever called unto her knights
 of the table round; and she gave them warning that early upon the morrow
 she would ride a-maying into woods and fields beside westminster. and i
 warn you that there be none of you but that he be well horsed, and that ye
 all be clothed in green, outher in silk outher in cloth; and i shall bring
 with me ten ladies, and every knight shall have a lady behind him, and
 every knight shall have a squire and two yeomen; and i will that ye all be
 well horsed. so they made them ready in the freshest manner. and these
 were the names of the knights: sir kay le seneschal, sir agravaine, sir
 brandiles, sir sagramore le desirous, sir dodinas le savage, sir ozanna le
 cure hardy, sir ladinas of the forest savage, sir persant of inde, sir
 ironside, that was called the knight of the red launds, and sir pelleas,
 the lover; and these ten knights made them ready in the freshest manner to
 ride with the queen. and so upon the morn they took their horses with the
 queen, and rode a-maying in woods and meadows as it pleased them, in great
 joy and delights; for the queen had cast to have been again with king
 arthur at the furthest by ten of the clock, and so was that time her
 purpose.
 then there was a knight that hight meliagrance, and he was son unto king
 bagdemagus, and this knight had at that time a castle of the gift of king
 arthur within seven mile of westminster. and this knight, sir meliagrance,
 loved passing well queen guenever, and so had he done long and many years.
 and the book saith he had lain in await for to steal away the queen, but
 evermore he forbare for because of sir launcelot; for in no wise he would
 meddle with the queen an sir launcelot were in her company, outher else an
 he were near-hand her. and that time was such a custom, the queen rode
 never without a great fellowship of men of arms about her, and they were
 many good knights, and the most part were young men that would have
 worship; and they were called the queen's knights, and never in no battle,
 tournament, nor jousts, they bare none of them no manner of knowledging of
 their own arms, but plain white shields, and thereby they were called the
 queen's knights. and then when it happed any of them to be of great
 worship by his noble deeds, then at the next feast of pentecost, if there
 were any slain or dead, as there was none year that there failed but some
 were dead, then was there chosen in his stead that was dead the most men
 of worship, that were called the queen's knights. and thus they came up
 all first, or they were renowned men of worship, both sir launcelot and
 all the remnant of them.
 but this knight, sir meliagrance, had espied the queen well and her
 purpose, and how sir launcelot was not with her, and how she had no men of
 arms with her but the ten noble knights all arrayed in green for maying.
 then he purveyed him a twenty men of arms and an hundred archers for to
 destroy the queen and her knights, for he thought that time was best
 season to take the queen.
 chapter ii. how sir meliagrance took the queen and her knights, which were
 sore hurt in fighting
 so as the queen had mayed and all her knights, all were bedashed with
 herbs, mosses and flowers, in the best manner and freshest. right so came
 out of a wood sir meliagrance with an eight score men well harnessed, as
 they should fight in a battle of arrest, and bade the queen and her
 knights abide, for maugre their heads they should abide. traitor knight,
 said queen guenever, what cast thou for to do? wilt thou shame thyself?
 bethink thee how thou art a king's son, and knight of the table round, and
 thou to be about to dishonour the noble king that made thee knight; thou
 shamest all knighthood and thyself, and me, i let thee wit, shalt thou
 never shame, for i had liefer cut mine own throat in twain rather than
 thou shouldest dishonour me. as for all this language, said sir
 meliagrance, be it as it be may, for wit you well, madam, i have loved you
 many a year, and never or now could i get you at such an advantage as i do
 now, and therefore i will take you as i find you.
 then spake all the ten noble knights at once and said: sir meliagrance,
 wit thou well ye are about to jeopard your worship to dishonour, and also
 ye cast to jeopard our persons howbeit we be unarmed. ye have us at a
 great avail, for it seemeth by you that ye have laid watch upon us; but
 rather than ye should put the queen to a shame and us all, we had as lief
 to depart from our lives, for an if we other ways did, we were shamed for
 ever. then said sir meliagrance: dress you as well ye can, and keep the
 queen. then the ten knights of the table round drew their swords, and the
 other let run at them with their spears, and the ten knights manly abode
 them, and smote away their spears that no spear did them none harm. then
 they lashed together with swords, and anon sir kay, sir sagramore, sir
 agravaine, sir dodinas, sir ladinas, and sir ozanna were smitten to the
 earth with grimly wounds. then sir brandiles, and sir persant, sir
 ironside, sir pelleas fought long, and they were sore wounded, for these
 ten knights, or ever they were laid to the ground, slew forty men of the
 boldest and the best of them.
 so when the queen saw her knights thus dolefully wounded, and needs must
 be slain at the last, then for pity and sorrow she cried sir meliagrance:
 slay not my noble knights, and i will go with thee upon this covenant,
 that thou save them, and suffer them not to be no more hurt, with this,
 that they be led with me wheresomever thou leadest me, for i will rather
 slay myself than i will go with thee, unless that these my noble knights
 may be in my presence. madam, said meliagrance, for your sake they shall
 be led with you into mine own castle, with that ye will be ruled, and ride
 with me. then the queen prayed the four knights to leave their fighting,
 and she and they would not depart. madam, said sir pelleas, we will do as
 ye do, for as for me i take no force of my life nor death. for as the
 french book saith, sir pelleas gave such buffets there that none armour
 might hold him.
 chapter iii. how sir launcelot had word how the queen was taken, and how
 sir meliagrance laid a bushment for launcelot
 then by the queen's commandment they left battle, and dressed the wounded
 knights on horseback, some sitting, some overthwart their horses, that it
 was pity to behold them. and then sir meliagrance charged the queen and
 all her knights that none of all her fellowship should depart from her;
 for full sore he dread sir launcelot du lake, lest he should have any
 knowledging. all this espied the queen, and privily she called unto her a
 child of her chamber that was swiftly horsed, to whom she said: go thou,
 when thou seest thy time, and bear this ring unto sir launcelot du lake,
 and pray him as he loveth me that he will see me and rescue me, if ever he
 will have joy of me; and spare not thy horse, said the queen, neither for
 water, neither for land. so the child espied his time, and lightly he took
 his horse with the spurs, and departed as fast as he might. and when sir
 meliagrance saw him so flee, he understood that it was by the queen's
 commandment for to warn sir launcelot. then they that were best horsed
 chased him and shot at him, but from them all the child went suddenly. and
 then sir meliagrance said to the queen: madam, ye are about to betray me,
 but i shall ordain for sir launcelot that he shall not come lightly at
 you. and then he rode with her, and they all, to his castle, in all the
 haste that they might. and by the way sir meliagrance laid in an
 embushment the best archers that he might get in his country, to the
 number of thirty, to await upon sir launcelot, charging them that if they
 saw such a manner of knight come by the way upon a white horse, that in
 any wise they slay his horse, but in no manner of wise have not ado with
 him bodily, for he is over-hardy to be overcome.
 so this was done, and they were come to his castle, but in no wise the
 queen would never let none of the ten knights and her ladies out of her
 sight, but always they were in her presence; for the book saith, sir
 meliagrance durst make no masteries, for dread of sir launcelot, insomuch
 he deemed that he had warning. so when the child was departed from the
 fellowship of sir meliagrance, within a while he came to westminster, and
 anon he found sir launcelot. and when he had told his message, and
 delivered him the queen's ring: alas, said sir launcelot, now i am shamed
 for ever, unless that i may rescue that noble lady from dishonour. then
 eagerly he asked his armour; and ever the child told sir launcelot how the
 ten knights fought marvellously, and how sir pelleas, and sir ironside,
 and sir brandiles, and sir persant of inde, fought strongly, but namely
 sir pelleas, there might none withstand him; and how they all fought till
 at the last they were laid to the earth; and then the queen made
 appointment for to save their lives, and go with sir meliagrance.
 alas, said sir launcelot, that most noble lady, that she should be so
 destroyed; i had liefer, said sir launcelot, than all france, that i had
 been there well armed. so when sir launcelot was armed and upon his horse,
 he prayed the child of the queen's chamber to warn sir lavaine how
 suddenly he was departed, and for what cause. and pray him as he loveth
 me, that he will hie him after me, and that he stint not until he come to
 the castle where sir meliagrance abideth, or dwelleth; for there, said sir
 launcelot, he shall hear of me an i am a man living, and rescue the queen
 and the ten knights the which he traitorously hath taken, and that shall i
 prove upon his head, and all them that hold with him.
 chapter iv. how sir launcelot's horse was slain, and how sir launcelot
 rode in a cart for to rescue the queen
 then sir launcelot rode as fast as he might, and the book saith he took
 the water at westminster bridge, and made his horse to swim over thames
 unto lambeth. and then within a while he came to the same place thereas
 the ten noble knights fought with sir meliagrance. and then sir launcelot
 followed the track until that he came to a wood, and there was a straight
 way, and there the thirty archers bade sir launcelot turn again, and
 follow no longer that track. what commandment have ye thereto, said sir
 launcelot, to cause me that am a knight of the round table to leave my
 right way? this way shalt thou leave, other-else thou shalt go it on thy
 foot, for wit thou well thy horse shall be slain. that is little mastery,
 said sir launcelot, to slay mine horse; but as for myself, when my horse
 is slain, i give right nought for you, not an ye were five hundred more.
 so then they shot sir launcelot's horse, and smote him with many arrows;
 and then sir launcelot avoided his horse, and went on foot; but there were
 so many ditches and hedges betwixt them and him that he might not meddle
 with none of them. alas for shame, said launcelot, that ever one knight
 should betray another knight; but it is an old saw, a good man is never in
 danger but when he is in the danger of a coward. then sir launcelot went a
 while, and then he was foul cumbered of his armour, his shield, and his
 spear, and all that longed unto him. wit ye well he was full sore annoyed,
 and full loath he was for to leave anything that longed unto him, for he
 dread sore the treason of sir meliagrance.
 then by fortune there came by him a chariot that came thither for to fetch
 wood. say me, carter, said sir launcelot, what shall i give thee to suffer
 me to leap into thy chariot, and that thou bring me unto a castle within
 this two mile? thou shalt not come within my chariot, said the carter, for
 i am sent for to fetch wood for my lord, sir meliagrance. with him would i
 speak. thou shalt not go with me, said the carter. then sir launcelot
 leapt to him, and gave him such a buffet that he fell to the earth stark
 dead. then the other carter, his fellow, was afeard, and weened to have
 gone the same way; and then he cried: fair lord, save my life, and i shall
 bring you where ye will. then i charge thee, said sir launcelot, that thou
 drive me and this chariot even unto sir meliagrance's gate. leap up into
 the chariot, said the carter, and ye shall be there anon. so the carter
 drove on a great wallop, and sir launcelot's horse followed the chariot,
 with more than a forty arrows broad and rough in him.
 and more than an hour and an half dame guenever was awaiting in a bay
 window with her ladies, and espied an armed knight standing in a chariot.
 see, madam, said a lady, where rideth in a chariot a goodly armed knight;
 i suppose he rideth unto hanging. where? said the queen. then she espied
 by his shield that he was there himself, sir launcelot du lake. and then
 she was ware where came his horse ever after that chariot, and ever he
 trod his guts and his paunch under his feet. alas, said the queen, now i
 see well and prove, that well is him that hath a trusty friend. ha, ha,
 most noble knight, said queen guenever, i see well thou art hard bestead
 when thou ridest in a chariot. then she rebuked that lady that likened sir
 launcelot to ride in a chariot to hanging. it was foul mouthed, said the
 queen, and evil likened, so for to liken the most noble knight of the
 world unto such a shameful death. o jesu defend him and keep him, said the
 queen, from all mischievous end. by this was sir launcelot come to the
 gates of that castle, and there he descended down, and cried, that all the
 castle rang of it: where art thou, false traitor, sir meliagrance, and
 knight of the table round? now come forth here, thou traitor knight, thou
 and thy fellowship with thee; for here i am, sir launcelot du lake, that
 shall fight with you. and therewithal he bare the gate wide open upon the
 porter, and smote him under his ear with his gauntlet, that his neck brast
 a-sunder.
 chapter v. how sir meliagrance required forgiveness of the queen, and how
 she appeased sir launcelot; and other matters
 when sir meliagrance heard that sir launcelot was there he ran unto queen
 guenever, and fell upon his knee, and said: mercy, madam, now i put me
 wholly into your grace. what aileth you now? said queen guenever; forsooth
 i might well wit some good knight would revenge me, though my lord arthur
 wist not of this your work. madam, said sir meliagrance, all this that is
 amiss on my part shall be amended right as yourself will devise, and
 wholly i put me in your grace. what would ye that i did? said the queen. i
 would no more, said meliagrance, but that ye would take all in your own
 hands, and that ye will rule my lord sir launcelot; and such cheer as may
 be made him in this poor castle ye and he shall have until to-morn, and
 then may ye and all they return unto westminster; and my body and all that
 i have i shall put in your rule. ye say well, said the queen, and better
 is peace than ever war, and the less noise the more is my worship.
 then the queen and her ladies went down unto the knight, sir launcelot,
 that stood wroth out of measure in the inner court, to abide battle; and
 ever he bade: thou traitor knight come forth. then the queen came to him
 and said: sir launcelot, why be ye so moved? ha, madam, said sir
 launcelot, why ask ye me that question? meseemeth, said sir launcelot, ye
 ought to be more wroth than i am, for ye have the hurt and the dishonour,
 for wit ye well, madam, my hurt is but little for the killing of a mare's
 son, but the despite grieveth me much more than all my hurt. truly, said
 the queen, ye say truth; but heartily i thank you, said the queen, but ye
 must come in with me peaceably, for all thing is put in my hand, and all
 that is evil shall be for the best, for the knight full sore repenteth him
 of the misadventure that is befallen him. madam, said sir launcelot, sith
 it is so that ye been accorded with him, as for me i may not be again it,
 howbeit sir meliagrance hath done full shamefully to me, and cowardly. ah
 madam, said sir launcelot, an i had wist ye would have been so soon
 accorded with him i would not have made such haste unto you. why say ye
 so, said the queen, do ye forthink yourself of your good deeds? wit you
 well, said the queen, i accorded never unto him for favour nor love that i
 had unto him, but for to lay down every shameful noise. madam, said sir
 launcelot, ye understand full well i was never willing nor glad of
 shameful slander nor noise; and there is neither king, queen, nor knight,
 that beareth the life, except my lord king arthur, and you, madam, should
 let me, but i should make sir meliagrance's heart full cold or ever i
 departed from hence. that wot i well, said the queen, but what will ye
 more? ye shall have all thing ruled as ye list to have it. madam, said sir
 launcelot, so ye be pleased i care not, as for my part ye shall soon
 please.
 right so the queen took sir launcelot by the bare hand, for he had put off
 his gauntlet, and so she went with him till her chamber; and then she
 commanded him to be unarmed. and then sir launcelot asked where were the
 ten knights that were wounded sore; so she showed them unto sir launcelot,
 and there they made great joy of the coming of him, and sir launcelot made
 great dole of their hurts, and bewailed them greatly. and there sir
 launcelot told them how cowardly and traitorly meliagrance set archers to
 slay his horse, and how he was fain to put himself in a chariot. thus they
 complained everych to other; and full fain they would have been revenged,
 but they peaced themselves because of the queen. then, as the french book
 saith, sir launcelot was called many a day after le chevaler du chariot,
 and did many deeds, and great adventures he had. and so leave we of this
 tale le chevaler du chariot, and turn we to this tale.
 so sir launcelot had great cheer with the queen, and then sir launcelot
 made a promise with the queen that the same night sir launcelot should
 come to a window outward toward a garden; and that window was y-barred
 with iron, and there sir launcelot promised to meet her when all folks
 were asleep. so then came sir lavaine driving to the gates, crying: where
 is my lord, sir launcelot du lake? then was he sent for, and when sir
 lavaine saw sir launcelot, he said: my lord, i found well how ye were hard
 bestead, for i have found your horse that was slain with arrows. as for
 that, said sir launcelot, i pray you, sir lavaine, speak ye of other
 matters, and let ye this pass, and we shall right it another time when we
 best may.
 chapter vi. how sir launcelot came in the night to the queen and lay with
 her, and how sir meliagrance appeached the queen of treason
 then the knights that were hurt were searched, and soft salves were laid
 to their wounds; and so it passed on till supper time, and all the cheer
 that might be made them there was done unto the queen and all her knights.
 then when season was, they went unto their chambers, but in no wise the
 queen would not suffer the wounded knights to be from her, but that they
 were laid within draughts by her chamber, upon beds and pillows, that she
 herself might see to them, that they wanted nothing.
 so when sir launcelot was in his chamber that was assigned unto him, he
 called unto him sir lavaine, and told him that night he must go speak with
 his lady, dame guenever. sir, said sir lavaine, let me go with you an it
 please you, for i dread me sore of the treason of sir meliagrance. nay,
 said sir launcelot, i thank you, but i will have nobody with me. then sir
 launcelot took his sword in his hand, and privily went to a place where he
 had espied a ladder to-forehand, and that he took under his arm, and bare
 it through the garden, and set it up to the window, and there anon the
 queen was ready to meet him. and then they made either to other their
 complaints of many divers things, and then sir launcelot wished that he
 might have come into her. wit ye well, said the queen, i would as fain as
 ye, that ye might come in to me. would ye, madam, said sir launcelot, with
 your heart that i were with you? yea, truly, said the queen. now shall i
 prove my might, said sir launcelot, for your love; and then he set his
 hands upon the bars of iron, and he pulled at them with such a might that
 he brast them clean out of the stone walls, and therewithal one of the
 bars of iron cut the brawn of his hands throughout to the bone; and then
 he leapt into the chamber to the queen. make ye no noise, said the queen,
 for my wounded knights lie here fast by me. so, to pass upon this tale,
 sir launcelot went unto bed with the queen, and he took no force of his
 hurt hand, but took his pleasaunce and his liking until it was in the
 dawning of the day; and wit ye well he slept not but watched, and when he
 saw his time that he might tarry no longer he took his leave and departed
 at the window, and put it together as well as he might again, and so
 departed unto his own chamber; and there he told sir lavaine how he was
 hurt. then sir lavaine dressed his hand and staunched it, and put upon it
 a glove, that it should not be espied; and so the queen lay long in her
 bed until it was nine of the clock.
 then sir meliagrance went to the queen's chamber, and found her ladies
 there ready clothed. jesu mercy, said sir meliagrance, what aileth you,
 madam, that ye sleep thus long? and right therewithal he opened the
 curtain for to behold her; and then was he ware where she lay, and all the
 sheet and pillow was bebled with the blood of sir launcelot and of his
 hurt hand. when sir meliagrance espied that blood, then he deemed in her
 that she was false to the king, and that some of the wounded knights had
 lain by her all that night. ah, madam, said sir meliagrance, now i have
 found you a false traitress unto my lord arthur; for now i prove well it
 was not for nought that ye laid these wounded knights within the bounds of
 your chamber; therefore i will call you of treason before my lord, king
 arthur. and now i have proved you, madam, with a shameful deed; and that
 they be all false, or some of them, i will make good, for a wounded knight
 this night hath lain by you. that is false, said the queen, and that i
 will report me unto them all. then when the ten knights heard sir
 meliagrance's words, they spake all in one voice and said to sir
 meliagrance: thou sayest falsely, and wrongfully puttest upon us such a
 deed, and that we will make good any of us; choose which thou list of us
 when we are whole of our wounds. ye shall not, said sir meliagrance, away
 with your proud language, for here ye may all see, said sir meliagrance,
 that by the queen this night a wounded knight hath lain. then were they
 all ashamed when they saw that blood; and wit you well sir meliagrance was
 passing glad that he had the queen at such an advantage, for he deemed by
 that to hide his treason. so with this rumour came in sir launcelot, and
 found them all at a great array.
 chapter vii. how sir launcelot answered for the queen, and waged battle
 against sir meliagrance; and how sir launcelot was taken in a trap
 what array is this? said sir launcelot. then sir meliagrance told them
 what he had found, and showed them the queen's bed. truly, said sir
 launcelot, ye did not your part nor knightly, to touch a queen's bed while
 it was drawn, and she lying therein; for i dare say my lord arthur himself
 would not have displayed her curtains, she being within her bed, unless
 that it had pleased him to have lain down by her; and therefore ye have
 done unworshipfully and shamefully to yourself. i wot not what ye mean,
 said sir meliagrance, but well i am sure there hath one of her wounded
 knights lain by her this night, and therefore i will prove with my hands
 that she is a traitress unto my lord arthur. beware what ye do, said
 launcelot, for an ye say so, an ye will prove it, it will be taken at your
 hands.
 my lord, sir launcelot, said sir meliagrance, i rede you beware what ye
 do; for though ye are never so good a knight, as ye wot well ye are
 renowned the best knight of the world, yet should ye be advised to do
 battle in a wrong quarrel, for god will have a stroke in every battle. as
 for that, said sir launcelot, god is to be dread; but as to that i say nay
 plainly, that this night there lay none of these ten wounded knights with
 my lady queen guenever, and that will i prove with my hands, that ye say
 untruly in that now. hold, said sir meliagrance, here is my glove that she
 is traitress unto my lord, king arthur, and that this night one of the
 wounded knights lay with her. and i receive your glove, said sir
 launcelot. and so they were sealed with their signets, and delivered unto
 the ten knights. at what day shall we do battle together? said sir
 launcelot. this day ight days, said sir meliagrance, in the field beside
 westminster. i am agreed, said sir launcelot. but now, said sir
 meliagrance, sithen it is so that we must fight together, i pray you, as
 ye be a noble knight, await me with no treason, nor none villainy the
 meanwhile, nor none for you. so god me help, said sir launcelot, ye shall
 right well wit i was never of no such conditions, for i report me to all
 knights that ever have known me, i fared never with no treason, nor i
 loved never the fellowship of no man that fared with treason. then let us
 go to dinner, said meliagrance, and after dinner ye and the queen and ye
 may ride all to westminster. i will well, said sir launcelot.
 then sir meliagrance said to sir launcelot: pleaseth it you to see the
 estures of this castle? with a good will, said sir launcelot. and then
 they went together from chamber to chamber, for sir launcelot dread no
 perils; for ever a man of worship and of prowess dreadeth least always
 perils, for they ween every man be as they be; but ever he that fareth
 with treason putteth oft a man in great danger. so it befell upon sir
 launcelot that no peril dread, as he went with sir meliagrance he trod on
 a trap and the board rolled, and there sir launcelot fell down more than
 ten fathom into a cave full of straw; and then sir meliagrance departed
 and made no fare as that he nist where he was.
 and when sir launcelot was thus missed they marvelled where he was become;
 and then the queen and many of them deemed that he was departed as he was
 wont to do suddenly. for sir meliagrance made suddenly to put away aside
 sir lavaine's horse, that they might all understand that sir launcelot was
 departed suddenly. so it passed on till after dinner; and then sir lavaine
 would not stint until that he ordained litters for the wounded knights,
 that they might be laid in them; and so with the queen and them all, both
 ladies and gentlewomen and other, went unto westminster; and there the
 knights told king arthur how meliagrance had appealed the queen of high
 treason, and how sir launcelot had received the glove of him: and this day
 eight days they shall do battle afore you. by my head, said king arthur, i
 am afeard sir meliagrance hath taken upon him a great charge; but where is
 sir launcelot? said the king. sir, said they all, we wot not where he is,
 but we deem he is ridden to some adventures, as he is ofttimes wont to do,
 for he hath sir lavaine's horse. let him be, said the king, he will be
 founden, but if he be trapped with some treason.
 chapter viii. how sir launcelot was delivered out of prison by a lady, and
 took a white courser and came for to keep his day
 so leave we sir launcelot lying within that cave in great pain; and every
 day there came a lady and brought him his meat and his drink, and wooed
 him, to have lain by him; and ever the noble knight, sir launcelot, said
 her nay. sir launcelot, said she, ye are not wise, for ye may never out of
 this prison, but if ye have my help; and also your lady, queen guenever,
 shall be brent in your default, unless that ye be there at the day of
 battle. god defend, said sir launcelot, that she should be brent in my
 default; and if it be so, said sir launcelot, that i may not be there, it
 shall be well understanded, both at the king and at the queen, and with
 all men of worship, that i am dead, sick, outher in prison. for all men
 that know me will say for me that i am in some evil case an i be not there
 that day; and well i wot there is some good knight either of my blood, or
 some other that loveth me, that will take my quarrel in hand; and
 therefore, said sir launcelot, wit ye well ye shall not fear me; and if
 there were no more women in all this land but ye, i will not have ado with
 you. then art thou shamed, said the lady, and destroyed for ever. as for
 world's shame, jesu defend me, and as for my distress, it is welcome
 whatsoever it be that god sendeth me.
 so she came to him the same day that the battle should be, and said: sir
 launcelot, methinketh ye are too hard-hearted, but wouldest thou but kiss
 me once i should deliver thee, and thine armour, and the best horse that
 is within sir meliagrance's stable. as for to kiss you, said sir
 launcelot, i may do that and lose no worship; and wit ye well an i
 understood there were any disworship for to kiss you i would not do it.
 then he kissed her, and then she gat him, and brought him to his armour.
 and when he was armed, she brought him to a stable, where stood twelve
 good coursers, and bade him choose the best. then sir launcelot looked
 upon a white courser the which liked him best; and anon he commanded the
 keepers fast to saddle him with the best saddle of war that there was; and
 so it was done as he bade. then gat he his spear in his hand, and his
 sword by his side, and commended the lady unto god, and said: lady, for
 this good deed i shall do you service if ever it be in my power.
 chapter ix. how sir launcelot came the same time that sir meliagrance
 abode him in the field and dressed him to battle
 now leave we sir launcelot wallop all that he might, and speak we of queen
 guenever that was brought to a fire to be brent; for sir meliagrance was
 sure, him thought, that sir launcelot should not be at that battle;
 therefore he ever cried upon king arthur to do him justice, other-else
 bring forth sir launcelot du lake. then was the king and all the court
 full sore abashed and shamed that the queen should be brent in the default
 of sir launcelot. my lord arthur, said sir lavaine, ye may understand that
 it is not well with my lord sir launcelot, for an he were alive, so he be
 not sick outher in prison, wit ye well he would be here; for never heard
 ye that ever he failed his part for whom he should do battle for. and
 therefore, said sir lavaine, my lord, king arthur, i beseech you give me
 license to do battle here this day for my lord and master, and for to save
 my lady, the queen. gramercy gentle sir lavaine, said king arthur, for i
 dare say all that sir meliagrance putteth upon my lady the queen is wrong,
 for i have spoken with all the ten wounded knights, and there is not one
 of them, an he were whole and able to do battle, but he would prove upon
 sir meliagrance's body that it is false that he putteth upon my queen. so
 shall i, said sir lavaine, in the defence of my lord, sir launcelot, an ye
 will give me leave. now i give you leave, said king arthur, and do your
 best, for i dare well say there is some treason done to sir launcelot
 then was sir lavaine armed and horsed, and suddenly at the lists' end he
 rode to perform this battle; and right as the heralds should cry: lesses
 les aler, right so came in sir launcelot driving with all the force of his
 horse. and then arthur cried: ho! and abide! then was sir launcelot called
 on horseback to-fore king arthur, and there he told openly to-fore the
 king and all, how sir meliagrance had served him first to last. and when
 the king, and the queen, and all the lords, knew of the treason of sir
 meliagrance they were all ashamed on his behalf. then was queen guenever
 sent for, and set by the king in great trust of her champion. and then
 there was no more else to say, but sir launcelot and sir meliagrance
 dressed them unto battle, and took their spears; and so they came together
 as thunder, and there sir launcelot bare him down quite over his horse's
 croup. and then sir launcelot alighted and dressed his shield on his
 shoulder, with his sword in his hand, and sir meliagrance in the same wise
 dressed him unto him, and there they smote many great strokes together;
 and at the last sir launcelot smote him such a buffet upon the helmet that
 he fell on the one side to the earth. and then he cried upon him aloud:
 most noble knight, sir launcelot du lake, save my life, for i yield me
 unto you, and i require you, as ye be a knight and fellow of the table
 round, slay me not, for i yield me as overcome; and whether i shall live
 or die i put me in the king's hands and yours.
 then sir launcelot wist not what to do, for he had had liefer than all the
 good of the world he might have been revenged upon sir meliagrance; and
 sir launcelot looked up to the queen guenever, if he might espy by any
 sign or countenance what she would have done. and then the queen wagged
 her head upon sir launcelot, as though she would say: slay him. full well
 knew sir launcelot by the wagging of her head that she would have him
 dead; then sir launcelot bade him rise for shame and perform that battle
 to the utterance. nay, said sir meliagrance, i will never arise until ye
 take me as yolden and recreant. i shall proffer you large proffers, said
 sir launcelot, that is for to say, i shall unarm my head and my left
 quarter of my body, all that may be unarmed, and let bind my left hand
 behind me, so that it shall not help me, and right so i shall do battle
 with you. then sir meliagrance started up upon his legs, and said on high:
 my lord arthur, take heed to this proffer, for i will take it, and let him
 be disarmed and bounden according to his proffer. what say ye, said king
 arthur unto sir launcelot, will ye abide by your proffer? yea, my lord,
 said sir launcelot, i will never go from that i have once said.
 then the knights parters of the field disarmed sir launcelot, first his
 head, and sithen his left arm, and his left side, and they bound his left
 arm behind his back, without shield or anything, and then they were put
 together. wit you well there was many a lady and knight marvelled that sir
 launcelot would jeopardy himself in such wise. then sir meliagrance came
 with his sword all on high, and sir launcelot showed him openly his bare
 head and the bare left side; and when he weened to have smitten him upon
 the bare head, then lightly he avoided the left leg and the left side, and
 put his right hand and his sword to that stroke, and so put it on side
 with great sleight; and then with great force sir launcelot smote him on
 the helmet such a buffet that the stroke carved the head in two parts.
 then there was no more to do, but he was drawn out of the field. and at
 the great instance of the knights of the table round, the king suffered
 him to be interred, and the mention made upon him, who slew him, and for
 what cause he was slain; and then the king and the queen made more of sir
 launcelot du lake, and more he was cherished, than ever he was aforehand.
 chapter x. how sir urre came into arthur's court for to be healed of his
 wounds, and how king arthur would begin to handle him
 then as the french book maketh mention, there was a good knight in the
 land of hungary, his name was sir urre, and he was an adventurous knight,
 and in all places where he might hear of any deeds of worship there would
 he be. so it happened in spain there was an earl's son, his name was
 alphegus, and at a great tournament in spain this sir urre, knight of
 hungary, and sir alphegus of spain encountered together for very envy; and
 so either undertook other to the utterance. and by fortune sir urre slew
 sir alphegus, the earl's son of spain, but this knight that was slain had
 given sir urre, or ever he was slain, seven great wounds, three on the
 head, and four on his body and upon his left hand. and this sir alphegus
 had a mother, the which was a great sorceress; and she, for the despite of
 her son's death, wrought by her subtle crafts that sir urre should never
 be whole, but ever his wounds should one time fester and another time
 bleed, so that he should never be whole until the best knight of the world
 had searched his wounds; and thus she made her avaunt, wherethrough it was
 known that sir urre should never be whole.
 then his mother let make an horse litter, and put him therein under two
 palfreys; and then she took sir urre's sister with him, a full fair
 damosel, whose name was felelolie; and then she took a page with him to
 keep their horses, and so they led sir urre through many countries. for as
 the french book saith, she led him so seven year through all lands
 christened, and never she could find no knight that might ease her son. so
 she came into scotland and into the lands of england, and by fortune she
 came nigh the feast of pentecost until king arthur's court, that at that
 time was holden at carlisle. and when she came there, then she made it
 openly to be known how that she was come into that land for to heal her
 son.
 then king arthur let call that lady, and asked her the cause why she
 brought that hurt knight into that land. my most noble king, said that
 lady, wit you well i brought him hither for to be healed of his wounds,
 that of all this seven year he might not be whole. and then she told the
 king where he was wounded, and of whom; and how his mother had discovered
 in her pride how she had wrought that by enchantment, so that he should
 never be whole until the best knight of the world had searched his wounds.
 and so i have passed through all the lands christened to have him healed,
 except this land. and if i fail to heal him here in this land, i will
 never take more pain upon me, and that is pity, for he was a good knight,
 and of great nobleness. what is his name? said arthur my good and gracious
 lord, she said, his name is sir urre of the mount. in good time, said the
 king, and sith ye are come into this land, ye are right welcome; and wit
 you well here shall your son be healed, an ever any christian man may heal
 him. and for to give all other men of worship courage, i myself will assay
 to handle your son, and so shall all the kings, dukes, and earls that be
 here present with me at this time; thereto will i command them, and well i
 wot they shall obey and do after my commandment. and wit you well, said
 king arthur unto urre's sister, i shall begin to handle him, and search
 unto my power, not presuming upon me that i am so worthy to heal your son
 by my deeds, but i will courage other men of worship to do as i will do.
 and then the king commanded all the kings, dukes, and earls, and all noble
 knights of the round table that were there that time present, to come into
 the meadow of carlisle. and so at that time there were but an hundred and
 ten of the round table, for forty knights were that time away; and so here
 we must begin at king arthur, as is kindly to begin at him that was the
 most man of worship that was christened at that time.
 chapter xi. how king arthur handled sir urre, and after him many other
 knights of the round table
 then king arthur looked upon sir urre, and the king thought he was a full
 likely man when he was whole; and then king arthur made him to be taken
 down off the litter and laid him upon the earth, and there was laid a
 cushion of gold that he should kneel upon. and then noble arthur said:
 fair knight, me repenteth of thy hurt, and for to courage all other noble
 knights i will pray thee softly to suffer me to handle your wounds. most
 noble christened king, said urre, do as ye list, for i am at the mercy of
 god, and at your commandment. so then arthur softly handled him, and then
 some of his wounds renewed upon bleeding. then the king clarence of
 northumberland searched, and it would not be. and then sir barant le apres
 that was called the king with the hundred knights, he assayed and failed;
 and so did king uriens of the land of gore; so did king anguish of
 ireland; so did king nentres of garloth; so did king carados of scotland;
 so did the duke galahad, the haut prince; so did constantine, that was sir
 carados' son of cornwall; so did duke chaleins of clarance; so did the
 earl ulbause; so did the earl lambaile; so did the earl aristause.
 then came in sir gawaine with his three sons, sir gingalin, sir florence,
 and sir lovel, these two were begotten upon sir brandiles' sister; and all
 they failed. then came in sir agravaine, sir gaheris, sir mordred, and the
 good knight, sir gareth, that was of very knighthood worth all the
 brethren. so came knights of launcelot's kin, but sir launcelot was not
 that time in the court, for he was that time upon his adventures. then sir
 lionel, sir ector de maris, sir bors de ganis, sir blamore de ganis, sir
 bleoberis de ganis, sir gahalantine, sir galihodin, sir menaduke, sir
 villiars the valiant, sir hebes le renoumes. all these were of sir
 launcelot's kin, and all they failed. then came in sir sagramore le
 desirous, sir dodinas le savage, sir dinadan, sir bruin le noire, that sir
 kay named la cote male taile, and sir kay le seneschal, sir kay de
 stranges, sir meliot de logris, sir petipase of winchelsea, sir galleron
 of galway, sir melion of the mountain, sir cardok, sir uwaine les
 avoutres, and sir ozanna le cure hardy.
 then came in sir astamor, and sir gromere, grummor's son, sir crosselm,
 sir servause le breuse, that was called a passing strong knight, for as
 the book saith, the chief lady of the lake feasted sir launcelot and
 servause le breuse, and when she had feasted them both at sundry times she
 prayed them to give her a boon. and they granted it her. and then she
 prayed sir servause that he would promise her never to do battle against
 sir launcelot du lake, and in the same wise she prayed sir launcelot never
 to do battle against sir servause, and so either promised her. for the
 french book saith, that sir servause had never courage nor lust to do
 battle against no man, but if it were against giants, and against dragons,
 and wild beasts. so we pass unto them that at the king's request made them
 all that were there at that high feast, as of the knights of the table
 round, for to search sir urre: to that intent the king did it, to wit
 which was the noblest knight among them.
 then came sir aglovale, sir durnore, sir tor, that was begotten upon
 aries, the cowherd's wife, but he was begotten afore aries wedded her, and
 king pellinore begat them all, first sir tor, sir aglovale, sir durnore,
 sir lamorak, the most noblest knight one that ever was in arthur's days as
 for a worldly knight, and sir percivale that was peerless except sir
 galahad in holy deeds, but they died in the quest of the sangreal. then
 came sir griflet le fise de dieu, sir lucan the butler, sir bedevere his
 brother, sir brandiles, sir constantine, sir cador's son of cornwall, that
 was king after arthur's days, and sir clegis, sir sadok, sir dinas le
 seneschal of cornwall, sir fergus, sir driant, sir lambegus, sir clarrus
 of cleremont, sir cloddrus, sir hectimere, sir edward of carnarvon, sir
 dinas, sir priamus, that was christened by sir tristram the noble knight,
 and these three were brethren; sir hellaine le blank that was son to sir
 bors, he begat him upon king brandegoris' daughter, and sir brian de
 listinoise; sir gautere, sir reynold, sir gillemere, were three brethren
 that sir launcelot won upon a bridge in sir kay's arms. sir guyart le
 petite, sir bellangere le beuse, that was son to the good knight, sir
 alisander le orphelin, that was slain by the treason of king mark. also
 that traitor king slew the noble knight sir tristram, as he sat harping
 afore his lady la beale isoud, with a trenchant glaive, for whose death
 was much bewailing of every knight that ever were in arthur's days; there
 was never none so bewailed as was sir tristram and sir lamorak, for they
 were traitorously slain, sir tristram by king mark, and sir lamorak by sir
 gawaine and his brethren. and this sir bellangere revenged the death of
 his father alisander, and sir tristram slew king mark, and la beale isoud
 died swooning upon the corse of sir tristram, whereof was great pity. and
 all that were with king mark that were consenting to the death of sir
 tristram were slain, as sir andred and many other.
 then came sir hebes, sir morganore, sir sentraile, sir suppinabilis, sir
 bellangere le orgulous, that the good knight sir lamorak won in plain
 battle; sir neroveus and sir plenorius, two good knights that sir
 launcelot won; sir darras, sir harry le fise lake, sir erminide, brother
 to king hermaunce, for whom sir palomides fought at the red city with two
 brethren; and sir selises of the dolorous tower, sir edward of orkney, sir
 ironside, that was called the noble knight of the red launds that sir
 gareth won for the love of dame liones, sir arrok de grevaunt, sir degrane
 saunce velany that fought with the giant of the black lowe, sir epinogris,
 that was the king's son of northumberland. sir pelleas that loved the lady
 ettard, and he had died for her love had not been one of the ladies of the
 lake, her name was dame nimue, and she wedded sir pelleas, and she saved
 him that he was never slain, and he was a full noble knight; and sir
 lamiel of cardiff that was a great lover. sir plaine de fors, sir melleaus
 de lile, sir bohart le cure hardy that was king arthur's son, sir mador de
 la porte, sir colgrevance, sir hervise de la forest savage, sir marrok,
 the good knight that was betrayed with his wife, for she made him seven
 year a wer-wolf, sir persaunt, sir pertilope, his brother, that was called
 the green knight, and sir perimones, brother to them both, that was called
 the red knight, that sir gareth won when he was called beaumains. all
 these hundred knights and ten searched sir urre's wounds by the
 commandment of king arthur.
 chapter xii. how sir launcelot was commanded by arthur to handle his
 wounds, and anon he was all whole, and how they thanked god
 mercy jesu, said king arthur, where is sir launcelot du lake that he is
 not here at this time? thus, as they stood and spake of many things, there
 was espied sir launcelot that came riding toward them, and told the king.
 peace, said the king, let no manner thing be said until he be come to us.
 so when sir launcelot espied king arthur, he descended from his horse and
 came to the king, and saluted him and them all. anon as the maid, sir
 urre's sister, saw sir launcelot, she ran to her brother thereas he lay in
 his litter, and said: brother, here is come a knight that my heart giveth
 greatly unto. fair sister, said sir urre, so doth my heart light against
 him, and certainly i hope now to be healed, for my heart giveth unto him
 more than to all these that have searched me.
 then said arthur unto sir launcelot: ye must do as we have done; and told
 sir launcelot what they had done, and showed him them all, that had
 searched him. jesu defend me, said sir launcelot, when so many kings and
 knights have assayed and failed, that i should presume upon me to enchieve
 that all ye, my lords, might not enchieve. ye shall not choose, said king
 arthur, for i will command you for to do as we all have done. my most
 renowned lord, said sir launcelot, ye know well i dare not nor may not
 disobey your commandment, but an i might or durst, wit you well i would
 not take upon me to touch that wounded knight in that intent that i should
 pass all other knights; jesu defend me from that shame. ye take it wrong,
 said king arthur, ye shall not do it for no presumption, but for to bear
 us fellowship, insomuch ye be a fellow of the table round; and wit you
 well, said king arthur, an ye prevail not and heal him, i dare say there
 is no knight in this land may heal him, and therefore i pray you, do as we
 have done.
 and then all the kings and knights for the most part prayed sir launcelot
 to search him; and then the wounded knight, sir urre, set him up weakly,
 and prayed sir launcelot heartily, saying: courteous knight, i require
 thee for god's sake heal my wounds, for methinketh ever sithen ye came
 here my wounds grieve me not. ah, my fair lord, said sir launcelot, jesu
 would that i might help you; i shame me sore that i should be thus
 rebuked, for never was i able in worthiness to do so high a thing. then
 sir launcelot kneeled down by the wounded knight saying: my lord arthur, i
 must do your commandment, the which is sore against my heart. and then he
 held up his hands, and looked into the east, saying secretly unto himself:
 thou blessed father, son, and holy ghost, i beseech thee of thy mercy,
 that my simple worship and honesty be saved, and thou blessed trinity,
 thou mayst give power to heal this sick knight by thy great virtue and
 grace of thee, but, good lord, never of myself. and then sir launcelot
 prayed sir urre to let him see his head; and then devoutly kneeling he
 ransacked the three wounds, that they bled a little, and forthwith all the
 wounds fair healed, and seemed as they had been whole a seven year. and in
 likewise he searched his body of other three wounds, and they healed in
 likewise; and then the last of all he searched the which was in his hand,
 and anon it healed fair.
 then king arthur and all the kings and knights kneeled down and gave
 thankings and lovings unto god and to his blessed mother. and ever sir
 launcelot wept as he had been a child that had been beaten. then king
 arthur let array priests and clerks in the most devoutest manner, to bring
 in sir urre within carlisle, with singing and loving to god. and when this
 was done, the king let clothe him in the richest manner that could be
 thought; and then were there but few better made knights in all the court,
 for he was passingly well made and bigly; and arthur asked sir urre how he
 felt himself. my good lord, he said, i felt myself never so lusty. will ye
 joust and do deeds of arms? said king arthur. sir, said urre, an i had all
 that longed unto jousts i would be soon ready.
 chapter xiii. how there was a party made of an hundred knights against an
 hundred knights, and of other matters
 then arthur made a party of hundred knights to be against an hundred
 knights. and so upon the morn they jousted for a diamond, but there
 jousted none of the dangerous knights; and so for to shorten this tale,
 sir urre and sir lavaine jousted best that day, for there was none of them
 but he overthrew and pulled down thirty knights; and then by the assent of
 all the kings and lords, sir urre and sir lavaine were made knights of the
 table round. and sir lavaine cast his love unto dame felelolie, sir urre's
 sister, and then they were wedded together with great joy, and king arthur
 gave to everych of them a barony of lands. and this sir urre would never
 go from sir launcelot, but he and sir lavaine awaited evermore upon him;
 and they were in all the court accounted for good knights, and full
 desirous in arms; and many noble deeds they did, for they would have no
 rest, but ever sought adventures.
 thus they lived in all that court with great noblesse and joy long time.
 but every night and day sir agravaine, sir gawaine's brother, awaited
 queen guenever and sir launcelot du lake to put them to a rebuke and
 shame. and so i leave here of this tale, and overskip great books of sir
 launcelot du lake, what great adventures he did when he was called le
 chevaler du chariot. for as the french book saith, because of despite that
 knights and ladies called him the knight that rode in the chariot like as
 he were judged to the gallows, therefore in despite of all them that named
 him so, he was carried in a chariot a twelvemonth, for, but little after
 that he had slain sir meliagrance in the queen's quarrel, he never in a
 twelvemonth came on horseback. and as the french book saith, he did that
 twelvemonth more than forty battles. and because i have lost the very
 matter of le chevaier du chariot, i depart from the tale of sir launcelot,
 and here i go unto the morte of king arthur; and that caused sir
 agravaine.
explicit liber xix. and hereafter followeth the most piteous history of
 the morte of king arthur, the which is the twentieth book.
 chapter i. how sir agravaine and sir mordred were busy upon sir gawaine
 for to disclose the love between sir launcelot and queen guenever
 in may when every lusty heart flourisheth and bourgeoneth, for as the
 season is lusty to behold and comfortable, so man and woman rejoice and
 gladden of summer coming with his fresh flowers: for winter with his rough
 winds and blasts causeth a lusty man and woman to cower and sit fast by
 the fire. so in this season, as in the month of may, it befell a great
 anger and unhap that stinted not till the flower of chivalry of all the
 world was destroyed and slain; and all was long upon two unhappy knights
 the which were named agravaine and sir mordred, that were brethren unto
 sir gawaine. for this sir agravaine and sir mordred had ever a privy hate
 unto the queen dame guenever and to sir launcelot, and daily and nightly
 they ever watched upon sir launcelot.
 so it mishapped, sir gawaine and all his brethren were in king arthur's
 chamber; and then sir agravaine said thus openly, and not in no counsel,
 that many knights might hear it: i marvel that we all be not ashamed both
 to see and to know how sir launcelot lieth daily and nightly by the queen,
 and all we know it so; and it is shamefully suffered of us all, that we
 all should suffer so noble a king as king arthur is so to be shamed.
 then spake sir gawaine, and said: brother sir agravaine, i pray you and
 charge you move no such matters no more afore me, for wit you well, said
 sir gawaine, i will not be of your counsel. so god me help, said sir
 gaheris and sir gareth, we will not be knowing, brother agravaine, of your
 deeds. then will i, said sir mordred. i lieve well that, said sir gawaine,
 for ever unto all unhappiness, brother sir mordred, thereto will ye grant;
 and i would that ye left all this, and made you not so busy, for i know,
 said sir gawaine, what will fall of it. fall of it what fall may, said sir
 agravaine, i will disclose it to the king. not by my counsel, said sir
 gawaine, for an there rise war and wrack betwixt sir launcelot and us, wit
 you well brother, there will many kings and great lords hold with sir
 launcelot. also, brother sir agravaine, said sir gawaine, ye must remember
 how ofttimes sir launcelot hath rescued the king and the queen; and the
 best of us all had been full cold at the heart-root had not sir launcelot
 been better than we, and that hath he proved himself full oft. and as for
 my part, said sir gawaine, i will never be against sir launcelot for one
 day's deed, when he rescued me from king carados of the dolorous tower,
 and slew him, and saved my life. also, brother sir agravaine and sir
 mordred, in like wise sir launcelot rescued you both, and threescore and
 two, from sir turquin. methinketh brother, such kind deeds and kindness
 should be remembered. do as ye list, said sir agravaine, for i will lain
 it no longer. with these words came to them king arthur. now brother,
 stint your noise, said sir gawaine. we will not, said sir agravaine and
 sir mordred. will ye so? said sir gawaine; then god speed you, for i will
 not hear your tales ne be of your counsel. no more will i, said sir gareth
 and sir gaheris, for we will never say evil by that man; for because, said
 sir gareth, sir launcelot made me knight, by no manner owe i to say ill of
 him: and therewithal they three departed, making great dole. alas, said
 sir gawaine and sir gareth, now is this realm wholly mischieved, and the
 noble fellowship of the round table shall be disparpled: so they departed.
 chapter ii. how sir agravaine disclosed their love to king arthur, and how
 king arthur gave them licence to take him
 and then sir arthur asked them what noise they made. my lord, said
 agravaine, i shall tell you that i may keep no longer. here is i, and my
 brother sir mordred, brake unto my brothers sir gawaine, sir gaheris, and
 to sir gareth, how this we know all, that sir launcelot holdeth your
 queen, and hath done long; and we be your sister's sons, and we may suffer
 it no longer, and all we wot that ye should be above sir launcelot; and ye
 are the king that made him knight, and therefore we will prove it, that he
 is a traitor to your person.
 if it be so, said sir arthur, wit you well he is none other, but i would
 be loath to begin such a thing but i might have proofs upon it; for sir
 launcelot is an hardy knight, and all ye know he is the best knight among
 us all; and but if he be taken with the deed, he will fight with him that
 bringeth up the noise, and i know no knight that is able to match him.
 therefore an it be sooth as ye say, i would he were taken with the deed.
 for as the french book saith, the king was full loath thereto, that any
 noise should be upon sir launcelot and his queen; for the king had a
 deeming, but he would not hear of it, for sir launcelot had done so much
 for him and the queen so many times, that wit ye well the king loved him
 passingly well. my lord, said sir agravaine, ye shall ride to-morn
 a-hunting, and doubt ye not sir launcelot will not go with you. then when
 it draweth toward night, ye may send the queen word that ye will lie out
 all that night, and so may ye send for your cooks, and then upon pain of
 death we shall take him that night with the queen, and outher we shall
 bring him to you dead or quick. i will well, said the king; then i counsel
 you, said the king, take with you sure fellowship. sir, said agravaine, my
 brother, sir mordred, and i, will take with us twelve knights of the round
 table. beware, said king arthur, for i warn you ye shall find him wight.
 let us deal, said sir agravaine and sir mordred.
 so on the morn king arthur rode a-hunting, and sent word to the queen that
 he would be out all that night. then sir agravaine and sir mordred gat to
 them twelve knights, and hid themself in a chamber in the castle of
 carlisle, and these were their names: sir colgrevance, sir mador de la
 porte, sir gingaline, sir meliot de logris, sir petipase of winchelsea,
 sir galleron of galway, sir melion of the mountain, sir astamore, sir
 gromore somir joure, sir curselaine, sir florence, sir lovel. so these
 twelve knights were with sir mordred and sir agravaine, and all they were
 of scotland, outher of sir gawaine's kin, either well-willers to his
 brethren.
 so when the night came, sir launcelot told sir bors how he would go that
 night and speak with the queen. sir, said sir bors, ye shall not go this
 night by my counsel. why? said sir launcelot. sir, said sir bors, i dread
 me ever of sir agravaine, that waiteth you daily to do you shame and us
 all; and never gave my heart against no going, that ever ye went to the
 queen, so much as now; for i mistrust that the king is out this night from
 the queen because peradventure he hath lain some watch for you and the
 queen, and therefore i dread me sore of treason. have ye no dread, said
 sir launcelot, for i shall go and come again, and make no tarrying. sir,
 said sir bors, that me repenteth, for i dread me sore that your going out
 this night shall wrath us all. fair nephew, said sir launcelot, i marvel
 much why ye say thus, sithen the queen hath sent for me; and wit ye well i
 will not be so much a coward, but she shall understand i will see her good
 grace. god speed you well, said sir bors, and send you sound and safe
 again.
 chapter iii. how sir launcelot was espied in the queen's chamber, and how
 sir agravaine and sir mordred came with twelve knights to slay him
 so sir launcelot departed, and took his sword under his arm, and so in his
 mantle that noble knight put himself in great jeopardy; and so he passed
 till he came to the queen's chamber, and then sir launcelot was lightly
 put into the chamber. and then, as the french book saith, the queen and
 launcelot were together. and whether they were abed or at other manner of
 disports, me list not hereof make no mention, for love that time was not
 as is now-a-days. but thus as they were together, there came sir agravaine
 and sir mordred, with twelve knights with them of the round table, and
 they said with crying voice: traitor-knight, sir launcelot du lake, now
 art thou taken. and thus they cried with a loud voice, that all the court
 might hear it; and they all fourteen were armed at all points as they
 should fight in a battle. alas said queen guenever, now are we mischieved
 both madam, said sir launcelot, is there here any armour within your
 chamber, that i might cover my poor body withal? an if there be any give
 it me, and i shall soon stint their malice, by the grace of god. truly,
 said the queen, i have none armour, shield, sword, nor spear; wherefore i
 dread me sore our long love is come to a mischievous end, for i hear by
 their noise there be many noble knights, and well i wot they be surely
 armed, and against them ye may make no resistance. wherefore ye are likely
 to be slain, and then shall i be brent. for an ye might escape them, said
 the queen, i would not doubt but that ye would rescue me in what danger
 that ever i stood in. alas, said sir launcelot, in all my life thus was i
 never bestead, that i should be thus shamefully slain for lack of mine
 armour.
 but ever in one sir agravaine and sir mordred cried: traitor-knight, come
 out of the queen's chamber, for wit thou well thou art so beset that thou
 shalt not escape. o jesu mercy, said sir launcelot, this shameful cry and
 noise i may not suffer, for better were death at once than thus to endure
 this pain. then he took the queen in his arms, and kissed her, and said:
 most noble christian queen, i beseech you as ye have been ever my special
 good lady, and i at all times your true poor knight unto my power, and as
 i never failed you in right nor in wrong sithen the first day king arthur
 made me knight, that ye will pray for my soul if that i here be slain; for
 well i am assured that sir bors, my nephew, and all the remnant of my kin,
 with sir lavaine and sir urre, that they will not fail you to rescue you
 from the fire; and therefore, mine own lady, recomfort yourself,
 whatsomever come of me, that ye go with sir bors, my nephew, and sir urre,
 and they all will do you all the pleasure that they can or may, that ye
 shall live like a queen upon my lands. nay, launcelot, said the queen, wit
 thou well i will never live after thy days, but an thou be slain i will
 take my death as meekly for jesu christ's sake as ever did any christian
 queen. well, madam, said i-auncelot, sith it is so that the day is come
 that our love must depart, wit you well i shall sell my life as dear as i
 may; and a thousandfold, said sir launcelot, i am more heavier for you
 than for myself. and now i had liefer than to be lord of all christendom,
 that i had sure armour upon me, that men might speak of my deeds or ever i
 were slain. truly, said the queen, i would an it might please god that
 they would take me and slay me, and suffer you to escape. that shall never
 be, said sir launcelot, god defend me from such a shame, but jesu be thou
 my shield and mine armour!
 chapter iv. how sir launcelot slew sir colgrevance, and armed him in his
 harness, and after slew sir agravaine, and twelve of his fellows
 and therewith sir launcelot wrapped his mantle about his arm well and
 surely; and by then they had gotten a great form out of the hall, and
 therewithal they rashed at the door. fair lords, said sir launcelot, leave
 your noise and your rashing, and i shall set open this door, and then may
 ye do with me what it liketh you. come off then, said they all, and do it,
 for it availeth thee not to strive against us all; and therefore let us
 into this chamber, and we shall save thy life until thou come to king
 arthur. then launcelot unbarred the door, and with his left hand he held
 it open a little, so that but one man might come in at once; and so there
 came striding a good knight, a much man and large, and his name was
 colgrevance of gore, and he with a sword struck at sir launcelot mightily;
 and he put aside the stroke, and gave him such a buffet upon the helmet,
 that he fell grovelling dead within the chamber door. and then sir
 launcelot with great might drew that dead knight within the chamber door;
 and sir launcelot with help of the queen and her ladies was lightly armed
 in sir colgrevance's armour.
 and ever stood sir agravaine and sir mordred crying: traitor-knight, come
 out of the queen's chamber. leave your noise, said sir launcelot unto sir
 agravaine, for wit you well, sir agravaine, ye shall not prison me this
 night; and therefore an ye do by my counsel, go ye all from this chamber
 door, and make not such crying and such manner of slander as ye do; for i
 promise you by my knighthood, an ye will depart and make no more noise, i
 shall as to-morn appear afore you all before the king, and then let it be
 seen which of you all, outher else ye all, that will accuse me of treason;
 and there i shall answer you as a knight should, that hither i came to the
 queen for no manner of mal engin, and that will i prove and make it good
 upon you with my hands. fie on thee, traitor, said sir agravaine and sir
 mordred, we will have thee maugre thy head, and slay thee if we list; for
 we let thee wit we have the choice of king arthur to save thee or to slay
 thee. ah sirs, said sir launcelot, is there none other grace with you?
 then keep yourself.
 so then sir launcelot set all open the chamber door, and mightily and
 knightly he strode in amongst them; and anon at the first buffet he slew
 sir agravaine. and twelve of his fellows after, within a little while
 after, he laid them cold to the earth, for there was none of the twelve
 that might stand sir launcelot one buffet. also sir launcelot wounded sir
 mordred, and he fled with all his might. and then sir launcelot returned
 again unto the queen, and said: madam, now wit you well all our true love
 is brought to an end, for now will king arthur ever be my foe; and
 therefore, madam, an it like you that i may have you with me, i shall save
 you from all manner adventures dangerous. that is not best, said the
 queen; meseemeth now ye have done so much harm, it will be best ye hold
 you still with this. and if ye see that as to-morn they will put me unto
 the death, then may ye rescue me as ye think best. i will well, said sir
 launcelot, for have ye no doubt, while i am living i shall rescue you. and
 then he kissed her, and either gave other a ring; and so there he left the
 queen, and went until his lodging.
 chapter v. how sir launcelot came to sir bors, and told him how he had
 sped, and in what adventure he had been, and how he had escaped
 when sir bors saw sir launcelot he was never so glad of his home-coming as
 he was then. jesu mercy, said sir launcelot, why be ye all armed: what
 meaneth this? sir, said sir bors, after ye were departed from us, we all
 that be of your blood and your well-willers were so dretched that some of
 us leapt out of our beds naked, and some in their dreams caught naked
 swords in their hands; therefore, said sir bors, we deem there is some
 great strife at hand; and then we all deemed that ye were betrapped with
 some treason, and therefore we made us thus ready, what need that ever ye
 were in.
 my fair nephew, said sir launcelot unto sir bors, now shall ye wit all,
 that this night i was more harder bestead than ever i was in my life, and
 yet i escaped. and so he told them all how and in what manner, as ye have
 heard to-fore. and therefore, my fellows, said sir launcelot, i pray you
 all that ye will be of good heart in what need somever i stand, for now is
 war come to us all. sir, said bors, all is welcome that god sendeth us,
 and we have had much weal with you and much worship, and therefore we will
 take the woe with you as we have taken the weal. and therefore, they said
 all (there were many good knights), look ye take no discomfort, for there
 nis no bands of knights under heaven but we shall be able to grieve them
 as much as they may us. and therefore discomfort not yourself by no
 manner, and we shall gather together that we love, and that loveth us, and
 what that ye will have done shall be done. and therefore, sir launcelot,
 said they, we will take the woe with the weal. grant mercy, said sir
 launcelot, of your good comfort, for in my great distress, my fair nephew,
 ye comfort me greatly, and much i am beholding unto you. but this, my fair
 nephew, i would that ye did in all haste that ye may, or it be forth days,
 that ye will look in their lodging that be lodged here nigh about the
 king, which will hold with me, and which will not, for now i would know
 which were my friends from my foes. sir, said sir bors, i shall do my
 pain, and or it be seven of the clock i shall wit of such as ye have said
 before, who will hold with you.
 then sir bors called unto him sir lionel, sir ector de maris, sir blamore
 de ganis, sir bleoberis de ganis, sir gahalantine, sir galihodin, sir
 galihud, sir menadeuke sir villiers the valiant, sir hebes le renoumes,
 sir lavaine sir urre of hungary, sir nerounes, sir plenorius. these two
 knights sir launcelot made, and the one he won upon a bridge, and
 therefore they would never be against him. and harry le fise du lake, and
 sir selises of the dolorous tower, and sir melias de lile, and sir
 bellangere le beuse, that was sir alisander's son le orphelin, because his
 mother alice le beale pellerin and she was kin unto sir launcelot, and he
 held with him. so there came sir palomides and sir safere, his brother, to
 hold with sir launcelot, and sir clegis of sadok, and sir dinas, sir
 clarius of cleremont. so these two-and-twenty knights drew them together,
 and by then they were armed on horseback, and promised sir launcelot to do
 what he would. then there fell to them, what of north wales and of
 cornwall, for sir lamorak's sake and for sir tristram's sake, to the
 number of a fourscore knights.
 my lords, said sir launcelot, wit you well, i have been ever since i came
 into this country well willed unto my lord, king arthur, and unto my lady,
 queen guenever, unto my power; and this night because my lady the queen
 sent for me to speak with her, i suppose it was made by treason, howbeit i
 dare largely excuse her person, notwithstanding i was there by a forecast
 near slain, but as jesu provided me i escaped all their malice and
 treason. and then that noble knight sir launcelot told them all how he was
 hard bestead in the queen's chamber, and how and in what manner he escaped
 from them. and therefore, said sir launcelot, wit you well, my fair lords,
 i am sure there nis but war unto me and mine. and for because i have slain
 this night these knights, i wot well, as is sir agravaine sir gawaine's
 brother, and at the least twelve of his fellows, for this cause now i am
 sure of mortal war, for these knights were sent and ordained by king
 arthur to betray me. and therefore the king will in his heat and malice
 judge the queen to the fire, and that may i not suffer, that she should be
 brent for my sake; for an i may be heard and suffered and so taken, i will
 fight for the queen, that she is a true lady unto her lord; but the king
 in his heat i dread me will not take me as i ought to be taken.
 chapter vi. of the counsel and advice that was taken by sir launcelot and
 his friends for to save the queen
 my lord, sir launcelot, said sir bors, by mine advice ye shall take the
 woe with the weal, and take it in patience, and thank god of it. and
 sithen it is fallen as it is, i counsel you keep yourself, for an ye will
 yourself, there is no fellowship of knights christened that shall do you
 wrong. also i will counsel you my lord, sir launcelot, than an my lady,
 queen guenever, be in distress, insomuch as she is in pain for your sake,
 that ye knightly rescue her; an ye did otherwise, all the world will speak
 of you shame to the world's end. insomuch as ye were taken with her,
 whether ye did right or wrong, it is now your part to hold with the queen,
 that she be not slain and put to a mischievous death, for an she so die
 the shame shall be yours. jesu defend me from shame, said sir launcelot,
 and keep and save my lady the queen from villainy and shameful death, and
 that she never be destroyed in my default; wherefore my fair lords, my
 kin, and my friends, said sir launcelot, what will ye do? then they said
 all: we will do as ye will do. i put this to you, said sir launcelot, that
 if my lord arthur by evil counsel will to-morn in his heat put my lady the
 queen to the fire there to be brent, now i pray you counsel me what is
 best to do. then they said all at once with one voice: sir, us thinketh
 best that ye knightly rescue the queen, insomuch as she shall be brent it
 is for your sake; and it is to suppose, an ye might be handled, ye should
 have the same death, or a more shamefuler death. and sir, we say all, that
 ye have many times rescued her from death for other men's quarrels, us
 seemeth it is more your worship that ye rescue the queen from this peril,
 insomuch she hath it for your sake.
 then sir launcelot stood still, and said: my fair lords, wit you well i
 would be loath to do that thing that should dishonour you or my blood, and
 wit you well i would be loath that my lady, the queen, should die a
 shameful death; but an it be so that ye will counsel me to rescue her, i
 must do much harm or i rescue her; and peradventure i shall there destroy
 some of my best friends, that should much repent me; and peradventure
 there be some, an they could well bring it about, or disobey my lord king
 arthur, they would soon come to me, the which i were loath to hurt. and if
 so be that i rescue her, where shall i keep her? that shall be the least
 care of us all, said sir bors. how did the noble knight sir tristram, by
 your good will? kept not he with him la beale isoud near three year in
 joyous gard? the which was done by your alther device, and that same place
 is your own; and in likewise may ye do an ye list, and take the queen
 lightly away, if it so be the king will judge her to be brent; and in
 joyous gard ye may keep her long enough until the heat of the king be
 past. and then shall ye bring again the queen to the king with great
 worship; and then peradventure ye shall have thank for her bringing home,
 and love and thank where other shall have maugre.
 that is hard to do, said sir launcelot, for by sir tristram i may have a
 warning, for when by means of treaties, sir tristram brought again la
 beale isoud unto king mark from joyous gard, look what befell on the end,
 how shamefully that false traitor king mark slew him as he sat harping
 afore his lady la beale isoud, with a grounden glaive he thrust him in
 behind to the heart. it grieveth me, said sir launcelot, to speak of his
 death, for all the world may not find such a knight. all this is truth,
 said sir bors, but there is one thing shall courage you and us all, ye
 know well king arthur and king mark were never like of conditions, for
 there was never yet man could prove king arthur untrue of his promise.
 so to make short tale, they were all consented that for better outher for
 worse, if so were that the queen were on that morn brought to the fire,
 shortly they all would rescue her. and so by the advice of sir launcelot,
 they put them all in an embushment in a wood, as nigh carlisle as they
 might, and there they abode still, to wit what the king would do.
 chapter vii. how sir mordred rode hastily to the king, to tell him of the
 affray and death of sir agravaine and the other knights
 now turn we again unto sir mordred, that when he was escaped from the
 noble knight, sir launcelot, he anon gat his horse and mounted upon him,
 and rode unto king arthur, sore wounded and smitten, and all forbled; and
 there he told the king all how it was, and how they were all slain save
 himself all only. jesu mercy, how may this be? said the king; took ye him
 in the queen's chamber? yea, so god me help, said sir mordred, there we
 found him unarmed, and there he slew colgrevance, and armed him in his
 armour; and all this he told the king from the beginning to the ending.
 jesu mercy, said the king, he is a marvellous knight of prowess. alas, me
 sore repenteth, said the king, that ever sir launcelot should be against
 me. now i am sure the noble fellowship of the round table is broken for
 ever, for with him will many a noble knight hold; and now it is fallen so,
 said the king, that i may not with my worship, but the queen must suffer
 the death. so then there was made great ordinance in this heat, that the
 queen must be judged to the death. and the law was such in those days that
 whatsomever they were, of what estate or degree, if they were found guilty
 of treason, there should be none other remedy but death; and outher the
 men or the taking with the deed should be causer of their hasty judgment.
 and right so was it ordained for queen guenever, because sir mordred was
 escaped sore wounded, and the death of thirteen knights of the round
 table. these proofs and experiences caused king arthur to command the
 queen to the fire there to be brent.
 then spake sir gawaine, and said: my lord arthur, i would counsel you not
 to be over-hasty, but that ye would put it in respite, this judgment of my
 lady the queen, for many causes. one it is, though it were so that sir
 launcelot were found in the queen's chamber, yet it might be so that he
 came thither for none evil; for ye know my lord, said sir gawaine, that
 the queen is much beholden unto sir launcelot, more than unto any other
 knight, for ofttimes he hath saved her life, and done battle for her when
 all the court refused the queen; and peradventure she sent for him for
 goodness and for none evil, to reward him for his good deeds that he had
 done to her in times past. and peradventure my lady, the queen, sent for
 him to that intent that sir launcelot should come to her good grace
 privily and secretly, weening to her that it was best so to do, in
 eschewing and dreading of slander; for ofttimes we do many things that we
 ween it be for the best, and yet peradventure it turneth to the worst. for
 i dare say, said sir gawaine, my lady, your queen, is to you both good and
 true; and as for sir launcelot, said sir gawaine, i dare say he will make
 it good upon any knight living that will put upon himself villainy or
 shame, and in like wise he will make good for my lady, dame guenever.
 that i believe well, said king arthur, but i will not that way with sir
 launcelot, for he trusteth so much upon his hands and his might that he
 doubteth no man; and therefore for my queen he shall never fight more, for
 she shall have the law. and if i may get sir launcelot, wit you well he
 shall have a shameful death. jesu defend, said sir gawaine, that i may
 never see it. why say ye so? said king arthur; forsooth ye have no cause
 to love sir launcelot, for this night last past he slew your brother, sir
 agravaine, a full good knight, and almost he had slain your other brother,
 sir mordred, and also there he slew thirteen noble knights; and also, sir
 gawaine, remember you he slew two sons of yours, sir florence and sir
 lovel. my lord, said sir gawaine, of all this i have knowledge, of whose
 deaths i repent me sore; but insomuch i gave them warning, and told my
 brethren and my sons aforehand what would fall in the end, insomuch they
 would not do by my counsel, i will not meddle me thereof, nor revenge me
 nothing of their deaths; for i told them it was no boot to strive with sir
 launcelot. howbeit i am sorry of the death of my brethren and of my sons,
 for they are the causers of their own death; for ofttimes i warned my
 brother sir agravaine, and i told him the perils the which be now fallen.
 chapter viii. how sir launcelot and his kinsmen rescued the queen from the
 fire, and how he slew many knights
 then said the noble king arthur to sir gawaine: dear nephew, i pray you
 make you ready in your best armour, with your brethren, sir gaheris and
 sir gareth, to bring my queen to the fire, there to have her judgment and
 receive the death. nay, my most noble lord, said sir gawaine, that will i
 never do; for wit you well i will never be in that place where so noble a
 queen as is my lady, dame guenever, shall take a shameful end. for wit you
 well, said sir gawaine, my heart will never serve me to see her die; and
 it shall never be said that ever i was of your counsel of her death.
 then said the king to sir gawaine: suffer your brothers sir gaheris and
 sir gareth to be there. my lord, said sir gawaine, wit you well they will
 be loath to be there present, because of many adventures the which be like
 there to fall, but they are young and full unable to say you nay. then
 spake sir gaheris, and the good knight sir gareth, unto sir arthur: sir,
 ye may well command us to be there, but wit you well it shall be sore
 against our will; but an we be there by your strait commandment ye shall
 plainly hold us there excused: we will be there in peaceable wise, and
 bear none harness of war upon us. in the name of god, said the king, then
 make you ready, for she shall soon have her judgment anon. alas, said sir
 gawaine, that ever i should endure to see this woful day. so sir gawaine
 turned him and wept heartily, and so he went into his chamber; and then
 the queen was led forth without carlisle, and there she was despoiled into
 her smock. and so then her ghostly father was brought to her, to be
 shriven of her misdeeds. then was there weeping, and wailing, and wringing
 of hands, of many lords and ladies, but there were but few in comparison
 that would bear any armour for to strength the death of the queen.
 then was there one that sir launcelot had sent unto that place for to espy
 what time the queen should go unto her death; and anon as he saw the queen
 despoiled into her smock, and so shriven, then he gave sir launcelot
 warning. then was there but spurring and plucking up of horses, and right
 so they came to the fire. and who that stood against them, there were they
 slain; there might none withstand sir launcelot, so all that bare arms and
 withstood them, there were they slain, full many a noble knight. for there
 was slain sir belliance le orgulous, sir segwarides, sir griflet, sir
 brandiles, sir aglovale, sir tor; sir gauter, sir gillimer, sir reynolds'
 three brethren; sir damas, sir priamus, sir kay the stranger, sir driant,
 sir lambegus, sir herminde; sir pertilope, sir perimones, two brethren
 that were called the green knight and the red knight. and so in this
 rushing and hurling, as sir launcelot thrang here and there, it mishapped
 him to slay gaheris and sir gareth, the noble knight, for they were
 unarmed and unware. for as the french book saith, sir launcelot smote sir
 gareth and sir gaheris upon the brain-pans, wherethrough they were slain
 in the field; howbeit in very truth sir launcelot saw them not, and so
 were they found dead among the thickest of the press.
 then when sir launcelot had thus done, and slain and put to flight all
 that would withstand him, then he rode straight unto dame guenever, and
 made a kirtle and a gown to be cast upon her; and then he made her to be
 set behind him, and prayed her to be of good cheer. wit you well the queen
 was glad that she was escaped from the death. and then she thanked god and
 sir launcelot; and so he rode his way with the queen, as the french book
 saith, unto joyous gard, and there he kept her as a noble knight should
 do; and many great lords and some kings sent sir launcelot many good
 knights, and many noble knights drew unto sir launcelot. when this was
 known openly, that king arthur and sir launcelot were at debate, many
 knights were glad of their debate, and many were full heavy of their
 debate.
 chapter ix. of the sorrow and lamentation of king arthur for the death of
 his nephews and other good knights, and also for the queen, his wife
 so turn we again unto king arthur, that when it was told him how and in
 what manner of wise the queen was taken away from the fire, and when he
 heard of the death of his noble knights, and in especial of sir gaheris
 and sir gareth's death, then the king swooned for pure sorrow. and when he
 awoke of his swoon, then he said: alas, that ever i bare crown upon my
 head! for now have i lost the fairest fellowship of noble knights that
 ever held christian king together. alas, my good knights be slain away
 from me: now within these two days i have lost forty knights, and also the
 noble fellowship of sir launcelot and his blood, for now i may never hold
 them together no more with my worship. alas that ever this war began. now
 fair fellows, said the king, i charge you that no man tell sir gawaine of
 the death of his two brethren; for i am sure, said the king, when sir
 gawaine heareth tell that sir gareth is dead he will go nigh out of his
 mind. mercy jesu, said the king, why slew he sir gareth and sir gaheris,
 for i dare say as for sir gareth he loved sir launcelot above all men
 earthly. that is truth, said some knights, but they were slain in the
 hurtling as sir launcelot thrang in the thick of the press; and as they
 were unarmed he smote them and wist not whom that he smote, and so
 unhappily they were slain. the death of them, said arthur, will cause the
 greatest mortal war that ever was; i am sure, wist sir gawaine that sir
 gareth were slain, i should never have rest of him till i had destroyed
 sir launcelot's kin and himself both, outher else he to destroy me. and
 therefore, said the king, wit you well my heart was never so heavy as it
 is now, and much more i am sorrier for my good knights' loss than for the
 loss of my fair queen; for queens i might have enow, but such a fellowship
 of good knights shall never be together in no company. and now i dare say,
 said king arthur, there was never christian king held such a fellowship
 together; and alas that ever sir launcelot and i should be at debate. ah
 agravaine, agravaine, said the king, jesu forgive it thy soul, for thine
 evil will, that thou and thy brother sir mordred hadst unto sir launcelot,
 hath caused all this sorrow: and ever among these complaints the king wept
 and swooned.
 then there came one unto sir gawaine, and told him how the queen was led
 away with sir launcelot, and nigh a twenty-four knights slain. o jesu
 defend my brethren, said sir gawaine, for full well wist i that sir
 launcelot would rescue her, outher else he would die in that field; and to
 say the truth he had not been a man of worship had he not rescued the
 queen that day, insomuch she should have been brent for his sake. and as
 in that, said sir gawaine, he hath done but knightly, and as i would have
 done myself an i had stood in like case. but where are my brethren? said
 sir gawaine, i marvel i hear not of them. truly, said that man, sir gareth
 and sir gaheris be slain. jesu defend, said sir gawaine, for all the world
 i would not that they were slain, and in especial my good brother, sir
 gareth. sir, said the man, he is slain, and that is great pity. who slew
 him? said sir gawaine. sir, said the man, launcelot slew them both. that
 may i not believe, said sir gawaine, that ever he slew my brother, sir
 gareth; for i dare say my brother gareth loved him better than me, and all
 his brethren, and the king both. also i dare say, an sir launcelot had
 desired my brother sir gareth, with him he would have been with him
 against the king and us all, and therefore i may never believe that sir
 launcelot slew my brother. sir, said this man, it is noised that he slew
 him.
 chapter x. how king arthur at the request of sir gawaine concluded to make
 war against sir launcelot, and laid siege to his castle called joyous gard
 alas, said sir gawaine, now is my joy gone. and then he fell down and
 swooned, and long he lay there as he had been dead. and then, when he
 arose of his swoon, he cried out sorrowfully, and said: alas! and right so
 sir gawaine ran to the king, crying and weeping: o king arthur, mine
 uncle, my good brother sir gareth is slain, and so is my brother sir
 gaheris, the which were two noble knights. then the king wept, and he
 both; and so they fell a-swooning. and when they were revived then spake
 sir gawaine: sir, i will go see my brother, sir gareth. ye may not see
 him, said the king, for i caused him to be interred, and sir gaheris both;
 for i well understood that ye would make over-much sorrow, and the sight
 of sir gareth should have caused your double sorrow. alas, my lord, said
 sir gawaine, how slew he my brother, sir gareth? mine own good lord i pray
 you tell me. truly, said the king, i shall tell you how it is told me, sir
 launcelot slew him and sir gaheris both. alas, said sir gawaine, they bare
 none arms against him, neither of them both. i wot not how it was, said
 the king, but as it is said, sir launcelot slew them both in the thickest
 of the press and knew them not; and therefore let us shape a remedy for to
 revenge their deaths.
 my king, my lord, and mine uncle, said sir gawaine, wit you well now i
 shall make you a promise that i shall hold by my knighthood, that from
 this day i shall never fail sir launcelot until the one of us have slain
 the other. and therefore i require you, my lord and king, dress you to the
 war, for wit you well i will be revenged upon sir launcelot; and
 therefore, as ye will have my service and my love, now haste you thereto,
 and assay your friends. for i promise unto god, said sir gawaine, for the
 death of my brother, sir gareth, i shall seek sir launcelot throughout
 seven kings' realms, but i shall slay him or else he shall slay me. ye
 shall not need to seek him so far, said the king, for as i hear say, sir
 launcelot will abide me and you in the joyous gard; and much people
 draweth unto him, as i hear say. that may i believe, said sir gawaine; but
 my lord, he said, assay your friends, and i will assay mine. it shall be
 done, said the king, and as i suppose i shall be big enough to draw him
 out of the biggest tower of his castle.
 so then the king sent letters and writs throughout all england, both in
 the length and the breadth, for to assummon all his knights. and so unto
 arthur drew many knights, dukes, and earls, so that he had a great host.
 and when they were assembled, the king informed them how sir launcelot had
 bereft him his queen. then the king and all his host made them ready to
 lay siege about sir launcelot, where he lay within joyous gard. thereof
 heard sir launcelot, and purveyed him of many good knights, for with him
 held many knights; and some for his own sake, and some for the queen's
 sake. thus they were on both parties well furnished and garnished of all
 manner of thing that longed to the war. but king arthur's host was so big
 that sir launcelot would not abide him in the field, for he was full loath
 to do battle against the king; but sir launcelot drew him to his strong
 castle with all manner of victual, and as many noble men as he might
 suffice within the town and the castle. then came king arthur with sir
 gawaine with an huge host, and laid a siege all about joyous gard, both at
 the town and at the castle, and there they made strong war on both parties.
 but in no wise sir launcelot would ride out, nor go out of his castle, of
 long time; neither he would none of his good knights to issue out, neither
 none of the town nor of the castle, until fifteen weeks were past.
 chapter xi. of the communication between king arthur and sir launcelot,
 and how king arthur reproved him.
 then it befell upon a day in harvest time, sir launcelot looked over the
 walls, and spake on high unto king arthur and sir gawaine: my lords both,
 wit ye well all is in vain that ye make at this siege, for here win ye no
 worship but maugre and dishonour; for an it list me to come myself out and
 my good knights, i should full soon make an end of this war. come forth,
 said arthur unto launcelot, an thou durst, and i promise thee i shall meet
 thee in midst of the field. god defend me, said sir launcelot, that ever i
 should encounter with the most noble king that made me knight. fie upon
 thy fair language, said the king, for wit you well and trust it, i am thy
 mortal foe, and ever will to my death day; for thou hast slain my good
 knights, and full noble men of my blood, that i shall never recover again.
 also thou hast lain by my queen, and holden her many winters, and sithen
 like a traitor taken her from me by force.
 my most noble lord and king, said sir launcelot, ye may say what ye will,
 for ye wot well with yourself will i not strive; but thereas ye say i have
 slain your good knights, i wot well that i have done so, and that me sore
 repenteth; but i was enforced to do battle with them in saving of my life,
 or else i must have suffered them to have slain me. and as for my lady,
 queen guenever, except your person of your highness, and my lord sir
 gawaine, there is no knight under heaven that dare make it good upon me,
 that ever i was a traitor unto your person. and where it please you to say
 that i have holden my lady your queen years and winters, unto that i shall
 ever make a large answer, and prove it upon any knight that beareth the
 life, except your person and sir gawaine, that my lady, queen guenever, is
 a true lady unto your person as any is living unto her lord, and that will
 i make good with my hands. howbeit it hath liked her good grace to have me
 in chierte, and to cherish me more than any other knight; and unto my
 power i again have deserved her love, for ofttimes, my lord, ye have
 consented that she should be brent and destroyed, in your heat, and then
 it fortuned me to do battle for her, and or i departed from her adversary
 they confessed their untruth, and she full worshipfully excused. and at
 such times, my lord arthur, said sir launcelot, ye loved me, and thanked
 me when i saved your queen from the fire; and then ye promised me for ever
 to be my good lord; and now methinketh ye reward me full ill for my good
 service. and my good lord, meseemeth i had lost a great part of my worship
 in my knighthood an i had suffered my lady, your queen, to have been
 brent, and insomuch she should have been brent for my sake. for sithen i
 have done battles for your queen in other quarrels than in mine own,
 meseemeth now i had more right to do battle for her in right quarrel. and
 therefore my good and gracious lord, said sir launcelot, take your queen
 unto your good grace, for she is both fair, true, and good.
 fie on thee, false recreant knight, said sir gawaine; i let thee wit my
 lord, mine uncle, king arthur, shall have his queen and thee, maugre thy
 visage, and slay you both whether it please him. it may well be, said sir
 launcelot, but wit you well, my lord sir gawaine, an me list to come out
 of this castle ye should win me and the queen more harder than ever ye won
 a strong battle. fie on thy proud words, said sir gawaine; as for my lady,
 the queen, i will never say of her shame. but thou, false and recreant
 knight, said sir gawaine, what cause hadst thou to slay my good brother
 sir gareth, that loved thee more than all my kin? alas thou madest him
 knight thine own hands; why slew thou him that loved thee so well? for to
 excuse me, said sir launcelot, it helpeth me not, but by jesu, and by the
 faith that i owe to the high order of knighthood, i should with as good
 will have slain my nephew, sir bors de ganis, at that time. but alas that
 ever i was so unhappy, said launcelot, that i had not seen sir gareth and
 sir gaheris.
 thou liest, recreant knight, said sir gawaine, thou slewest him in despite
 of me; and therefore, wit thou well i shall make war to thee, and all the
 while that i may live. that me repenteth, said sir launcelot; for well i
 understand it helpeth not to seek none accordment while ye, sir gawaine,
 are so mischievously set. and if ye were not, i would not doubt to have
 the good grace of my lord arthur. i believe it well, false recreant
 knight, said sir gawaine; for thou hast many long days overled me and us
 all, and destroyed many of our good knights. ye say as it pleaseth you,
 said sir launcelot; and yet may it never be said on me, and openly proved,
 that ever i by forecast of treason slew no good knight, as my lord, sir
 gawaine, ye have done; and so did i never, but in my defence that i was
 driven thereto, in saving of my life. ah, false knight, said sir gawaine,
 that thou meanest by sir lamorak: wit thou well i slew him. ye slew him
 not yourself, said sir launcelot; it had been overmuch on hand for you to
 have slain him, for he was one of the best knights christened of his age,
 and it was great pity of his death.
 chapter xii. how the cousins and kinsmen of sir launcelot excited him to
 go out to battle, and how they made them ready
 well, well, said sir gawaine to launcelot, sithen thou enbraidest me of
 sir lamorak, wit thou well i shall never leave thee till i have thee at
 such avail that thou shalt not escape my hands. i trust you well enough,
 said sir launcelot, an ye may get me i get but little mercy. but as the
 french book saith, the noble king arthur would have taken his queen again,
 and have been accorded with sir launcelot, but sir gawaine would not
 suffer him by no manner of mean. and then sir gawaine made many men to
 blow upon sir launcelot; and all at once they called him false recreant
 knight.
 then when sir bors de ganis, sir ector de maris, and sir lionel, heard
 this outcry, they called to them sir palomides, sir safere's brother, and
 sir lavaine, with many more of their blood, and all they went unto sir
 launcelot, and said thus: my lord sir launcelot, wit ye well we have great
 scorn of the great rebukes that we heard gawaine say to you; wherefore we
 pray you, and charge you as ye will have our service, keep us no longer
 within these walls; for wit you well plainly, we will ride into the field
 and do battle with them; for ye fare as a man that were afeard, and for
 all your fair speech it will not avail you. for wit you well sir gawaine
 will not suffer you to be accorded with king arthur, and therefore fight
 for your life and your right, an ye dare. alas, said sir launcelot, for to
 ride out of this castle, and to do battle, i am full loath.
 then sir launcelot spake on high unto sir arthur and sir gawaine: my
 lords, i require you and beseech you, sithen that i am thus required and
 conjured to ride into the field, that neither you, my lord king arthur,
 nor you sir gawaine, come not into the field. what shall we do then? said
 sir gawaine, [n]is this the king's quarrel with thee to fight? and it is
 my quarrel to fight with thee, sir launcelot, because of the death of my
 brother sir gareth. then must i needs unto battle, said sir launcelot. now
 wit you well, my lord arthur and sir gawaine, ye will repent it
 whensomever i do battle with you.
 and so then they departed either from other; and then either party made
 them ready on the morn for to do battle, and great purveyance was made on
 both sides; and sir gawaine let purvey many knights for to wait upon sir
 launcelot, for to overset him and to slay him. and on the morn at underne
 sir arthur was ready in the field with three great hosts. and then sir
 launcelot's fellowship came out at three gates, in a full good array; and
 sir lionel came in the foremost battle, and sir launcelot came in the
 middle, and sir bors came out at the third gate. thus they came in order
 and rule, as full noble knights; and always sir launcelot charged all his
 knights in any wise to save king arthur and sir gawaine.
 chapter xiii. how sir gawaine jousted and smote down sir lionel, and how
 sir launcelot horsed king arthur
 then came forth sir gawaine from the king's host, and he came before and
 proffered to joust. and sir lionel was a fierce knight, and lightly he
 encountered with sir gawaine; and there sir gawaine smote sir lionel
 through out the body, that he dashed to the earth like as he had been
 dead; and then sir ector de maris and other more bare him into the castle.
 then there began a great stour, and much people was slain; and ever sir
 launcelot did what he might to save the people on king arthur's party, for
 sir palomides, and sir bors, and sir safere, overthrew many knights, for
 they were deadly knights. and sir blamore de ganis, and sir bleoberis de
 ganis, with sir bellangere le beuse, these six knights did much harm; and
 ever king arthur was nigh about sir launcelot to have slain him, and sir
 launcelot suffered him, and would not strike again. so sir bors
 encountered with king arthur, and there with a spear sir bors smote him
 down; and so he alighted and drew his sword, and said to sir launcelot:
 shall i make an end of this war? and that he meant to have slain king
 arthur. not so hardy, said sir launcelot, upon pain of thy head, that thou
 touch him no more, for i will never see that most noble king that made me
 knight neither slain ne shamed. and therewithal sir launcelot alighted off
 his horse and took up the king and horsed him again, and said thus: my
 lord arthur, for god's love stint this strife, for ye get here no worship,
 and i would do mine utterance, but always i forbear you, and ye nor none
 of yours forbeareth me; my lord, remember what i have done in many places,
 and now i am evil rewarded.
 then when king arthur was on horseback, he looked upon sir launcelot, and
 then the tears brast out of his eyen, thinking on the great courtesy that
 was in sir launcelot more than in any other man; and therewith the king
 rode his way, and might no longer behold him, and said: alas, that ever
 this war began. and then either parties of the battles withdrew them to
 repose them, and buried the dead, and to the wounded men they laid soft
 salves; and thus they endured that night till on the morn. and on the morn
 by underne they made them ready to do battle. and then sir bors led the
 forward.
 so upon the morn there came sir gawaine as brim as any boar, with a great
 spear in his hand. and when sir bors saw him he thought to revenge his
 brother sir lionel of the despite that sir gawaine did him the other day.
 and so they that knew either other feutred their spears, and with all
 their mights of their horses and themselves, they met together so
 felonously that either bare other through, and so they fell both to the
 earth; and then the battles joined, and there was much slaughter on both
 parties. then sir launcelot rescued sir bors, and sent him into the
 castle; but neither sir gawaine nor sir bors died not of their wounds, for
 they were all holpen. then sir lavaine and sir urre prayed sir launcelot
 to do his pain, and fight as they had done; for we see ye forbear and
 spare, and that doth much harm; therefore we pray you spare not your
 enemies no more than they do you. alas, said sir launcelot, i have no
 heart to fight against my lord arthur, for ever meseemeth i do not as i
 ought to do. my lord, said sir palomides, though ye spare them all this
 day they will never con you thank; and if they may get you at avail ye are
 but dead. so then sir launcelot understood that they said him truth; and
 then he strained himself more than he did aforehand, and because his
 nephew sir bors was sore wounded. and then within a little while, by
 evensong time, sir launcelot and his party better stood, for their horses
 went in blood past the fetlocks, there was so much people slain. and then
 for pity sir launcelot withheld his knights, and suffered king arthur's
 party for to withdraw them aside. and then sir launcelot's party withdrew
 them into his castle, and either parties buried the dead, and put salve
 unto the wounded men.
 so when sir gawaine was hurt, they on king arthur's party were not so
 orgulous as they were toforehand to do battle. of this war was noised
 through all christendom, and at the last it was noised afore the pope; and
 he considering the great goodness of king arthur, and of sir launcelot,
 that was called the most noblest knights of the world, wherefore the pope
 called unto him a noble clerk that at that time was there present; the
 french book saith, it was the bishop of rochester; and the pope gave him
 bulls under lead unto king arthur of england, charging him upon pain of
 interdicting of all england, that he take his queen dame guenever unto him
 again, and accord with sir launcelot.
 chapter xiv. how the pope sent down his bulls to make peace, and how sir
 launcelot brought the queen to king arthur
 so when this bishop was come to carlisle he shewed the king these bulls.
 and when the king understood these bulls he nist what to do: full fain he
 would have been accorded with sir launcelot, but sir gawaine would not
 suffer him; but as for to have the queen, thereto he agreed. but in nowise
 sir gawaine would not suffer the king to accord with sir launcelot; but as
 for the queen he consented. and then the bishop had of the king his great
 seal, and his assurance as he was a true anointed king that sir launcelot
 should come safe, and go safe, and that the queen should not be spoken
 unto of the king, nor of none other, for no thing done afore time past;
 and of all these appointments the bishop brought with him sure assurance
 and writing, to shew sir launcelot.
 so when the bishop was come to joyous gard, there he shewed sir launcelot
 how the pope had written to arthur and unto him, and there he told him the
 perils if he withheld the queen from the king. it was never in my thought,
 said launcelot, to withhold the queen from my lord arthur; but, insomuch
 she should have been dead for my sake, meseemeth it was my part to save
 her life, and put her from that danger, till better recover might come.
 and now i thank god, said sir launcelot, that the pope hath made her
 peace; for god knoweth, said sir launcelot, i will be a thousandfold more
 gladder to bring her again, than ever i was of her taking away; with this,
 i may be sure to come safe and go safe, and that the queen shall have her
 liberty as she had before; and never for no thing that hath been surmised
 afore this time, she never from this day stand in no peril. for else, said
 sir launcelot, i dare adventure me to keep her from an harder shour than
 ever i kept her. it shall not need you, said the bishop, to dread so much;
 for wit you well, the pope must be obeyed, and it were not the pope's
 worship nor my poor honesty to wit you distressed, neither the queen,
 neither in peril, nor shamed. and then he shewed sir launcelot all his
 writing, both from the pope and from king arthur. this is sure enough,
 said sir launcelot, for full well i dare trust my lord's own writing and
 his seal, for he was never shamed of his promise. therefore, said sir
 launcelot unto the bishop, ye shall ride unto the king afore, and
 recommend me unto his good grace, and let him have knowledging that this
 same day eight days, by the grace of god, i myself shall bring my lady,
 queen guenever, unto him. and then say ye unto my most redoubted king,
 that i will say largely for the queen, that i shall none except for dread
 nor fear, but the king himself, and my lord sir gawaine; and that is more
 for the king's love than for himself.
 so the bishop departed and came to the king at carlisle, and told him all
 how sir launcelot answered him; and then the tears brast out of the king's
 eyen. then sir launcelot purveyed him an hundred knights, and all were
 clothed in green velvet, and their horses trapped to their heels; and
 every knight held a branch of olive in his hand, in tokening of peace. and
 the queen had four-and-twenty gentlewomen following her in the same wise;
 and sir launcelot had twelve coursers following him, and on every courser
 sat a young gentleman, and all they were arrayed in green velvet, with
 sarps of gold about their quarters, and the horse trapped in the same wise
 down to the heels, with many ouches, y-set with stones and pearls in gold,
 to the number of a thousand. and she and sir launcelot were clothed in
 white cloth of gold tissue; and right so as ye have heard, as the french
 book maketh mention, he rode with the queen from joyous gard to carlisle.
 and so sir launcelot rode throughout carlisle, and so in the castle, that
 all men might behold; and wit you well there was many a weeping eye. and
 then sir launcelot himself alighted and avoided his horse, and took the
 queen, and so led her where king arthur was in his seat: and sir gawaine
 sat afore him, and many other great lords. so when sir launcelot saw the
 king and sir gawaine, then he led the queen by the arm, and then he
 kneeled down, and the queen both. wit you well then was there many bold
 knight there with king arthur that wept as tenderly as though they had
 seen all their kin afore them. so the king sat still, and said no word.
 and when sir launcelot saw his countenance, he arose and pulled up the
 queen with him, and thus he spake full knightly.
 chapter xv. of the deliverance of the queen to the king by sir launcelot,
 and what language sir gawaine had to sir launcelot
 my most redoubted king, ye shall understand, by the pope's commandment and
 yours, i have brought to you my lady the queen, as right requireth; and if
 there be any knight, of whatsomever degree that he be, except your person,
 that will say or dare say but that she is true and clean to you, i here
 myself, sir launcelot du lake, will make it good upon his body, that she
 is a true lady unto you; but liars ye have listened, and that hath caused
 debate betwixt you and me. for time hath been, my lord arthur, that ye
 have been greatly pleased with me when i did battle for my lady, your
 queen; and full well ye know, my most noble king, that she hath been put
 to great wrong or this time; and sithen it pleased you at many times that
 i should fight for her, meseemeth, my good lord, i had more cause to
 rescue her from the fire, insomuch she should have been brent for my sake.
 for they that told you those tales were liars, and so it fell upon them;
 for by likelihood had not the might of god been with me, i might never
 have endured fourteen knights, and they armed and afore purposed, and i
 unarmed and not purposed. for i was sent for unto my lady your queen, i
 wot not for what cause; but i was not so soon within the chamber door, but
 anon sir agravaine and sir mordred called me traitor and recreant knight.
 they called thee right, said sir gawaine. my lord sir gawaine, said sir
 launcelot, in their quarrel they proved themselves not in the right. well
 well, sir launcelot, said the king, i have given thee no cause to do to me
 as thou hast done, for i have worshipped thee and thine more than any of
 all my knights.
 my good lord, said sir launcelot, so ye be not displeased, ye shall
 understand i and mine have done you oft better service than any other
 knights have done, in many divers places; and where ye have been full hard
 bestead divers times, i have myself rescued you from many dangers; and
 ever unto my power i was glad to please you, and my lord sir gawaine; both
 in jousts, and tournaments, and in battles set, both on horseback and on
 foot, i have often rescued you, and my lord sir gawaine, and many mo of
 your knights in many divers places. for now i will make avaunt, said sir
 launcelot, i will that ye all wit that yet i found never no manner of
 knight but that i was overhard for him, an i had done my utterance,
 thanked be god; howbeit i have been matched with good knights, as sir
 tristram and sir lamorak, but ever i had a favour unto them and a deeming
 what they were. and i take god to record, said sir launcelot, i never was
 wroth nor greatly heavy with no good knight an i saw him busy about to win
 worship; and glad i was ever when i found any knight that might endure me
 on horseback and on foot: howbeit sir carados of the dolorous tower was a
 full noble knight and a passing strong man, and that wot ye, my lord sir
 gawaine; for he might well be called a noble knight when he by fine force
 pulled you out of your saddle, and bound you overthwart afore him to his
 saddle bow; and there, my lord sir gawaine, i rescued you, and slew him
 afore your sight. also i found his brother, sir turquin, in likewise
 leading sir gaheris, your brother, bounden afore him; and there i rescued
 your brother and slew that turquin, and delivered three-score-and-four of
 my lord arthur's knights out of his prison. and now i dare say, said sir
 launcelot, i met never with so strong knights, nor so well fighting, as
 was sir carados and sir turquin, for i fought with them to the uttermost.
 and therefore, said sir launcelot unto sir gawaine, meseemeth ye ought of
 right to remember this; for, an i might have your good will, i would trust
 to god to have my lord arthur's good grace.
 chapter xvi. of the communication between sir gawaine and sir launcelot,
 with much other language
 the king may do as he will, said sir gawaine, but wit thou well, sir
 launcelot, thou and i shall never be accorded while we live, for thou hast
 slain three of my brethren; and two of them ye slew traitorly and
 piteously, for they bare none harness against thee, nor none would bear.
 god would they had been armed, said sir launcelot, for then had they been
 alive. and wit ye well sir gawaine, as for sir gareth, i love none of my
 kinsmen so much as i did him; and ever while i live, said sir launcelot, i
 will bewail sir gareth's death, not all only for the great fear i have of
 you, but many causes cause me to be sorrowful. one is, for i made him
 knight; another is, i wot well he loved me above all other knights; and
 the third is, he was passing noble, true, courteous, and gentle, and well
 conditioned; the fourth is, i wist well, anon as i heard that sir gareth
 was dead, i should never after have your love, but everlasting war betwixt
 us; and also i wist well that ye would cause my noble lord arthur for ever
 to be my mortal foe. and as jesu be my help, said sir launcelot, i slew
 never sir gareth nor sir gaheris by my will; but alas that ever they were
 unarmed that unhappy day. but thus much i shall offer me, said sir
 launcelot, if it may please the king's good grace, and you, my lord sir
 gawaine, i shall first begin at sandwich, and there i shall go in my
 shirt, barefoot; and at every ten miles' end i will found and gar make an
 house of religion, of what order that ye will assign me, with an whole
 convent, to sing and read, day and night, in especial for sir gareth's
 sake and sir gaheris. and this shall i perform from sandwich unto
 carlisle; and every house shall have sufficient livelihood. and this shall
 i perform while i have any livelihood in christendom; and there nis none
 of all these religious places, but they shall be performed, furnished and
 garnished in all things as an holy place ought to be, i promise you
 faithfully. and this, sir gawaine, methinketh were more fairer, holier,
 and more better to their souls, than ye, my most noble king, and you, sir
 gawaine, to war upon me, for thereby shall ye get none avail.
 then all knights and ladies that were there wept as they were mad, and the
 tears fell on king arthur's cheeks. sir launcelot, said sir gawaine, i
 have right well heard thy speech, and thy great proffers, but wit thou
 well, let the king do as it pleased him, i will never forgive my brothers'
 death, and in especial the death of my brother, sir gareth. and if mine
 uncle, king arthur, will accord with thee, he shall lose my service, for
 wit thou well thou art both false to the king and to me. sir, said
 launcelot he beareth not the life that may make that good and if ye, sir
 gawaine, will charge me with so high a thing, ye must pardon me, for then
 needs must i answer you. nay, said sir gawaine, we are past that at this
 time, and that caused the pope, for he hath charged mine uncle, the king,
 that he shall take his queen again, and to accord with thee, sir
 launcelot, as for this season, and therefore thou shalt go safe as thou
 camest. but in this land thou shalt not abide past fifteen days, such
 summons i give thee: so the king and we were consented and accorded or
 thou camest. and else, said sir gawaine, wit thou well thou shouldst not
 have come here, but if it were maugre thy head. and if it were not for the
 pope's commandment, said sir gawaine, i should do battle with mine own
 body against thy body, and prove it upon thee, that thou hast been both
 false unto mine uncle king arthur, and to me both; and that shall i prove
 upon thy body, when thou art departed from hence, wheresomever i find
 thee.
 chapter xvii. how sir launcelot departed from the king and from joyous
 gard over seaward, and what knights went with him
 then sir launcelot sighed, and therewith the tears fell on his cheeks, and
 then he said thus: alas, most noble christian realm, whom i have loved
 above all other realms, and in thee i have gotten a great part of my
 worship, and now i shall depart in this wise. truly me repenteth that ever
 i came in this realm, that should be thus shamefully banished, undeserved
 and causeless; but fortune is so variant, and the wheel so moveable, there
 nis none constant abiding, and that may be proved by many old chronicles,
 of noble ector, and troilus, and alisander, the mighty conqueror, and many
 mo other; when they were most in their royalty, they alighted lowest. and
 so fareth it by me, said sir launcelot, for in this realm i had worship,
 and by me and mine all the whole round table hath been increased more in
 worship, by me and mine blood, than by any other. and therefore wit thou
 well, sir gawaine, i may live upon my lands as well as any knight that
 here is. and if ye, most redoubted king, will come upon my lands with sir
 gawaine to war upon me, i must endure you as well as i may. but as to you,
 sir gawaine, if that ye come there, i pray you charge me not with treason
 nor felony, for an ye do, i must answer you. do thou thy best, said sir
 gawaine; therefore hie thee fast that thou were gone, and wit thou well we
 shall soon come after, and break the strongest castle that thou hast, upon
 thy head. that shall not need, said sir launcelot, for an i were as
 orgulous set as ye are, wit you well i should meet you in midst of the
 field. make thou no more language, said sir gawaine, but deliver the queen
 from thee, and pike thee lightly out of this court. well, said sir
 launcelot, an i had wist of this short coming, i would have advised me
 twice or that i had come hither; for an the queen had been so dear to me
 as ye noise her, i durst have kept her from the fellowship of the best
 knights under heaven.
 and then sir launcelot said unto guenever, in hearing of the king and them
 all: madam, now i must depart from you and this noble fellowship for ever;
 and sithen it is so, i beseech you to pray for me, and say me well; and if
 ye be hard bestead by any false tongues, lightly my lady send me word, and
 if any knight's hands may deliver you by battle, i shall deliver you. and
 therewithal sir launcelot kissed the queen; and then he said all openly.
 now let see what he be in this place that dare say the queen is not true
 unto my lord arthur, let see who will speak an he dare speak. and
 therewith he brought the queen to the king, and then sir launcelot took
 his leave and departed; and there was neither king, duke, nor earl, baron
 nor knight, lady nor gentlewoman, but all they wept as people out of their
 mind, except sir gawaine. and when the noble sir launcelot took his horse
 to ride out of carlisle, there was sobbing and weeping for pure dole of
 his departing; and so he took his way unto joyous gard. and then ever
 after he called it the dolorous gard. and thus departed sir launcelot from
 the court for ever.
 and so when he came to joyous gard he called his fellowship unto him, and
 asked them what they would do then they answered all wholly together with
 one voice they would as he would do. my fair fellows, said sir launcelot,
 i must depart out of this most noble realm, and now i shall depart it
 grieveth me sore, for i shall depart with no worship, for a flemed man
 departed never out of a realm with no worship; and that is my heaviness,
 for ever i fear after my days that men shall chronicle upon me that i was
 flemed out of this land; and else, my fair lords, be ye sure, an i had not
 dread shame, my lady, queen guenever, and i should never have departed.
 then spake many noble knights, as sir palomides, sir safere his brother,
 and sir bellingere le beuse, and sir urre, with sir lavaine, with many
 others: sir, an ye be so disposed to abide in this land we will never fail
 you; and if ye list not to abide in this land there nis none of the good
 knights that here be will fail you, for many causes. one is, all we that
 be not of your blood shall never be welcome to the court. and sithen it
 liked us to take a part with you in your distress and heaviness in this
 realm, wit you well it shall like us as well to go in other countries with
 you, and there to take such part as ye do. my fair lords, said sir
 launcelot, i well understand you, and as i can, thank you: and ye shall
 understand, such livelihood as i am born unto i shall depart with you in
 this manner of wise; that is for to say, i shall depart all my livelihood
 and all my lands freely among you, and i myself will have as little as any
 of you, for have i sufficient that may long to my person, i will ask none
 other rich array; and i trust to god to maintain you on my lands as well
 as ever were maintained any knights. then spake all the knights at once:
 he have shame that will leave you; for we all understand in this realm
 will be now no quiet, but ever strife and debate, now the fellowship of
 the round table is broken; for by the noble fellowship of the round table
 was king arthur upborne, and by their noblesse the king and all his realm
 was in quiet and rest, and a great part they said all was because of your
 noblesse.
 chapter xviii. how sir launcelot passed over the sea, and how he made
 great lords of the knights that went with him
 truly, said sir launcelot, i thank you all of your good saying, howbeit, i
 wot well, in me was not all the stability of this realm, but in that i
 might i did my devoir; and well i am sure i knew many rebellions in my
 days that by me were peaced, and i trow we all shall hear of them in short
 space, and that me sore repenteth. for ever i dread me, said sir
 launcelot, that sir mordred will make trouble, for he is passing envious
 and applieth him to trouble. so they were accorded to go with sir
 launcelot to his lands; and to make short tale, they trussed, and paid all
 that would ask them; and wholly an hundred knights departed with sir
 launcelot at once, and made their avows they would never leave him for
 weal nor for woe.
 and so they shipped at cardiff, and sailed unto benwick: some men call it
 bayonne, and some men call it beaune, where the wine of beaune is. but to
 say the sooth, sir launcelot and his nephews were lords of all france, and
 of all the lands that longed unto france; he and his kindred rejoiced it
 all through sir launcelot's noble prowess. and then sir launcelot stuffed
 and furnished and garnished all his noble towns and castles. then all the
 people of those lands came to sir launcelot on foot and hands. and so when
 he had stablished all these countries, he shortly called a parliament; and
 there he crowned sir lionel, king of france; and sir bors [he] crowned him
 king of all king claudas' lands; and sir ector de maris, that was sir
 launcelot's youngest brother, he crowned him king of benwick, and king of
 all guienne, that was sir launcelot's own land. and he made sir ector
 prince of them all, and thus he departed.
 then sir launcelot advanced all his noble knights, and first he advanced
 them of his blood; that was sir blamore, he made him duke of limosin in
 guienne and sir bleoberis he made him duke of poictiers, and sir
 gahalantine he made him duke of querne, and sir galihodin he made him duke
 of sentonge, and sir galihud he made him earl of perigot, and sir
 menadeuke he made him earl of roerge, and sir villiars the valiant he made
 him earl of bearn, and sir hebes le renoumes he made him earl of comange,
 and sir lavaine he made him earl of arminak, and sir urre he made him earl
 of estrake, and sir neroneus he made him earl of pardiak, and sir
 plenorius he made earl of foise, and sir selises of the dolorous tower he
 made him earl of masauke, and sir melias de lile he made him earl of
 tursauk, and sir bellangere le beuse he made earl of the launds, and sir
 palomides he made him duke of the provence, and sir safere he made him
 duke of landok, and sir clegis he gave him the earldom of agente, and sir
 sadok he gave the earldom of surlat, and sir dinas le seneschal he made
 him duke of anjou, and sir clarrus he made him duke of normandy. thus sir
 launcelot rewarded his noble knights and many more, that meseemeth it were
 too long to rehearse
 chapter xix. how king arthur and sir gawaine made a great host ready to go
 over sea to make war on sir launcelot
 so leave we sir launcelot in his lands, and his noble knights with him,
 and return we again unto king arthur and to sir gawaine, that made a great
 host ready, to the number of threescore thousand; and all thing was made
 ready for their shipping to pass over the sea, and so they shipped at
 cardiff. and there king arthur made sir mordred chief ruler of all
 england, and also he put queen guenever under his governance; because sir
 mordred was king arthur's son, he gave him the rule of his land and of his
 wife; and so the king passed the sea and landed upon sir launcelot's
 lands, and there he brent and wasted, through the vengeance of sir
 gawaine, all that they might overrun.
 when this word came to sir launcelot, that king arthur and sir gawaine
 were landed upon his lands, and made a full great destruction and waste,
 then spake sir bors, and said: my lord sir launcelot, it is shame that we
 suffer them thus to ride over our lands, for wit you well, suffer ye them
 as long as ye will, they will do you no favour an they may handle you.
 then said sir lionel that was wary and wise: my lord sir launcelot, i will
 give this counsel, let us keep our strong walled towns until they have
 hunger and cold, and blow on their nails; and then let us freshly set upon
 them, and shred them down as sheep in a field, that aliens may take
 example for ever how they land upon our lands.
 then spake king bagdemagus to sir launcelot: sir, your courtesy will
 shende us all, and thy courtesy hath waked all this sorrow; for an they
 thus over our lands ride, they shall by process bring us all to nought
 whilst we thus in holes us hide. then said sir galihud unto sir launcelot:
 sir, here be knights come of kings' blood, that will not long droop, and
 they are within these walls; therefore give us leave, like as we be
 knights, to meet them in the field, and we shall slay them, that they
 shall curse the time that ever they came into this country. then spake
 seven brethren of north wales, and they were seven noble knights; a man
 might seek in seven kings' lands or he might find such seven knights. then
 they all said at once: sir launcelot, for christ's sake let us out ride
 with sir galihud, for we be never wont to cower in castles nor in noble
 towns.
 then spake sir launcelot, that was master and governor of them all: my
 fair lords, wit you well i am full loath to ride out with my knights for
 shedding of christian blood; and yet my lands i understand be full bare
 for to sustain any host awhile, for the mighty wars that whilom made king
 claudas upon this country, upon my father king ban, and on mine uncle king
 bors; howbeit we will as at this time keep our strong walls, and i shall
 send a messenger unto my lord arthur, a treaty for to take; for better is
 peace than always war.
 so sir launcelot sent forth a damosel and a dwarf with her, requiring king
 arthur to leave his warring upon his lands; and so she start upon a
 palfrey, and the dwarf ran by her side. and when she came to the pavilion
 of king arthur, there she alighted; and there met her a gentle knight, sir
 lucan the butler, and said: fair damosel, come ye from sir launcelot du
 lake? yea sir, she said, therefore i come hither to speak with my lord the
 king. alas, said sir lucan, my lord arthur would love launcelot, but sir
 gawaine will not suffer him. and then he said: i pray to god, damosel, ye
 may speed well, for all we that be about the king would sir launcelot did
 best of any knight living. and so with this lucan led the damosel unto the
 king where he sat with sir gawaine, for to hear what she would say. so
 when she had told her tale, the water ran out of the king's eyen, and all
 the lords were full glad for to advise the king as to be accorded with sir
 launcelot, save all only sir gawaine, and he said: my lord mine uncle,
 what will ye do? will ye now turn again, now ye are passed thus far upon
 this journey? all the world will speak of your villainy. nay, said arthur,
 wit thou well, sir gawaine, i will do as ye will advise me; and yet
 meseemeth, said arthur, his fair proffers were not good to be refused; but
 sithen i am come so far upon this journey, i will that ye give the damosel
 her answer, for i may not speak to her for pity, for her proffers be so
 large.
 chapter xx. what message sir gawaine sent to sir launcelot; and how king
 arthur laid siege to benwick, and other matters
 then sir gawaine said to the damosel thus: damosel, say ye to sir
 launcelot that it is waste labour now to sue to mine uncle; for tell him,
 an he would have made any labour for peace, he should have made it or this
 time, for tell him now it is too late; and say that i, sir gawaine, so
 send him word, that i promise him by the faith i owe unto god and to
 knighthood, i shall never leave him till he have slain me or i him. so the
 damosel wept and departed, and there were many weeping eyen; and so sir
 lucan brought the damosel to her palfrey, and so she came to sir launcelot
 where he was among all his knights. and when sir launcelot had heard this
 answer, then the tears ran down by his cheeks. and then his noble knights
 strode about him, and said: sir launcelot, wherefore make ye such cheer,
 think what ye are, and what men we are, and let us noble knights match
 them in midst of the field. that may be lightly done, said sir launcelot,
 but i was never so loath to do battle, and therefore i pray you, fair
 sirs, as ye love me, be ruled as i will have you, for i will always flee
 that noble king that made me knight. and when i may no further, i must
 needs defend me, and that will be more worship for me and us all than to
 compare with that noble king whom we have all served. then they held their
 language, and as that night they took their rest.
 and upon the morn early, in the dawning of the day, as knights looked out,
 they saw the city of benwick besieged round about; and fast they began to
 set up ladders, and then they defied them out of the town, and beat them
 from the walls wightly. then came forth sir gawaine well armed upon a
 stiff steed, and he came before the chief gate, with his spear in his
 hand, crying: sir launcelot, where art thou? is there none of you proud
 knights dare break a spear with me? then sir bors made him ready, and came
 forth out of the town, and there sir gawaine encountered with sir bors.
 and at that time he smote sir bors down from his horse, and almost he had
 slain him; and so sir bors was rescued and borne into the town. then came
 forth sir lionel, brother to sir bors, and thought to revenge him; and
 either feutred their spears, and ran together; and there they met
 spitefully, but sir gawaine had such grace that he smote sir lionel down,
 and wounded him there passing sore; and then sir lionel was rescued and
 borne into the town. and this sir gawaine came every day, and he failed
 not but that he smote down one knight or other.
 so thus they endured half a year, and much slaughter was of people on both
 parties. then it befell upon a day, sir gawaine came afore the gates armed
 at all pieces on a noble horse, with a great spear in his hand; and then
 he cried with a loud voice: where art thou now, thou false traitor, sir
 launcelot? why hidest thou thyself within holes and walls like a coward?
 look out now, thou false traitor knight, and here i shall revenge upon thy
 body the death of my three brethren. all this language heard sir launcelot
 every deal; and his kin and his knights drew about him, and all they said
 at once to sir launcelot: sir launcelot, now must ye defend you like a
 knight, or else ye be shamed for ever; for, now ye be called upon treason,
 it is time for you to stir, for ye have slept over-long and suffered
 over-much. so god me help, said sir launcelot, i am right heavy of sir
 gawaine's words, for now he charged me with a great charge; and therefore
 i wot it as well as ye, that i must defend me, or else to be recreant.
 then sir launcelot bade saddle his strongest horse, and bade let fetch his
 arms, and bring all unto the gate of the tower; and then sir launcelot
 spake on high unto king arthur, and said: my lord arthur, and noble king
 that made me knight, wit you well i am right heavy for your sake, that ye
 thus sue upon me; and always i forbare you, for an i would have been
 vengeable, i might have met you in midst of the field, and there to have
 made your boldest knights full tame. and now i have forborne half a year,
 and suffered you and sir gawaine to do what ye would do; and now may i
 endure it no longer, for now must i needs defend myself, insomuch sir
 gawaine hath appealed me of treason; the which is greatly against my will
 that ever i should fight against any of your blood, but now i may not
 forsake it, i am driven thereto as a beast till a bay.
 then sir gawaine said: sir launcelot, an thou durst do battle, leave thy
 babbling and come off, and let us ease our hearts. then sir launcelot
 armed him lightly, and mounted upon his horse, and either of the knights
 gat great spears in their hands, and the host without stood still all
 apart, and the noble knights came out of the city by a great number,
 insomuch that when arthur saw the number of men and knights, he marvelled,
 and said to himself: alas, that ever sir launcelot was against me, for now
 i see he hath forborne me. and so the covenant was made, there should no
 man nigh them, nor deal with them, till the one were dead or yelden.
 chapter xxi. how sir launcelot and sir gawaine did battle together, and
 how sir gawaine was overthrown and hurt
 then sir gawaine and sir launcelot departed a great way asunder, and then
 they came together with all their horses' might as they might run, and
 either smote other in midst of their shields; but the knights were so
 strong, and their spears so big, that their horses might not endure their
 buffets, and so their horses fell to the earth; and then they avoided
 their horses, and dressed their shields afore them. then they stood
 together and gave many sad strokes on divers places of their bodies, that
 the blood brast out on many sides and places. then had sir gawaine such a
 grace and gift that an holy man had given to him, that every day in the
 year, from underne till high noon, his might increased those three hours
 as much as thrice his strength, and that caused sir gawaine to win great
 honour. and for his sake king arthur made an ordinance, that all manner of
 battles for any quarrels that should be done afore king arthur should
 begin at underne; and all was done for sir gawaine's love, that by
 likelihood, if sir gawaine were on the one part, he should have the better
 in battle while his strength endureth three hours; but there were but few
 knights that time living that knew this advantage that sir gawaine had,
 but king arthur all only.
 thus sir launcelot fought with sir gawaine, and when sir launcelot felt
 his might evermore increase, sir launcelot wondered and dread him sore to
 be shamed. for as the french book saith, sir launcelot weened, when he
 felt sir gawaine double his strength, that he had been a fiend and none
 earthly man; wherefore sir launcelot traced and traversed, and covered
 himself with his shield, and kept his might and his braide during three
 hours; and that while sir gawaine gave him many sad brunts, and many sad
 strokes, that all the knights that beheld sir launcelot marvelled how that
 he might endure him; but full little understood they that travail that sir
 launcelot had for to endure him. and then when it was past noon sir
 gawaine had no more but his own might. when sir launcelot felt him so come
 down, then he stretched him up and stood near sir gawaine, and said thus:
 my lord sir gawaine, now i feel ye have done; now my lord sir gawaine, i
 must do my part, for many great and grievous strokes i have endured you
 this day with great pain.
 then sir launcelot doubled his strokes and gave sir gawaine such a buffet
 on the helmet that he fell down on his side, and sir launcelot withdrew
 him from him. why withdrawest thou thee? said sir gawaine; now turn again,
 false traitor knight, and slay me, for an thou leave me thus, when i am
 whole i shall do battle with thee again. i shall endure you, sir, by god's
 grace, but wit thou well, sir gawaine, i will never smite a felled knight.
 and so sir launcelot went into the city; and sir gawaine was borne into
 king arthur's pavilion, and leeches were brought to him, and searched and
 salved with soft ointments. and then sir launcelot said: now have good
 day, my lord the king, for wit you well ye win no worship at these walls;
 and if i would my knights outbring, there should many a man die.
 therefore, my lord arthur, remember you of old kindness; and however i
 fare, jesu be your guide in all places.
 chapter xxii. of the sorrow that king arthur made for the war, and of
 another battle where also sir gawaine had the worse
 alas, said the king, that ever this unhappy war was begun; for ever sir
 launcelot forbeareth me in all places, and in likewise my kin, and that is
 seen well this day by my nephew sir gawaine. then king arthur fell sick
 for sorrow of sir gawaine, that he was so sore hurt, and because of the
 war betwixt him and sir launcelot. so then they on king arthur's part kept
 the siege with little war withoutforth; and they withinforth kept their
 walls, and defended them when need was. thus sir gawaine lay sick three
 weeks in his tents, with all manner of leech-craft that might be had. and
 as soon as sir gawaine might go and ride, he armed him at all points, and
 start upon a courser, and gat a spear in his hand, and so he came riding
 afore the chief gate of benwick; and there he cried on height: where art
 thou, sir launcelot? come forth, thou false traitor knight and recreant,
 for i am here, sir gawaine, will prove this that i say on thee.
 all this language sir launcelot heard, and then he said thus: sir gawaine,
 me repents of your foul saying, that ye will not cease of your language;
 for you wot well, sir gawaine, i know your might and all that ye may do;
 and well ye wot, sir gawaine, ye may not greatly hurt me. come down,
 traitor knight, said he, and make it good the contrary with thy hands, for
 it mishapped me the last battle to be hurt of thy hands; therefore wit
 thou well i am come this day to make amends, for i ween this day to lay
 thee as low as thou laidest me. jesu defend me, said sir launcelot, that
 ever i be so far in your danger as ye have been in mine, for then my days
 were done. but sir gawaine, said sir launcelot, ye shall not think that i
 tarry long, but sithen that ye so unknightly call me of treason, ye shall
 have both your hands full of me. and then sir launcelot armed him at all
 points, and mounted upon his horse, and gat a great spear in his hand, and
 rode out at the gate. and both the hosts were assembled, of them without
 and of them within, and stood in array full manly. and both parties were
 charged to hold them still, to see and behold the battle of these two
 noble knights. and then they laid their spears in their rests, and they
 came together as thunder, and sir gawaine brake his spear upon sir
 launcelot in a hundred pieces unto his hand; and sir launcelot smote him
 with a greater might, that sir gawaine's horse's feet raised, and so the
 horse and he fell to the earth. then sir gawaine deliverly avoided his
 horse, and put his shield afore him, and eagerly drew his sword, and bade
 sir launcelot: alight, traitor knight, for if this mare's son hath failed
 me, wit thou well a king's son and a queen's son shall not fail thee.
 then sir launcelot avoided his horse, and dressed his shield afore him,
 and drew his sword; and so stood they together and gave many sad strokes,
 that all men on both parties had thereof passing great wonder. but when
 sir launcelot felt sir gawaine's might so marvellously increase, he then
 withheld his courage and his wind, and kept himself wonder covert of his
 might; and under his shield he traced and traversed here and there, to
 break sir gawaine's strokes and his courage; and sir gawaine enforced
 himself with all his might and power to destroy sir launcelot; for as the
 french book saith, ever as sir gawaine's might increased, right so
 increased his wind and his evil will. thus sir gawaine did great pain unto
 sir launcelot three hours, that he had right great pain for to defend him.
 and when the three hours were passed, that sir launcelot felt that sir
 gawaine was come to his own proper strength, then sir launcelot said unto
 sir gawaine: now have i proved you twice, that ye are a full dangerous
 knight, and a wonderful man of your might; and many wonderful deeds have
 ye done in your days, for by your might increasing you have deceived many
 a full noble and valiant knight; and, now i feel that ye have done your
 mighty deeds, now wit you well i must do my deeds. and then sir launcelot
 stood near sir gawaine, and then sir launcelot doubled his strokes; and
 sir gawaine defended him mightily, but nevertheless sir launcelot smote
 such a stroke upon sir gawaine's helm, and upon the old wound, that sir
 gawaine sinked down upon his one side in a swoon. and anon as he did awake
 he waved and foined at sir launcelot as he lay, and said: traitor knight,
 wit thou well i am not yet slain, come thou near me and perform this
 battle unto the uttermost. i will no more do than i have done, said sir
 launcelot, for when i see you on foot i will do battle upon you all the
 while i see you stand on your feet; but for to smite a wounded man that
 may not stand, god defend me from such a shame. and then he turned him and
 went his way toward the city. and sir gawaine evermore calling him traitor
 knight, and said: wit thou well sir launcelot, when i am whole i shall do
 battle with thee again, for i shall never leave thee till that one of us
 be slain. thus as this siege endured, and as sir gawaine lay sick near a
 month; and when he was well recovered and ready within three days to do
 battle again with sir launcelot, right so came tidings unto arthur from
 england that made king arthur and all his host to remove.
here followeth the xxi. book.
 chapter i. how sir mordred presumed and took on him to be king of england,
 and would have married the queen, his father's wife
 as sir mordred was ruler of all england, he did do make letters as though
 that they came from beyond the sea, and the letters specified that king
 arthur was slain in battle with sir launcelot. wherefore sir mordred made
 a parliament, and called the lords together, and there he made them to
 choose him king; and so was he crowned at canterbury, and held a feast
 there fifteen days; and afterward he drew him unto winchester, and there
 he took the queen guenever, and said plainly that he would wed her which
 was his uncle's wife and his father's wife. and so he made ready for the
 feast, and a day prefixed that they should be wedded; wherefore queen
 guenever was passing heavy. but she durst not discover her heart, but
 spake fair, and agreed to sir mordred's will. then she desired of sir
 mordred for to go to london, to buy all manner of things that longed unto
 the wedding. and because of her fair speech sir mordred trusted her well
 enough, and gave her leave to go. and so when she came to london she took
 the tower of london, and suddenly in all haste possible she stuffed it
 with all manner of victual, and well garnished it with men, and so kept
 it.
 then when sir mordred wist and understood how he was beguiled, he was
 passing wroth out of measure. and a short tale for to make, he went and
 laid a mighty siege about the tower of london, and made many great
 assaults thereat, and threw many great engines unto them, and shot great
 guns. but all might not prevail sir mordred, for queen guenever would
 never for fair speech nor for foul, would never trust to come in his hands
 again.
 then came the bishop of canterbury, the which was a noble clerk and an
 holy man, and thus he said to sir mordred: sir, what will ye do? will ye
 first displease god and sithen shame yourself, and all knighthood? is not
 king arthur your uncle, no farther but your mother's brother, and on her
 himself king arthur begat you upon his own sister, therefore how may you
 wed your father's wife? sir, said the noble clerk, leave this opinion or i
 shall curse you with book and bell and candle. do thou thy worst, said sir
 mordred, wit thou well i shall defy thee. sir, said the bishop, and wit
 you well i shall not fear me to do that me ought to do. also where ye
 noise where my lord arthur is slain, and that is not so, and therefore ye
 will make a foul work in this land. peace, thou false priest, said sir
 mordred, for an thou chafe me any more i shall make strike off thy head.
 so the bishop departed and did the cursing in the most orgulist wise that
 might be done. and then sir mordred sought the bishop of canterbury, for
 to have slain him. then the bishop fled, and took part of his goods with
 him, and went nigh unto glastonbury; and there he was as priest hermit in
 a chapel, and lived in poverty and in holy prayers, for well he understood
 that mischievous war was at hand.
 then sir mordred sought on queen guenever by letters and sonds, and by
 fair means and foul means, for to have her to come out of the tower of
 london; but all this availed not, for she answered him shortly, openly and
 privily, that she had liefer slay herself than to be married with him.
 then came word to sir mordred that king arthur had araised the siege for
 sir launcelot, and he was coming homeward with a great host, to be avenged
 upon sir mordred; wherefore sir mordred made write writs to all the barony
 of this land, and much people drew to him. for then was the common voice
 among them that with arthur was none other life but war and strife, and
 with sir mordred was great joy and bliss. thus was sir arthur depraved,
 and evil said of. and many there were that king arthur had made up of
 nought, and given them lands, might not then say him a good word. lo ye
 all englishmen, see ye not what a mischief here was! for he that was the
 most king and knight of the world, and most loved the fellowship of noble
 knights, and by him they were all upholden, now might not these englishmen
 hold them content with him. lo thus was the old custom and usage of this
 land; and also men say that we of this land have not yet lost nor
 forgotten that custom and usage. alas, this is a great default of us
 englishmen, for there may no thing please us no term. and so fared the
 people at that time, they were better pleased with sir mordred than they
 were with king arthur; and much people drew unto sir mordred, and said
 they would abide with him for better and for worse. and so sir mordred
 drew with a great host to dover, for there he heard say that sir arthur
 would arrive, and so he thought to beat his own father from his lands; and
 the most part of all england held with sir mordred, the people were so
 new-fangle.
 chapter ii. how after that king arthur had tidings, he returned and came
 to dover, where sir mordred met him to let his landing; and of the death
 of
 sir gawaine
 and so as sir mordred was at dover with his host, there came king arthur
 with a great navy of ships, and galleys, and carracks. and there was sir
 mordred ready awaiting upon his landing, to let his own father to land
 upon the land that he was king over. then there was launching of great
 boats and small, and full of noble men of arms; and there was much
 slaughter of gentle knights, and many a full bold baron was laid full low,
 on both parties. but king arthur was so courageous that there might no
 manner of knights let him to land, and his knights fiercely followed him;
 and so they landed maugre sir mordred and all his power, and put sir
 mordred aback, that he fled and all his people.
 so when this battle was done, king arthur let bury his people that were
 dead. and then was noble sir gawaine found in a great boat, lying more
 than half dead when sir arthur wist that sir gawaine was laid so low; he
 went unto him; and there the king made sorrow out of measure, and took sir
 gawaine in his arms, and thrice he there swooned. and then when he awaked,
 he said: alas, sir gawaine, my sister's son, here now thou liest; the man
 in the world that i loved most; and now is my joy gone, for now, my nephew
 sir gawaine, i will discover me unto your person: in sir launcelot and you
 i most had my joy, and mine affiance, and now have i lost my joy of you
 both; wherefore all mine earthly joy is gone from me. mine uncle king
 arthur, said sir gawaine, wit you well my death-day is come, and all is
 through mine own hastiness and wilfulness; for i am smitten upon the old
 wound the which sir launcelot gave me, on the which i feel well i must
 die; and had sir launcelot been with you as he was, this unhappy war had
 never begun; and of all this am i causer, for sir launcelot and his blood,
 through their prowess, held all your cankered enemies in subjection and
 daunger. and now, said sir gawaine, ye shall miss sir launcelot. but alas,
 i would not accord with him, and therefore, said sir gawaine, i pray you,
 fair uncle, that i may have paper, pen, and ink, that i may write to sir
 launcelot a cedle with mine own hands.
 and then when paper and ink was brought, then gawaine was set up weakly by
 king arthur, for he was shriven a little to-fore; and then he wrote thus,
 as the french book maketh mention: unto sir launcelot, flower of all noble
 knights that ever i heard of or saw by my days, i, sir gawaine, king lot's
 son of orkney, sister's son unto the noble king arthur, send thee
 greeting, and let thee have knowledge that the tenth day of may i was
 smitten upon the old wound that thou gavest me afore the city of benwick,
 and through the same wound that thou gavest me i am come to my death-day.
 and i will that all the world wit, that i, sir gawaine, knight of the
 table round, sought my death, and not through thy deserving, but it was
 mine own seeking; wherefore i beseech thee, sir launcelot, to return again
 unto this realm, and see my tomb, and pray some prayer more or less for my
 soul. and this same day that i wrote this cedle, i was hurt to the death
 in the same wound, the which i had of thy hand, sir launcelot; for of a
 more nobler man might i not be slain. also sir launcelot, for all the love
 that ever was betwixt us, make no tarrying, but come over the sea in all
 haste, that thou mayst with thy noble knights rescue that noble king that
 made thee knight, that is my lord arthur; for he is full straitly bestead
 with a false traitor, that is my half-brother, sir mordred; and he hath
 let crown him king, and would have wedded my lady queen guenever, and so
 had he done had she not put herself in the tower of london. and so the
 tenth day of may last past, my lord arthur and we all landed upon them at
 dover; and there we put that false traitor, sir mordred, to flight, and
 there it misfortuned me to be stricken upon thy stroke. and at the date of
 this letter was written, but two hours and a half afore my death, written
 with mine own hand, and so subscribed with part of my heart's blood. and i
 require thee, most famous knight of the world, that thou wilt see my tomb.
 and then sir gawaine wept, and king arthur wept; and then they swooned
 both. and when they awaked both, the king made sir gawaine to receive his
 saviour. and then sir gawaine prayed the king for to send for sir
 launcelot, and to cherish him above all other knights.
 and so at the hour of noon sir gawaine yielded up the spirit; and then the
 king let inter him in a chapel within dover castle; and there yet all men
 may see the skull of him, and the same wound is seen that sir launcelot
 gave him in battle. then was it told the king that sir mordred had pight a
 new field upon barham down. and upon the morn the king rode thither to
 him, and there was a great battle betwixt them, and much people was slain
 on both parties; but at the last sir arthur's party stood best, and sir
 mordred and his party fled unto canterbury.
 chapter iii. how after, sir gawaine's ghost appeared to king arthur, and
 warned him that he should not fight that day
 and then the king let search all the towns for his knights that were
 slain, and interred them; and salved them with soft salves that so sore
 were wounded. then much people drew unto king arthur. and then they said
 that sir mordred warred upon king arthur with wrong. and then king arthur
 drew him with his host down by the seaside, westward toward salisbury; and
 there was a day assigned betwixt king arthur and sir mordred, that they
 should meet upon a down beside salisbury, and not far from the seaside;
