an unfortunate change in your abode.
adultery.[]

temper and spite overwhelm her at the least provocation.
if it is with her husband's friend, she will be unjustly ignored
by her husband. her rights will be cruelly trampled upon by him.
if she thinks she is enticing a youth into this act, she will be
in danger of desertion and divorced for her open intriguing.
for a young woman this implies abasement and low desires,
in which she will find strange adventures afford her pleasure.
[] it is always good to dream that you have successfully resisted
any temptation. to yield, is bad. if a man chooses low ideals, vampirish
influences will swarm around him ready to help him in his nefarious designs.

principle within him, and will be exempt from lascivious dreams.

[] the old dream books give this as a sign of coming prosperity.
this definition is untrue. there are two forces at work in man, one from
within and the other from without. they are from two distinct spheres;
the animal mind influenced by the personal world of carnal appetites,
and the spiritual mind from the realm of universal brotherhood,
present antagonistic motives on the dream consciousness. if these two
forces were in harmony, the spirit or mental picture from the dream
mind would find a literal fulfilment in the life of the dreamer.
the pleasurable sensations of the body cause the spirit anguish.
the selfish enrichment of the body impoverishes the spirit influence upon
the soul. the trials of adversity often cause the spirit to rejoice
and the flesh to weep. if the cry of the grieved spirit is left
on the dream mind it may indicate to the dreamer worldly advancement,
but it is hardly the theory of the occult forces, which have contributed
to the contents of this book.

the voice of relatives is only that higher self taking form to approach
more distinctly the mind that lives near the material plane.
there is so little congeniality between common or material natures
that persons should depend upon their own subjectivity for true
contentment and pleasure.
[] paracelsus says on this subject: ``it may happen that the soul of
persons who have died perhaps fifty years ago may appear to us in a dream,
and if it speaks to us we should pay special attention to what it says,
for such a vision is not an illusion or delusion, and it is possible
that a man is as much able to use his reason during the sleep of his body
as when the latter is awake; and if in such a case such a soul appears
to him and he asks questions, he will then hear that which is true.
through these solicitous souls we may obtain a great deal of knowledge
to good or to evil things if we ask them to reveal them to us.
many persons have had such prayers granted to them. some people that were
sick have been informed during their sleep what remedies they should use,
and after using the remedies, they became cured, and such things have
happened not only to christians, but also to jews, persians, and heathens,
to good and to bad persons.''
the writer does not hold that such knowledge is obtained from external
or excarnate spirits, but rather through the personal spirit glimpses
that is in man.—author.
death.[]
to dream of seeing any of your people dead, warns you of coming dissolution
or sorrow. disappointments always follow dreams of this nature.
to hear of any friend or relative being dead, you will soon have bad news
from some of them.
dreams relating to death or dying, unless they are due
to spiritual causes, are misleading and very confusing to
the novice in dream lore when he attempts to interpret them.
a man who thinks intensely fills his aura with thought or
subjective images active with the passions that gave them birth;
by thinking and acting on other lines, he may supplant these
images with others possessed of a different form and nature.
in his dreams he may see these images dying, dead or
their burial, and mistake them for friends or enemies.
in this way he may, while asleep, see himself or a relative die,
when in reality he has been warned that some good thought
or deed is to be supplanted by an evil one. to illustrate:
if it is a dear friend or relative whom he sees in the agony
of death, he is warned against immoral or other improper thought
and action, but if it is an enemy or some repulsive object
dismantled in death, he may overcome his evil ways and thus give
himself or friends cause for joy. often the end or beginning
of suspense or trials are foretold by dreams of this nature.
they also frequently occur when the dreamer is controlled by imaginary
states of evil or good. a man in that state is not himself,
but is what the dominating influences make him. he may be warned
of approaching conditions or his extrication from the same.
in our dreams we are closer to our real self than in waking life.
the hideous or pleasing incidents seen and heard about us in our
dreams are all of our own making, they reflect the true state
of our soul and body, and we cannot flee from them unless we drive
them out of our being by the use of good thoughts and deeds,
by the power of the spirit within us.
