. a latin primitive, or root, is a latin word from
 which a certain number of english derivative words is formed. thus the
 latin verb du'cere, to draw or lead, is a latin primitive or root,
 and from it are formed educe, education, deduction,
 ductile, reproductive, and several hundred other english
 words.
. latin roots consist chiefly of verbs, nouns, and
 adjectives.
. english derivatives from latin words are generally formed
 not from the root itself but from a part of the root called the
 radical. thus, in the word "education," the root-word is
 ducere, but the radical is duc- (education = e +
 duc + ate + ion).
. a radical is a word or a part of a word used in
 forming english derivatives.
. sometimes several radicals from the same root-word are used,
 the different radicals being taken from different grammatical forms of
 the root-word.
. verb-radicals are formed principally from two parts of the
 verb,—the first person singular of the present indicative, and a
 part called the supine, which is a verbal noun corresponding to
 the english infinitive in -ing. thus:—
st pers. sing. pres. ind.
root
derivative
supine
root
derivative
duco (i draw)
duc-
educe
ductum (drawing, or to draw)
duct-
ductile
i. in giving a latin verb-primitive in this book three "principal
 parts" of the verb will be given, namely: () the present infinitive, ()
 the first person singular of the present indicative, and () the
 supine—the second and the third parts because from them radicals
 are obtained, and the infinitive because this is the part used in naming
 a verb in a general way. thus as we say that loved, loving,
 etc., are parts of the verb "to love," so we say that a'mo
 (present ind.) and ama'tum (supine) are parts of the verb
 ama're.
ii. it should be noted that it is incorrect to translate amo,
 amatum, by "to love," since neither of these words is in the
 infinitive mood, which is amare. the indication of the latin
 infinitive will be found of great utility, as it is the part by which a
 latin verb is referred to in the dictionary.
. noun-radicals and adjective radicals are formed from
 the nominative and from the genitive (or possessive) case of words
 belonging to these parts of speech. thus:—
iter (a journey)
itineris (of a journey)
felicis (nom. felix, happy)
iter-.
itiner-
felic-
reiterate
itinerant
felicity
note.—these explanations of the mode of forming
 radicals are given by way of general information; but this book
 presupposes and requires no knowledge of latin, since in every group of
 english derivatives from latin, not only the root-words in their several
 parts, but the radicals actually used in word-formation, are
 given.
pronunciation of latin words.
. every word in latin must have as many syllables as it has vowels or
 diphthongs: as miles (= mi'les).
. c is pronounced like k before a, o,
 u; and like s before e, i, y, and the
 diphthongs æ and œ: as cado, pronounced
 ka'do; cedo, pronounced se'do.
. g is pronounced hard before a, o, u,
 and soft like j before e, i, y, æ,
 œ: as gusto, in which g is pronounced as in
 august; gero, pronounced je'ro.
. a consonant between two vowels must be joined to the latter: as
 bene, pronounced be'ne.
. two consonants in the middle of a word must be divided: as
 mille, pronounced mil'le.
. the diphthongs æ and œ are sounded like
 e: as cædo, pronounced ce'do.
. words of two syllables are accented on the first: as ager,
 pronounced a'jer.
. when a word of more than one syllable ends in a, the
 a should be sounded like ah: as musa, pronounced
 mu'sah.
. t, s, and c, before ia, ie,
 ii, io, iu, and eu, preceded immediately by
 the accent, in latin words as in english, change into sh and
 zh: as fa'cio, pronounced fa'sheo; san'cio,
 pronounced san'sheo; spa'tium, pronounced
 spa'sheum.
note.—according to the roman method of pronouncing
 latin, the vowels a, e, i, o, u are
 pronounced as in baa, bait, beet, boat,
 boot; ae, au, ei, oe as in
 aisle, our, eight, oil; c always like
 k; g as in get; j as y in yes;
 t as in until; v as w. see any latin
 grammar.
. ag'ere: a'go, ac'tum, to do, to drive.
radicals: ag- and act-.

 the termination um. definition: to do, to perform. the noun

 perform.

the pronunciation of anglo-saxon is much nearer to that of modern
 german or the continental pronunciation of latin than of modern
 english.
the letters of the alphabet wanting in anglo-saxon are: j,
 k, q, v, and z. k is commonly
 represented by c; thus, cyning (king) is pronounced
 kining; cyrtel, kirtle; qu is represented by
 cw, as cwic, quick; cwen, queen;
 cwellan, to quell; th is represented by two peculiar
 characters, one of which in its reduced form resembles y, as in
 ye olden times, where ye should be pronounced the,
 and not ye, as is often ignorantly done.
long vowels should be carefully distinguished from short vowels. long
 vowels are a as far, ae as in fare, e
 as in they, i as in pique, o as in
 bone, u as in rule, y as in i
 (nearly). short vowels are a as in fast, ae as in
 man, e as in men, i as in pin,
 o as in god, u as in full, y as in
 i (nearly).
in the diphthongs ea, eo, and ie, the first
 element receives the stress; the second is pronounced very lightly.
there are no silent letters in anglo-saxon as in modern english. the
 vowel of every syllable is pronounced, and in difficult combinations of
 consonants, as in hlud, loud, cniht, knight, cnif,
 knife, each consonant has its distinct sound.
e before a and o has the sound of y as a
 consonant; i before e and u has the same sound:
 thus, earl = yarl; eow = you; iett =
 yett; and iúgoth = yúgoth, youth.

 that after one month fought alfred king against all the army with a
 little band at wilton, and them long during the day routed and then the
 danes obtained of the battle-field possession. and this year were nine
 great battles fought with the army in the kingdom to the south of the
 thames, besides those in which alfred, and the alder-men, and the king's

sweet is the breath of morn, her rising sweet,
with charm of earliest birds; pleasant the sun
when first on this delightful land he spreads
his orient beams on herb, tree, fruit, and flower,
glistering with dew; fragrant the fertile earth,
after soft showers; and sweet the coming on
of grateful evening mild; then silent night
with this her solemn bird, and this fair moon,
and these the gems of heaven, her starry train.
to be, or not to be, that is the question;
whether 't is nobler in the mind to suffer
the stings and arrows of outrageous fortune,
or to take arms against a sea of troubles,
and, by opposing, end them? to die, to sleep;
no more;—and by a sleep to say we end
the heartache and the thousand natural shocks
that flesh is heir to! 't were a consummation
devoutly to be wished. to die; to sleep;
to sleep?—perchance to dream!
all the world's a stage,
and all the men and women merely players.
they have their exits and their entrances,
and one man in his time plays many parts;
his acts being seven ages. at first the infant,
mewling and puking in his nurse's arms.
and then the whining school-boy, with his satchel
and shining morning face, creeping like snail
unwillingly to school. and then the lover,
sighing like furnace, with a woeful ballad
made to his mistress' eyebrow. then a soldier,
full of strange oaths, and bearded like the pard,
jealous in honour, sudden and quick in quarrel;
seeking the bubble reputation
even in the cannon's mouth.
in the beginning god created the heaven and the earth. and the
 earth was without form, and void; and darkness was upon the
 face of the deep: and the spirit of god moved upon
 the face of the waters. and god said, let there be light; and
 there was light. and god saw the light, that it was good; and god
 divided the light from the darkness. and god called the light day,
 and the darkness he called night. and the evening and the morning were
 the first day.—genesis i. -.
and it came to pass, that when isaac was old, and his
 eyes were dim, so that he could not see, he called esau, his
 eldest son, and said unto him, my son. and he said unto him, behold, here
 am i. and he said, behold now, i am old, i know not the day of my death.
 now therefore take, i pray thee, thy weapons, thy quiver
 and thy bow, and go out to the field, and take me some venison;
 and make me savoury meat, such as i love, and bring it to me, that
 i may eat; that my soul may bless thee before i die. and rebekah
 heard when isaac spake to esau his son. and esau
 went to the field to hunt for venison, and to bring it. and
 rebekah spake unto jacob her son, saying, behold, i heard
 thy father speak unto esau thy brother, saying, bring me
 venison, and make me savoury meat, that i may eat, and
 bless thee before the lord before my death.—genesis xxvii.
these as they change, almighty father! these
are but the varied god. the rolling year
is full of thee. forth in the pleasing spring
thy beauty walks, thy tenderness and love.
wide flush the fields; the softening air is balm;
echo the mountains round; the forest smiles;
and every sense and every heart is joy.
then comes thy glory in the summer months,
with light and heat refulgent. then thy sun
shoots full perfection through the swelling year.
i was yesterday, about sunset, walking in the open fields, till the
 night insensibly fell upon me. i at first amused myself

 appeared in the western parts of heaven. in
 proportion as they faded away and went out, several
 stars and planets appeared, one after another, till the whole
 firmament was in a glow. the blueness of the ether was
 exceedingly heightened and enlivened by the season of the
 year.
let indians, and the gay, like indians, fond
of feathered fopperies, the sun adore:
darkness has more divinity for me;
it strikes thought inward; it drives back the soul
to settle on herself, our point supreme.
there lies our theater: there sits our judge.
darkness the curtain drops o'er life's dull scene:
't is the kind hand of providence stretched out
'twixt man and vanity; 't is reason's reign,
and virtue's too; these tutelary shades
are man's asylum from the tainted throng.
night is the good man's friend, and guardian too.
it no less rescues virtue, than inspires.
wisdom is a fox, who, after long hunting, will at last cost you
 the pains to dig out. 't is a cheese, which by how much the richer
 has the thicker, homelier, and the coarser coat; and whereof, to a
 judicious palate, the maggots are the best. 'tis a sack
 posset, wherein the deeper you go on you will find it sweeter. but
 then, lastly, 'tis a nut, which, unless you choose with judgment,
 may cost you a tooth, and pay you with nothing but a
 worm.
the beauties of her person and graces of her
 air combined to make her the most amiable of women; and the
 charms of her address and conversation aided the
 impression which her lovely figure made on the heart of all
 beholders. ambitious and active in her temper, yet
 inclined to cheerfulness and society; of a lofty
 spirit, constant and even vehement in her
 purpose, yet politic, gentle, and affable, in her
 demeanor, she seemed to partake only so much of the
 male virtues as to render her estimable, without
 relinquishing those soft graces which compose the
 proper ornament of her sex.
in the second century of the christian era, the
 empire of rome comprehended the fairest part of the
 earth, and the most civilized portion of mankind. the
 frontiers of that extensive monarchy were guarded by
 ancient renown, and disciplined valour. the gentle
 but powerful influence of laws and manners had gradually
 cemented the union of the provinces. their peaceful
 inhabitants enjoyed and abused the advantages of wealth
 and luxury. the image of a free constitution was
 preserved with decent reverence.
of genius, that power which constitutes a
 poet; that quality without which judgment is cold,
 and knowledge is inert; that energy which collects,
 combines, amplifies, and animates; the
 superiority must, with some hesitation, be allowed
 to dryden. it is not to be inferred that of this poetical vigor
 pope had only a little, because dryden had more; for every
 other writer since milton must give place to pope; and even
 of dryden it must be said, that if he has brighter paragraphs, he
 has not better poems.
ancient of days! august athena! where,
where are thy men of might—thy grand in soul?
gone—glimmering through the dream of things that were.
first in the race that led to glory's goal,
they won, and passed away. is this the whole?
a school-boy's tale—the wonder of an hour!
the warrior's-weapon and the sophist's stole
are sought in vain, and o'er each mouldering tower,
dim with the mist of years, gray flits the shade of power.

when full of play and childish cares,
what power is in his wildest scream,

my son, if thou be humbled, poor,
hopeless of honor and of gain,
oh! do not dread thy mother's door;
think not of me with grief and pain.
i now can see with better eyes;
and worldly grandeur i despise,
and fortune with her gifts and lies.
not wholly in the busy world, nor quite
beyond it, blooms the garden that i love.
news from the humming city comes to it
in sound of funeral or of marriage bells;
and sitting muffled in dark leaves you hear
the windy clanging of the winter clock;
although between it and the garden lies
a league of grass, washed by a slow broad stream,
that, stirred with languid pulses of the oar,
waves all its lazy lilies, and creeps on,
barge laden, to three arches of a bridge,
crowned with the minster-towers.
