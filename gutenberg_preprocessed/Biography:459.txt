when he mos' through he'd throw a ear of corn to dis one, an' give
himse'f a ear; den he break a ear in two, an' he take part an' give dem
part. dat was close measurin', i tell you.
"us lived in de third house frum de big house in de quarter, an' when i
was a boy it was my job to set out shade trees. an' one day de ku klux
come ridin' by an' dey leader was mister steve renfroe. (alabama bandit
of reconstruction days). he wore long hair an' he call my pappy out an'
ax him a heap of questions. while he sittin' dere his horse pull up nigh
'bout all de trees i done sot out.
"atter talkin' to my pappy, he rode on 'cross horn's bridge, 'bout two
miles souf of here, an' dere he met ol' man enoch sledge an' frank
sledge. dey was darkies whut b'longed to marsa simmy sledge's father,
ol' doctor sledge. slaves on dat plantation was 'lowed pretty good
privilege atter de s'rrender an' was workin' on halvens. uncle enoch an'
frank was in town tradin' some, an' mr. renfroe didn't want 'em to have
anything. when dey lef' town, dey pass de ku kluxes raght on de slough
bridge. mister renfroe ax enoch to give him a piece of string to fix his
saddle wid; den shot him. frank run to de river, but de ku kluxes
cotched him an' shot him, too.
"de niggers went down to de river dat night an' got de bodies an' buried
'em in de ol' travis graveyard. my mammy an' daddy is buried dere, too.
"didn' nobody do nothin' 'bout mister renfroe 'till he went on an' got
to messin' wid marsa simmy sledge's things; stole a pair of mules an' de
white folks rambled atter him 'till dey foun' him in linden. dey got so
hot atter him dat he went to his camp in de flat woods down on bear
creek. dem was skeery times, 'case dat man never had no mercy for
nobody.
"dey's a cave down by de burial grounds whut de slaves dug when dey run
away, an' mister renfroe stayed dere. it's on de river bank an' its dug
up. you digs an' starts low an' pushes de dirt out an' digs up an' makes
a big room up so de water won't git you. i knows whar dey's two of de
caves on de place; my cow fell in one yestidy.
"when ol' marster amos travis come out here from californy, he taken a
lakin' to me an' wanted me to leave t'other side of de place an' move
down dis side of de big house to take keer of dis swamp an' look atter
de han's. but i wanted a big house wid four rooms an' two brick
chimneys, an' i had to talk five years to git it. i's got some
rosebushes now dat was at de big house raght atter de s'rrender, an'
dey's growin' in my yard now.
"speakin' 'bout graveyard, i was passin' dere one night, ridin' on 'bout
midnight, an' sumpin' come draggin' a chain by me lak a dog. i got down
off'n my horse, but couldn't see nothin' wid no chain, so i got back on
de horse an' dere raght in front of me was a jack-me-lantern wid de
brightes' light you ever seed. it was tryin' to lead me off, an' ev'y
time i'd git back in de road it would lead me off ag'in. you sho' will
git los' if you follow a jack-me-lantern.
"one of dem led a man down to de creek by dem double bridges; said he
foun' he was travelin' in de wrong direction, gittin' frum home stidder
clo'ster, so he jes' sit down under a tree an' waited 'til daylight. i
ain't skeered of nothin' but dem jack-me-lanterns, but dey stirs you up
in yo' min' till you can't tell whar you's at; an' dey's so bright dey
nigh 'bout puts yo' eyes out. dey is plenty of 'em over by de graveyard
raght over yonder whar all my white folks is buried, an' mammy an'
pappy, too. dey's all dere 'cept marsa jess travis; he was de nex' whut
come in line for de place, an' he was de bes' frein' dis here nigger
ever had.
"fac' was, dat's whut he call me; 't was 'nigger'. he an' mistus mag
lived raght dere in de big house; den dey move into town an' dat's whar
he died. me an' marsa jess made a 'greement an' he said if he was de
longes' liver, he'd see me buried, an' if i be de longes' liver, i see
him buried. so dat day i went to his office in de co'thouse an' he say
he want to talk wid me. he say, 'you 'members us 'greement?' an' i say,
'whut 'greement, marsa jess?' an' he say, 'bout buryin'.' den i say,
sho', 'i 'members dat.'
"den he got up an' give me some papers 'bout some lan', an' i say, 'whut

jes' goin' outta business.' den i say, 'goodbye, marse jess,' an' he
say, 'goodbye, nigger,' an' i walked on 'crost de street. den mr.
killian say, 'oliver, whut's happened over at de co'thouse?' an i say,
'ain't nothin' as i knows of.' den he say, 'yes, dey is; jes' look at de
peoples gwine in a hurry.' den i turn 'roun' an' run back an' dere lay
marse jess. mr. smith was gettin' him up an' marse jess say to me,
'well, nigger, i didn't do whut i tended to; i missed it.' an' i say,
'boss, fer god's sake go to de hospital; i'll go wid you an' stay wid

'if i had a-wanted to live i wouldn't of shot myself.' he res' a minit,

nelson birdsong
personal interview with nelson and virginia birdsong
summerville, on front street
—ila b. prine, mobile, alabama
nelson birdsong, who lives on front street in the old suburb of
summerville, about three miles from mobile, alabama, was born
a slave. a tall dark negro man, with white hair and whiskers,
he says he was born at montgomery hill, alabama in baldwin
county, and that his people and he were owned by mr. tom adkins.
nelson said he was very small at the time of the surrender, and could
not tell very much about slavery days. in fact, he adds, "you know,
missie, old folks in dem days did'nt 'low chillun to stan' 'roun' when
dey was talking. we chillun was lack a shot out of a gun when anybody
come in. we was glad when folks come in 'cause we c'ud run out an' play.
chillun now-a-days knows as much as we did when we was twenty-five years
old."
nelson does remember his "massa" saying he neber was going to 'let dat
little nigger work.'
he did not remember much about coming to mobile, but "seemed lack" his
"mammy worked for mrs. dunn on monroe street, and later dey moved out in
old napoleonville" (which is now crichton, alabama, a suburb of
mobile). he said his "pa and mammy den worked fo' gris' mill out dere,
and also owned a big gris' mill in de fork whar de big fire station is
now" (which is located at the intersection of st. francis street and
washington avenue, the latter formerly wilkinson street). this grist
mill was burned in the 's.
nelson says the first work he remembered doing was "nussing a baby boy
of mr. bramwell burden, a gran'son of old man burden."
nelson has owned his little farm and three-room house until the past two
or three years. he said he scuffled and tried to pay de taxes, but had
got so old and his "knees had give out on him, and i seed i was agoin'
to lose mah place so i turned it over to a man to keep up mah taxes, so
i'd have a place to lib. de relief gibes me a little he'p now, an' me
an' my wife makes out de bes' we can."
the house is the familiar type of two-room negro house, with a porch
across the front, and a shed room on the back. the bedroom had been
papered with scraps of wallpaper of varied designs and so old that most
of it had fallen off. the mantel is covered with the colored comics
section, cut in a fancy pattern of scallops. at the entrance of the
house is a sack nailed to the floor and used for a foot mat, and at the
two upper corners of the door are horse shoes for good luck. nelson said
he is a member of the african methodist episcopal zion church, and has
been a methodist all his life; that he and his wife virginia "had only
two chillun' and dey were bofe dead."
nelson's wife, virginia, came from a family of slaves, although she was
not one herself. she said her folks were owned by mr. joe pickett of
camden, wilcox county, alabama. she said she just can remember mr. joe
taking her in his buggy, and she called him "toe-toe," as she couldn't
say his name plainly. she also said as she grew older she always spoke
of mr. joe, as "my papa," instead of "my master," for "he sho' was good
to me." she remembers her mother being chambermaid on the "old
eleanora," a boat on the alabama river, and as a small child going back
and forth on the boat with her. when they finally settled in mobile, her
mother worked for the family of dr. heustis who lived in the corner
house now occupied by the new federal court house and custom house, at
st. louis and st. joseph streets.
ank bishop
interview with ank bishop
—ruby pickens tartt, livingston, alabama
when "gabr'el take his silver trump," he is going to blow soft for the
saved and loud for the lost souls, according to ank bishop who was born
into slavery eighty-nine years ago, and lives in livingston, alabama.
the days before the war were as good as the present, ank believes. he
tells of them in the following story of his life:
"my name is ank bishop, en i was born in , august th, at ward,
alabama. my mother's name was amy larken, an' my father was tom bishop.
i had three brothers, alf, volen an' jim, an' two sisters, cely an'
matildy. us belonged to lady liza larkin at ward, right nigh coke's
chapel.
"my mother was brought out from south car'lina in a speculator drove,
an' lady liza bought her at de auction at coke's chapel. she lef' her
mammy an' daddy back dere in south car'lina an' never did see 'em no
more in dis life. she was bidded off an' lady liza got her, jes' her one
from all her family. she was got fer lady liza's house gal. but
sometimes she cooked or was de washer, den ag'in de milker. 'twas my job
for to min' de ca'ves. sometimes i went to mr. ed western's sto' at
gaston, three miles from us house, to see iffen was any mail for lady
liza, but 'twa'n't none.
"dey was good to us 'caze lady liza's son, mr. willie larkin, was de
overseer for his ma, but co'se sometime dey git among 'em an' thrashed
'em out. one time one de niggers runned away, old caesar townsy, an' dey
sarnt for dick peters to come an' bring his "nigger dogs." dem dogs was
trained to ketch a nigger same as rabbit dogs is trained to ketch a
rabbit. so mr. willie larkin told stuart for to say to old man dick
peters when he come, 'i'm gone,' but for him to come on. 'i'm gwineter
keep de road,' he say, 'an' cross 'bigbee at moscow landin'.' so ol'
dick peters, he kept de road lack he tole him to, an' he cross 'bigbee
at moscow landin' over in de cane-brake. but dem nigger dogs didn't
never ketch ol' man caesar. he stayed right wharever he was at 'twell
after s'render, an' de war done ceased. den he come out, but iffen he
had a been caught, dey'd a used him up pretty rough, but he stayed hid
twell de time done passed.
"all de women on lady liza's place had to go to de fiel' ev'y day an'
dem what had suckerlin' babies would come in 'bout nine o'clock in de
mawnin' an' when de bell ring at twelve an' suckerlin' 'em. one woman
tended to all of 'em in one house. her name was ellie larkin, an' dey
call her 'mammy larkin.' she all time sarnt me down in de fiel' for to
git 'em come suckle de chillen, 'caze dat made hit hard on her when dey
gets hongry an' cry.
"us didn't get to go to church none, an' us wa'n't larnt nothin'. i'm
nigh 'bout ninety an' i can't read a line. i got some chillun kin read;
one can't whut is sixty-five, but henry he fifteen an' he kin. de ma,
she go by de name of pearlie beasley, she can't read neither, but she's
a good fiel' han' an' she patched dese breeches i'm wearin' an' dis ole
shirt. miss, i ain't got a coat to my name. can't go to church, so i
doan' know dat dis any better'n slav'y time. hit's hard, anyway you got
to travel, got yo' nose on de groun' rock all de time. when pay day
come, ain't nothin' pay wid. come git de rent, den you out do's ag'in.
bred an' bawn in sumter county, wore out in sumter county, 'specks to
die in sumter county, an' whut is i got? ain't got nothin', ain't got
nothin', ain't got nothin'.
ank bishop, livingston, alabama
"but i'm a believer, an' dis here voodoo an' hoodoo an' sper'ts ain't
nothin' but a lot of folk's outten christ. ha'nts ain't nothin' but
somebody died outten christ an' his sper't ain't at res', jes' in a
wand'rin' condition in de world.
"dis is de evil sper't what de bible tells about when hit say a person
has got two sper'ts, a good one an' a evil one. de good sper't goes to a
place of happiness an' rest, an' you doan' see hit no mo', but de evil
sper't ain't got no place to go. hit's dwellin' place done tore down
when de body died, an' hit's jes' a wand'rin' an a waitin' for gabr'el
to blow his trump, den de worl' gwineter come to an en'. but when god
say, 'take down de silver mouf trump an' blow, gabr'el,' an' gabr'el
say, 'lord, how loud shell i blow?' den de lord say, 'blow easy,
gabr'el, en ca'm, not to 'larm my lilies.' de secon' time gabr'el say,
'how loud mus' i blow, lord?' den de lord say, 'blow hit as loud as
seben claps of thunder all added into one echo, so as to wake up dem
damnable sper'ts sleepin' in de grave-ya'ds what ain't never made no
peace wid dey god, jes' alayin' dere in dey sins.'
"but de christ'en army, hit gits up wid de fus' trump, an' dem
what is deef is de evil ones what anybody kin see anytime. i ain't
skeered of 'em, though. i passes 'em an' goes right on plowin',
but iffen you wants 'em to git outten your way, all you gotter do
is jes' turn your head least bit an' look back. dey gone jes' lack
dat! when my fus' wife died 'bout thirty years ago, i was goin' up
to gaston to see sara drayden, ole scot drayden's wife, an' i tuck
out through kennedy bottom 'bout sundown right after a rain. i
seed sompin acomin' down de road 'bout dat high, 'bout size a little
black shaggy dog, an' i says, 'what's dat i sees commin' down de
road? ain't nobody 'roun' here got no black shaggy dog? hit kep'
a-comin' an' kep' a-gittin' bigger an' bigger an' closer an' closer,
an' time hit got right to me 'twas as big as a ha'f growed yearlin',
black as a crow. it had four feet an' drop years, jes' lack a dog,
but 'twa'n't no dog, i knows dat. den he shy out in de bushes, an'
he come right back in de road, an' hit went on de way i was comin'
from, so i went on de way hit was comin' from. i ain't never seed
dat thing no mo'. but i'ze gotter pretty good notion 'bout who
hit 'twas."
siney bonner
interview with siney bonner
—w.f. jordan
"hear dat whistle?" the speaker was siney bonner, an ex-slave, now
living in the norwood section of birmingham. she had stopped for a
"confab" where a group of other elderly negroes of the neighborhood had
gathered. "de whistles on dem big jacks what pull dese highsteppin' i.c.
trains mind me of dem steamboats what used to pull up at de landin' at
ole pickensville on de tombigbee river.
"'cose dar wa'n't no railroads dem days an' de onlies' way folks had
trabbelin' about was de steamboat which passed most every week, and de
stage coach which passed twice a week.
"lawsy, man, dem was de days, and many de time atter my daddy, whose
name was green bonner, heard dat steamboat blow below pickensville, he
would hitch up de mules to de waggin and foller massa john on hossback
down to de landin' to fetch back de supply of sugar and coffee and
plow-tools needed on de plantation. dey would take me 'long to hold de
mules and watch de waggin and it was a reglar picnic to me to see de big
shiney boat and watch de goin's on.
"massa john bonner sho' did 'pend on my daddy. de massa paid a thousand
green-back dollars for him down to mobile. 'nuf green-backs to wrap him
up in, he said, so he named him green bonner.
"yes suh, we was all baptis'—de deep water kind, and every sunday dey
used to pile us into de waggins and pull out bright and early for big
creek church on the carrollton road. everybody fetched a big basket of
grub and, sakes alive! sech another dinner you never see, all spread out
on de grassy grove by de ole graveyard. mos' all de quality white folks
belonged at big creek and when dere slaves got sho' nuff 'ligion, dey
have 'em jine at big creek and be baptized at de swimmin' hole. some of
de niggers want to have dere own meetin's, but lawd chile, dem niggers
get happy and get to shoutin' all over de meadow where dey built a brush
arbor. massa john quick put a stop to dat. he say, 'if you gwine to
preach and sing you must turn de wash pot bottom up'; meanin', no
shoutin'. dem baptis' at big creek was sho' tight wid dere rules too.
turn you out sho' if you drink too much cawn licker, or dance, or cuss.
"massa john had a big fine bird dog. she was a mammy dog and one day she
foun' six puppies out in de harness house. dey was mos' all girl puppies
so massa gwine drown 'em. i axed him to give 'em to me and purty soon de
missus sent me to de pos'office, so i put de puppies in a basket and
took 'em wid me. dr. lyles come by whar i was settin' and he say, 'want
to sell dem pups, siney?' i tell him, uh-huh. den he say, 'what
'nomination is dey?'. i tell him, dey's methodis' dogs. he didn' say no
mo'. bout a week atter dat ole missus sent me to 'de pos'office again,
so i took my basket of puppies. sho' nuff, 'long come dr. lyles and he
say, 'siney, see you still ain't sold dem pups'. i say, 'naw-suh'. den
he axed me ag'in what 'nomination dey b'long to. i tole him dey was
baptis' dogs. he say, 'how come? you tole me las' week dem was methodis'
pups'. ha-ha! bless god!, look like he had me. but i say, 'yas-suh, but
you see, doctah, dey got dere eyes open since den!' he laff and go on
down to his newspaper office.
siney bonner, birmingham, alabama
"how old is i? law chile, i don't know. my mammy say i was fifteen year
old time of de surrender. i 'members dat mighty well. massa john call
all de niggers on de plantation 'round him at de big house and he say
to 'em 'now, you all jes' as free as i is. i ain't your marster no mo'.
i'se tried to be good to you and take keer of all of you. you is all
welcome to stay and we'll all wuk togedder and make a livin' somehow. ef

some stayed and some lef'. my daddy stayed wid marse john till he was
called home to glory. now dey all gone but siney, and i'se jes' here,
waitin' for 'em to call me.
"yas suh, i been 'round carrollton a heap. atter marse john and my daddy
bofe died, i wuk'd 'round from place to place. used to wuk for mrs.
roper at de old phoenix hotel. i recollect when de new brick court house

named bill burkhalter for settin' it on fire. dey sent him to de pen'
an' some officers started wid him to montgomery. when dey got to sipsey
river a mob ketched up wid 'em an' took bill and hung him dere in the
swamp. 'bout dat time a bad cloud come up. dey axed bill did he have
anything to say. he say, 'i ain't burn no court house, an' ef you all

jennie bowen
interview with jennie bowen
—mary a. poole, mobile
jennie bowen was surrounded by numerous little colored children as i
came upon her sitting on her front porch. she answered my questions
through a mouth void of teeth and with a constant blinking of her brown
eyes with their muddy whites. her little grand-child had to act to some
extent as an interpreter, as her speech was at times most indistinct.
"yassum, i remembers lots of things dat happened back in de days of de
cibil war," she said. "i remembers de place whar i lived. it were de
prettiest house you ever seed. it were on a high hill overlooking a
small creek and de flowers 'roun' in de yard was somp'n to see, sho'

nannie bradfield
interview with nannie bradfield
—susie r. o'brien, uniontown, alabama
nannie bradfield is a fat little old woman almost as broad as she is
long, with a pleasant face and a broad smile which displays white teeth
still good at the age of eighty-five. she lives alone in a dilapidated
cabin which rests in a clump of trees by the side of the railroad. the
sagging roof is patched with pieces of rusty tin of many shapes and
sizes.
"nannie," i said, "aren't you afraid to live here alone?"
"how come i be skeered? ain't nobody gwine bother me lessen it be a
spirit, and dey don't come 'roun' 'cep'n on rainy nights, den all you

so i jes' as well start gittin' 'quainted wid de spirits."
"tell me something about yourself and your family, nannie," i said.
"dere ain't nothin' much to tell 'cep i was born in slav'y times and i

powder on it and burns it den you can't never set down in no peace. you
jes' like you settin' on a coal of fiah 'till you git somebody to take

"nannie, were you glad when the war was over and you were free?"
"what i keer 'bout bein' free? didn't old marster give us plenty good
sompin to eat and clo's to wear? i stayed on de plantation 'til i

"'marry in brown you'll live out of town?'" i quoted. "dat's it—my

years old. she was a slave to dr. lucas of mt. meigs neighborhood long
before the war between the states. dr. lucas is one of the well known
lucas family, with whom general lafayette spent some time while touring
the united states in .
"our marster wuz sho good to all his 'niggers'," she said. "us allus had
plenty to eat and plenty to wear, but de days now is hard, if white
folks gin you a nickel or dime to git you sumpin' t' eat you has to
write everything down in a book before you can git it. i allus worked in
the field, had to carry big logs, had strops on my arms and them logs
was put in de strop and hauled to a pile where they all was. one morning
hit was rainin' ad i didn' wanna go to the field, but de oversee' he
come and got me and started whooping me. i jumped on him and bit and
kicked him 'til he lemme go. i didn't know no better then. i didn't know
he was de one to do dat.
"but marster lucas gin us big times on christmas and july. us 'ud have
big dinners and all the lemonade us could drink. the dinner'd be spread

i say, 'no sir! dat knife just flew 'roun by itself and cut dat cake.'
"one day i was workin' in de field and de overseer he come 'roun and say

lucas come and got me and started whoopin' me. i say to marster lucas
whut dat overseer sez to me and marster lucas didn' hit me no more.
marse lucas was allus good to us and he wouldn' let nobody run over his
niggers.
"there was plenty white folks dat was sho bad to de niggers, and
specially dem overseers. a nigger whut lived on the plantation jinin'
ours shot and killed an overseer; den he run 'way. he come to de river
and seed a white man on udder side and say, 'come and git me.' well,

allen brown
interview with allen brown
—gertha couric
uncle allen is a thin little man with a short white beard that hides
nothing of his ready, toothless smile always evident when conversing
with "de white folks" and contributes to his dignified mien when
solemnly lecturing to "de niggers" about their "no 'count ways." he is
as deaf as the proverbial post, and, once launched into a discourse,
rambles on to its end without regard to interruptions. asked to tell
something of his early life, he said:
allen brown, eufala, alabama
"i is nigh on to a hundred yeahs old, suh, and i was brung to dis
country from virginny whar i was bawn. my mammy's mahster was movin'
from virginny to texas, and when he go dis fur he sole me and my mammy
to mahster mcrea. den mahster mcrea he give me to miss julia; den miss
julia she mah'ied mahs henry young and i was dere ca'iage driver. mahs
henry soon went off to de wawh and was kilt in de battle of gettysbu'g
and dat nearly bout kilt miss julia.
"a'ter de surrender nothin' neber was de same. jest hahd times mos'ly.
neber been any times lak de days when i was drivin' my ca'iage amongst
de eufaula high steppers, and i reckon dere neber will be ag'in.
"de ole man too ole and bruck down to wuhk now, and i gits along wid
whut de welfare gives me."
gus brown
interview with gus brown
—alexander b. johnson, birmingham, alabama
"they is all gone, scattered, and old massa and missus have died." that
was the sequence of the tragic tale of "uncle" gus brown, the body
servant of william brown; who fought beside him in the war between the
states and who knew stonewall jackson.
"uncle gus" recalled happenings on the old plantation where he was
reared. his master was a "king" man, he said, on whose plantation in
richmond, virginia, uncle gus waited on the tables at large feasts and
functions of the spacious days before the war. he was entrusted to go
with the master's boys down to the old swimming hole and go in "washin."
they would take off their clothes, hide them in the bushes on the side
of the bank, put a big plank by the side of the old water hole and go in
diving, swimming and have all the fun that youngsters would want, he
said.
apparently his master's home was a plantation house with large columns
and with all the glitter and glamour that the homes around richmond have
to offer. about it were large grain storage places for the master was a
grain dealer and men on the plantation produced and ground large
quantities into flour.
gus worked around the house, and he remembers well the corn shuckings as
he called them on which occasions the negroes gave vent to emotion in
the form of dancing and music. "on those occasions we all got together
and had a regular good time," he said.
"uncle," he was asked, "do you remember any of the old superstitions on
the plantation? did they have any black cat stories?"
"no sir, boss, we was educated negroes on our plantation. the old
bossman taught his negroes not to believe in that sort of thing.
"i well remember when de war came. old massa had told his folks befo' de
war began dat it was comin', so we was ready for it.
"beforehand the master called all the servants he could trust and told
them to get together all of the silver and other things of value. they
did that, he explained and afterward they took the big box of treasures
and carried it out in the forest and hid it under the trunk of a tree
which was marked. none of the negroes ever told the yankees where it was
so when the war ended the master had his silver back. of course the war
left him without some of the things which he used to have but he never
suffered.
"then de war came and we all went to fight the yankees. i was a body
servant to the master, and once a bullet took off his hat. we all
thought he was shot but he wasn't, and i was standin' by his side all
the time.
"i remember stonewall jackson. he was a big man with long whiskers, and
very brave. we all fought wid him until his death.
"we wan't beaten, we was starved out! sometimes we had parched corn to
eat and sometimes we didn't have a bite o' nothin', because the union
mens come and tuck all the food for their selves. i can still remember
part of my ninety years. i remembers we fought all de way from virginia
and winded up in manassas gap.
"when time came for freedom most of us was glad. we liked the yankees.
they was good to us. 'you is all now free. you can stay on the
plantation or you can go.' we all stayed there until old massa died. den
i worked on de seaboard airline when it come to birmingham. i have been
here ever since.
gus brown, birmingham, alabama
"in all de years since de war i cannot forget old massa. he was good and
kind. he never believed in slavery but his money was tied up in slaves
and he didn't want to lose all he had.
"i knows i will see him in heaven and even though i have to walk ten
miles for a bite of bread i can still be happy to think about the good
times we had then. i am a confederate veteran but my house burned up wid
de medals and i don't get a pension.
"thank you, mister bossman, fer the quarter. it will buy me a little
grub. i'se too old to work but i has to."
the reporter left him sitting with his little pack and a long fork in
his hands; in his eyes, dimmed with age, a far-off look and a tear of
longing for the old plantation.
walter calloway
interview with walter calloway
—w.f. jordan
walter calloway lives alone half a block off avenue f, the thoroughfare
on the southside of birmingham on which live many of the leaders in the
negro life of the city. for his eighty-nine years he was apparently
vigorous except for temporary illness. a glance at the interior of his
cabin disclosed the fact that it was scrupulously neat and quite orderly
in arrangement, a characteristic of a great many ex-slaves. as he sat in
the sunshine on his tiny front porch, his greeting was: "come in, white
folks. you ain't no doctor is you?"
to a negative reply, he explained as he continued, "fo' de las' past
twenty-five years i been keepin' right on, wukkin' for de city in de
street department. 'bout two mont's ago dis mis'ry attackted me an'
don't 'pear lak nothin' dem doctors gimme do no good. de preacher he

what he gwine to sen' him to see me. i sho' wants to git well ag'in
pow'ful bad, but mebby i done live long 'nuff an' my time 'bout come."
quizzed about his age and antecedents, he began his story: "well, sir,
cap'n, i was born in richmond, virginny, in . befo' i was ole 'nuff
to 'member much, my mammy wid me an' my older brudder was sold to marse
john calloway at snowdoun in montgomery county, ten miles south of de

'mount to much.
walter calloway, birmingham, alabama
"when de war started 'mos' all i know 'bout it was all de white mens go

so he go 'long wid de ration wagon to montgomery 'mos' ebry week. one

esther king casey
interview with esther king casey
—edward f. harper, birmingham
living with her grandchildren at  washington avenue, birmingham,
alabama, esther king casey, former slave of capt. henry king of
americus, georgia, recalls from fading memory a few vivid scenes of the
days when men in gray moved hurridly about the town, suddenly
disappeared for a while and then returned, one by one, with weary,
halting tread and hollow faces, while gloom and despair hovered over the
town like a pall of desolation.
less vivid in her memory are the stories told her by her grandmother
of a long voyage across the ocean, of the arrival in a new land
called mobile, and of slaves being sold at public auction. less vivid,
too, are the memories of her own journey to georgia, where she, with
her parents and brother, were brought to be the slaves of captain king.
"i was only four or five years old when we came to captain king's big
house," said the old woman, brightening with pride in her ability to
recollect. her manners bore the marks of culture and refinement, and her
speech was surprisingly void of the usual negro dialect. she is an
example of the former slave who was educated along with the white
children in the family.
"there were eight or ten slaves in all," esther continued. "we lived in
a house in the backyard of captain king's big house. my mamma was the
cook. papa was a mechanic. he built houses and made tools and machinery.
captain king gave me to the 'white lady;' that was miss susan, the
captain's wife. captain king was a fine man. he treated all of us just
like his own family. the 'white lady' taught us to be respectable and
truthful."
when asked if she had ever been punished for misbehavior the old woman
smiled and said: "once the 'white lady' whipped me for playing with the
jailer's children. she had told me not to play with them because they
were not good company for me. she said that she wanted to raise me to be
good and truthful, and that the jailer's little white children told lies
and talked bad."
esther remembers well the mobilization of gray-uniformed troops at the
courthouse which stood only a block from the king residence. "the town
was filled with soldiers for several days," she said. "they assembled
about the courthouse and had speakings. one day i passed there with my
papa and saw abraham lincoln hanging from a noose in the courthouse
square. of course, it was only an effigy of abraham lincoln which was
used to show what the soldiers thought of him. papa told me that the
soldiers shot the effigy full of bullet holes before they left town.
"before captain king left he brought a man with him from the courthouse
to value his property. the slaves were valued, too. i remember captain
king lifting me high above his head and saying to the man: 'i wouldn't
take a thousand dollars for this little gem.'"
she paused a moment. the light in her eyes showed that she was reliving
the thrill of that childhood incident.
"then captain king left with the other soldiers. papa stayed and took
care of the 'white lady' and the house. after a while my brother ran
away and joined the troops to fight for captain king. he came back after
the war, but captain king did not. several years later i saw a man down
in south georgia who told me that he belonged to captain king's troops.
he said that he was standing near him when he was killed.
esther king casey, birmingham, alabama
"after the proclamation the slaves were free. most of them leased out to
plantation owners. i stayed with mamma and the 'white lady.'"
mrs. king had taught the little slave girl to read and write, and when
schools were opened for the freed slaves she told the child's mother to
send her to school. fees of fifty cents a month were charged, which
mrs. king paid as long as the child remained with her. at eighteen years
of age the girl had acquired sufficient education to qualify to teach in
the public schools for negroes. after three years of teaching she
married jim casey, an ex-slave, who took her to his "three-plow" farm in
south georgia.
"no man ever lived who was finer than jim," said the old woman. "my
daughter used to say that i loved him more than god, and that god was
jealous and took him away from me."
after her only daughter's death in , esther was brought to
birmingham by her grandson who has kept her comfortably ever since. her
hair is just turning gray, though she was born in . the little briar
pipe, which she endeavors to conceal from strangers, is the only outward
evidence that she has anything in common with others of her
generation.
amy chapman
interview with amy chapman
—ruby f. tartt, livingston, alabama
aunt amy paused as she worked among the small plants in her garden,
removing a weed here and there. she pushed back the sunbonnet that
shaded her eyes and began:
"i was bawn on governor reuben chapman's place five miles north of
livingston on may , . my name is amy chapman. my mother was clary
chapman an' my pappy was bob chapman. dey both come from virginny; my
mammy from petersburg an' my pappy f'um richmond. dey was driv' down to
alabamy lak cattle an' marse reuben bought 'em. he had a lot of slaves
caze he had a heap of plantations, but him an' his wife stay most of de
time in huntsville an' dey had a heap of white oberseers. i had a plenty
of chilluns but not as many as my mammy.
"who was my husban'? law chile, i ain't never had no special husban'. i
even forgits who was de pappy of some of dese chilluns of mine.
"us had a mean oberseer, an' since marse reuben warn't never at home,

"i could tell you 'bout bein' run myself wid dem nigger dogs, but i

emma chapman
interview with emma chapman
—mary a. poole
living in a small room in the rear of a house at  augusta street,
mobile, alabama, the writer located an interesting ex-slave, emma
chapman, who when first approached was somewhat reticent. i soon learned
i had arrived just as she was ready to have her breakfast, which
consisted of bread and coffee, and insisted she eat first and talk
afterwards, as she had made just about enough fire in the open fireplace
to boil the coffee.
while she followed my suggestion i glanced about the room and found it
very neat and tidy and an unusually comfortable looking double bed, a
mirrored door chifferobe and two trunks, one rocking chair and a couple
of straight chairs, a table containing all cooking utensils and food
containers. the walls were covered with sheets of manilla wrapping
paper, tacked on, and part of the ceiling patched with odds and ends of
corrugated paper. emma is small in stature, of light complexion with
greying hair arranged in neat braids around her head, very clean in
appearance.
emma said she was about  years of age at the time of the surrender,
and that she was born on the plantation of rev. mr. montgomery curry of
charleston, s.c. when she was about  years of age mr. curry moved to
pickens county, alabama, about  miles from carrollton and  miles from
pickenville. when i asked why they moved to alabama, emma laughed, and
said they expected to find money growing on trees in alabama, and that
she as a child came near being "snake bit" many a time, digging around
the roots of old trees, trying to find money.
rev. montgomery curry, said emma, was married to ann haynie, whose
parents were aaron and francis hudson haynie, and emma's grandmother
was lucy linier, who was born in virginia and was sold to mr. haynie to
pay a debt. lucy linier was nurse for his daughter ann and when she
married mr. curry, she brought lucy with her to her new home. the currys
had three children, a boy and two girls, and it was lucy linier's
daughter, patsy, who acted as their nurse.
the home of rev. and mrs. montgomery curry was a two-story log house
with wide open hall running the entire length of the house and with
rooms opening off either side. the kitchen was out a short distance from
the main house, with the dairy between the two, under a large hickory
tree.
the slave quarters were also built of logs, with space between for a
shed room and small garden plot and a few chickens. the slave women did
not go to the fields on saturday as that was their day to clean up
around their homes. they usually washed their clothes at night and hung
them on the bushes where they were left to dry in the sunshine, maybe a
couple of days, as no one could or would disturb them.
rev. montgomery curry was a baptist preacher and had no overseer, except
lucy linier and her husband, emma's grandparents, who kept a supervision
over the slaves about  in number. there was no whipping allowed on the
curry plantation, and after the death of reverend curry, mrs. ann curry
(his widow) ran the plantation under the same system. the patrollers had
no jurisdiction over the curry slaves, they were given permits by the
currys to go and come, and emma said if one of those patrollers whipped
one of "ole miss's slaves, she would have sure sued them.
emma laughingly said the slaves on other plantations always said the
curry slaves were "free niggers," as they could always get permits, and
had plenty to eat and milk to drink. the slaves cooked their breakfasts
in their own cabins, but dinner and supper was cooked in the kitchen and
each came with their pan to be filled and had their own gourds which
were grown on the place to drink their milk and of which they could have
full and plenty.
during the war they cooked for the confederate soldiers encamped nearby
and great quantities were prepared. emma was one of those delegated to
carry the food to the camp. all she ever saw of the yankees were two who
stopped at the house and asked for something to eat. mrs. montgomery
invited them in and served the best she had. one of the men wanted to
take the last mule she had and the other said "no, mrs. montgomery is a
widow and from the appearance of her slaves she has treated them well."
mrs. montgomery told them that someone had stolen her saddle horse and
the soldier who had remonstrated with the other replied: "madam, your
saddle horse will be returned in three weeks," and sure enoug, one night
about midnight they heard a horse whinny and emma's grandfather said
"there is old spunk," and there was old spunk waiting outside.
emma said the first whipping she ever had, was after the surrender,
given her by her own father when they left alabama and went to live near
columbus, miss.
she had always lived in the house with the "old miss" and her young
miss, and when she had to leave them, she cried and so did they.
her grandmother lucy linier nursed "miss ann"; lucy's daughter patsy
nursed "miss ann's" children, and was the special property of fannie
montgomery curry, who married a mr. sidney lipscomb and whose children
emma helped to look after, so the three generations were interwoven.
emma only wishes she could go back to plantation days. all her trials
and suffering came after she left "ole miss," and went to live with her
father and mother, george and patsy curry, who had fourteen children and
of which emma was the eldest. her father who was a quadroon in cast was
cruel to his family, and especially so to her. he made her work like a
man, cutting timber, splitting rails, digging, planting and all work of
the farm.
now, emma is the only member of her family left. she married three
times, having only two children, a girl and a boy, these by her last
husband, frank chapman, now dead, and emma has no knowledge of her
children's whereabouts. she gave them an education so they could write
to her if they wanted to. the girl married and left mobile, the boy went
to chicago, was chauffeur for some rich folks. his last letter several
years ago, in which he enclosed $., stated he was going on a trip to
jerusalem with one of the young men of the family.
henry cheatam
interview with henry cheatam
—ila b. prine
"white folks, i'se glad you drapped by to have a talk wid me. i was
gittin' powerfully lonely," said henry cheatam, who lives in marysville,
a mobile suburb. "sho' i'll be glad to tell you some about de slave
days. i sho' 'members plenty. well, to begin wid, i was born in 
near west point. dat's in clay county, mississippi, you know. i b'longed
to mr. tom hollingshead who was killed in de cibil war. i 'members all
de slaves agoin' in to take a last look at him atter dey done brung his
body home.
"my mammy's name was emmeline cheatam, an' my pappy's was sam cheatam. i
don't remember my grandpappy an' grandmammy atall.
"us slaves libed in log cabins what was daubed wid clay to keep de rain
an' win' out, an' de chimneys was made of clay an' sticks. de beds was
home-made an' nailed agin' de wall wid legs on de outer side. de massa's
house was build of logs too, but it was much bigger'n de nigger cabins
an' sot way out in front of ourn. atter de massa was kilt, old miss had
a nigger oberseer an' dat was de meanest debil dat eber libbed on de
lawd's green yearth. i promise myself when i growed up dat i was agoin'
to kill dat nigger iffen it was de las' thing i eber done. lots of times
i'se seen him beat my mammy, an' one day i seen him beat my auntie who
was big wid a chile, an' dat man dug a roun' hole in de groun' an' put
her stummick in it, an' beat an' beat her for a half hour straight till
the baby come out raght dere in de hole.
"why de mistis 'low such treatment? a heap of times ole miss didn't know
nuthin' 'bout it, an' de slaves better not tell her, 'caze dat oberseer
whup 'em iffen he finds out dat dey done gone an' tol'. yassun, white
folks, i'se seed some turrible things in my time. when de slaves would
try to run away our oberseer would put chains on dere legs wid big long
spikes tween dere feets, so dey couldn't git away. den i's seen great
bunches of slaves put up on de block an' sol' jus' lak dey was cows.
sometimes de chilluns would be seprated from dere maws an' paws.
"i come pretty near to bein' tuk away from my maw. when de slaves was
bein' 'vided, one of ole miss' datters was agoin' to texas, an' i was
goin' to have to go when somebody hollered 'freedom', an' i sho' was
glad 'caze i could stay wid my mammy now.
"in dose days us had plenty of good, plain food; such as pot likker,
greens, cornbread, 'taters, peas, pears, an' at hog killin' us had
chittlin's an' pig jowls an' back bone. den us would cotch 'possums at
night when dey come up in de corn fiel'. us neber seed no flour dough.
"as for fishin', we neber did none, 'caze we hadda work too hard. we
worked from 'can to can't.' git up at sunrise, go to de fiel' an' stay
till dark. in de middle of de day dey would sen' our somp'n t'eat to de
fiel' wid a barrel of water. but for breakfas' an' supper, us hadda cook
our own grub dey gib us.
"our clo's warn't many. us chilluns wo' a one-piece suit made outen
osnaburg, an' us would hab to take dat off at night, wash it an' put it
back on de nex' day. as for shoes, chillun neber had none. you see,
white folks, i was jus' a chile, jus' big enough to tote water to de
fiel's.
henry cheatam, marysville, alabama
"i 'members when de yankees was acomin' th'ough i hoped to ca'y de
hosses to de woods an' hoped to hide de meat an' bury de valu'bles,
'caze dem yankees tuk whatever dey wanted, an' you better not say
nothin' neither 'caze dey had dem long swyords ahangin' at dere sides.
"in dem days, de slaves done all de work an' carried all de news. de
marsters sont notes from one plantation to anudder, an' when dey wanted
de niggers to come to de big house dey would blow an ole cow horn. dey
had certain number of blows for certain niggers. dat is, de niggers dat
was somp'n. dey would also use dis horn for 'possum an' coon huntin' at
night. de li'l niggers at night went to de big house to spin an' weave.
i'se spun a many roll an' carded a many bat of cotton. i'se also made a
many tallow candle by tyin' strings onto a long stick an' droppin dem
down into moulds filled wid tallow. i'se hid many a night in de fence
corners when i'd be agoin' som'ers to git my mammy some 'bacco. de
pattyrollers would be out lookin' for slaves dat didn't hab no pass from
dere oberseer, an' i'd hear dem acomin' an' i'd hide till dey pass on,
'caze iffen dey cotch me i sho' gwine have a sound beatin'.
"de owners always tuk care of us, and when us got sick dey would git a
doctor, an' ole miss was all right, but dat oberseer was a debil. he
wouldn't 'low no meetin' on de place. sometimes us would slip down de
hill an' turn de wash pot bottom up'ards so de soun' of our voices would
go under de pot, an' us'd have a singin' an' prayin' raght dere.
"mos' of de slave could go sometimes to de white folks church when dey
gits a pass from dere massa, but dat mean oberseer always tried to keep
us from goin' so's us couldn't learn nothin'. he didn't want us to learn
to read or write neither.
"no'm us didn't have nothin' lak matches till i was growed. us used
flint rocks an' cotton to start de fires.
"us didn't have nothin' but food an' clothes. we didn't have no garden
of our own an' der wan't no celebratin', 'ceptin' at hog killin'. dat
was de bigges' day of de year.
"on sat'day afternoon we was 'lowed to play, but i can't 'member none of
de games. us jus' played lak all li'l niggers did den. at night time us
jus' went to our cabins an' went to bed, 'caze we warn't 'lowed to do no
singing. mos' of de singin' was done in de fiel's.
"cornshuckin' time come when dey wanted to git de seed corn for
plantin', an' us would commence de shuckin' when it commence rainin'.
"you axed me 'bout funerals an' weddin's. us niggers nebber ma'ied an'
don't 'member any big weddin's of de white folks. but dey buried folks
den de same as dey does now, in a box. dey would bury de slaves same as
dey done de white folks, but us didn't eben have no babtizin' on 'count
of dat oberseer. he didn't lak for us to git no religion. cose all
slaves didn't have hard treatment lak us did, 'caze dere oberseer an'
marster warn't as mean as ourn.
"no'm we didn't know nothin' 'bout no hoodoo stuff in dem days. dey only
had homemade medicines, dat is unless dey got sho' nuff powerful sick
an' den dey would go to see a doctor. us used bone-set tea made from a
weed. lawd, it was bitterer dan quinine, an' it were good for de chills
an' fever, an' it would purge you too. den us used life-everlastin' tea
for fever, an' jerusalem brush-reed to get rid of worms.
"but, miss, i knows dere is gostes, 'caze when i was a little boy my
mammy come in from de fiel' an' laid across de bed an' i was sittin' in
front of de fireplace an' a big somp'n lak a cow widout no haid come in
de do' an' i commence to beat on it wid my fists. den my mammy say:
'what matter wid you, nigger?' den dat critter he walk raght out de
do'. i looked outen de window an' dere it was a-goin' in aunt marfa's
cabin. i neber did see it no mo'. den anudder time a white man died an'
my mammy was a stayin' wid his sister an' dis spirit lak an angel come
to my mammy an' tol' her to tell de white lady to read de bible
back'ards three times, 'caze dere was one talent 'tween her an' jesus.
atter dat she were comforted. anudder time, my pappy, sam cheatam, who
was a wicked man, was a-sittin' in front of de fire an' a big brindle
dog come to de do' an' started barkin'. my pappy say: 'what in de hell
am dat?' an' snapped his fingers at de dog. de dog he den dropped daid.
some folks say dat dere ain't no sich things as gostes, but i know dere
is, 'caze dere is good spirits an' bad spirits.
"dem was good ol' days, mistis, even iffen us did have a hard time an' i
don't know iffen it warn't better'n it is now. i has to almos' go
hongry, an' i can't git no he'p from de government, 'caze i is over 
years old. fact is, i believe i 'druther be alivin' back dere dan today
'caze us at least had plenty somp'n t'eat an' nothin' to worry about.
an' as for beatin'; dey beats folks now iffen dey don't do raght, so
what's de difference? yassum, mistis, i worked as long as i was able an'
didn't axe nobody for nothin', but now it's diff'rent, 'caze i ain't
able to do no work. i'se tried to do raght and ain't never been in but
one fight in my life. i now belongs to de corinthian babtist church, an'
i's tryin' to live so when de good lawd calls i'll be ready to answer
wid a clean soul.
"i'se had two wives, but i was only a young nigger when i had de fust
un, an' had two chilluns by her, den i lef' her 'caze she warn't no
'count. dat's been forty year ago, an' i ain't neber seen my chilluns in
all dem years. my second wife i got when i lived thirty miles below
birmingham, alabama, at de ol' bank mines. dat's been thirty-five year
ago an' us is still together. us ain't neber had no chilluns. no'm, i
don't know nothin' 'bout abe lincoln 'ceptin' dey say he sot us free,
an' i don't know nothin' 'bout dat neither."
laura clark
interview with laura clark
—ruby pickens tartt, livingston, alabama
laura clark, black and wrinkled with her eighty-six years, moved
limpingly about the tiny porch of her cabin on the outskirts of
livingston. battered cans and rickety boxes were filled with a profusion
of flowers of the common variety. laura offered me a split-bottomed
chair and lowered herself slowly into a rocker that creaked even under
her frail body. "po'ly, miss, po'ly," she responded to my query about
her health. "tain't lack de old days. i's crippled and mos' blin' now
atter all de years what i got.
"i was born on mr. pleasant powell's place in north ca'lina, and when i
was 'bout six or seven years ole i reckon hit 'twas, mr. garret from
right up yonder in de bend, 'bout eight miles from livingston gwine
no'th on de livingston and epes road, bought ten of us chillun in north
ca'lina and sont two white men, and one was mr. skinner, to fotch us
back in waggins. en he fotch ole julie powell and henry to look atter
us. wa'n't none of dem ten chillun no kin to me, and he never bought my
mammy, so i had to leave her behine.
"i recollect mammy said to old julie, 'take keer my baby chile (dat was
me) an iffen i never sees her no mo' raise her for god.' den she fell
off de waggin where us was all settin' and roll over on de groun' jes'
acryin'. but us was eatin' candy what dey done give us for to keep us
quiet, and i didn't have sense 'nuff for to know what ailed mammy, but i
knows now and i never seed her no mo' in dis life. when i heered from
her atter s'render she done dead and buried. her name was rachel powell.
my pappy's name i don't know ca'se he done been sole to somewhars else
when i was too little to recollect. but my mammy was de mother of
twenty-two chillun and she had twins in her lap when us driv' off. my
gran'mammy said when i lef', 'pray, laura, and be er good gal, and min'
bofe white and black. ev'body will lack you and iffen you never see me
no mo' pray to meet me in heaven.' den she cried. her name was rose
powell.
"us all started den for mr. garrett's plantation down yonder in de bend,
ten chillun and two ole uns, and two white men, and us was travellin'
solid a month. fuss thing ole marsa say was 'now be good ter dese
motherless chillun.' den he went to war, and de overseers forgot all
'bout dey promise. when ole marsa come back he done got his arm shot
off, but he let bofe dem overseers go, ca'se dey done whupped dat ole
'oman what come wid us to deaf. she brought her two little boys, colvin
and 'lias, but joe, dey pappy, didn't come—he was sole 'fo 'lias was
bawn. joe never seed 'lias.
laura clark, livingston, alabama
"i sets cross de road here from dat church over yonder and can't go
'ca'se i'm cripple' and blin', but i heers um singin':
a motherless chile sees a hard time
oh, lord, he'p her on de road.
'er sister will do de bes' she kin
dis is a hard world, lord, fer a motherless chile.
"and i jes' busts out cryin'. dat was de song i had in view to sing for
you, hit's so mournful. i knowed 'twa'n't no reel, 'twa'n't nothin' lack
no reel, 'ca'se i been b'longin' to de church for fifty-five years, and
i don't fancy no reel. i'm glad i got hit to my min' 'fo' you lef'. but
my recollection is shaller. i ain't never read no verse in no bible in
my life, ca'se i can't read. some my chillun kin, though. my husban'
died and lef' me wid nine chillun, none of um couldn't pull de others
outer de fire iffen dey fell in. i had mo'n dat, but some come here dead
and some didn't. i got chillun dead in birmingham and bessemer. dey
ain't a graveyard in dis here settlement 'roun' prospect where i ain't
got chillun buried. hettie ann, right up dere ter mr. hawkins'
graveyard, and my boy whut got killed settin' on de side de road eatin'
his dinner, he' buried in captain jones' place in de bend yonder.
"yassum, i been drug about and put through de shackles so bad i done
forgot some of dey names, and i mos' blin' now and can't hear good
neither. but my eyes is good nuff for to see ghosts, but i don't b'lieve
in 'em, 'ca'se i'd see dem chillun sometime effen dey was ghosties. i
know i'd see my boy, ca'se dey showed me his head whar dat miller boy
hit him in de head wid a spade and split his head wide open, slip up
behin' him and all he said was 'squeek,' jes' lack a hog, and he was
dead. and de murderer live right here but dey move and now i'm here.
when hit rain us jes' gets under de bed 'ca'se de house ain't got no top
on hit.
laura clark's house, livingston, alabama
"i can't say marse garrett wa'n't good to us motherless chillun but de
overseer, mr. woodson tucker, was mean as anybody. he'd whup you nigh
'bout to deaf, and had a whuppin' log what he strip 'em buck naked and
lay 'em on de log. he whup 'em wid a wide strop, wider'n my han', den he
pop de blisters what he raise and 'nint 'em wid red pepper, salt, and
vinegar. den he put 'em in de house dey call de pest house and have a
'oman stay dere to keep de flys offen 'em 'twell dey get able to move.
den dey had reg'lar men in de fields wid spades, and iffen you didn't do
what you git tole, de overseer would wrop dat strap 'roun' his han' and
hit you in de haid wid de wooden handle 'til he kilt you. den de mens
would dig a hole wid de spades and throw 'em in hit right dere in de
fiel' jes' lack dey was cows—didn't have no funeral nor nothin'.
"us had a heap of houses in de quarters right on bofe sides de big
house. us could step outer one house to 'tother. but, miss, i didn't
work so hard or have no trouble either. i was in de house atter marsa
come home and foun' me splittin' rails and plowin'. he 'lowed dey done
put me in too hard a ship, and i was too little, so he tuck me to de
house to draw water and wash dishes, 'ca'se i was a little motherless
gal. ole marsa done a good part by me, and i was married to my fuss
husban', cary crockett, right dere in de parlor. he tole de overseer dat
us was human and had feelin's same as him, so he rejected de
paterrollers and made 'em git off de place. i was treated good, 'ca'se i
'membered what my gran'ma say, and whatever dey tole me to put my han'
to, i did, and i was obedient and wasn't hardheaded lack some de res.' i
had no trouble, and wasn't 'buked none. but i's had mo' trouble las' ten
years wid my own chillun den i ever did in slav'y time. dey gives me
sich bitter words till i can't swaller 'em and i jes' sets and cries. i
can't read no songs to comfort me, jes' ketch 'em from de preacher on de
stan' and hole 'em, dat's de way i ketch my larnin'.
"las' sermon i hyard, he tuck his tex' en said, 'don't nobody
rob god.' den he say, 'effen you is goin' to 'tend to serve god, serve
him in de full, 'ca'se god don't never bat a eye, nor turn his haid
and he kin see you. he frowns at ev'y sin, but he's a sinforgivin'
man.' i use to know a heap 'bout de lord, but i'm so cripple' an
blin' since de ca'f jumped on my foot i can't go to church no mo', so
i done forgot.
"you ax 'bout dem flowers on de po'ch—i sho' wish dey was mine, you
could have 'em 'ca'se dey ain't room nuff wid dem for me ter sit whar i

hattie clayton
interview with hattie clayton
—preston klein
'aunt' hattie clayton said, "i'se gittin' erroun' de ninety notch,
honey, an' i reckon de kingdom ain't fur away."
she lives in a tiny cabin not far from opelika. her shoulders are bent;
her hair gray, but she still does a large amount of housework. she likes
to sit on the tumbledown front porch on summer afternoons, plying her
knitting needles and stretching her aged legs in the warm sunlight.
"'twas a long time ago, honey," she observed when talk of slavery days
was brought up, "but i 'members as ef 'twas yestidy. my ol' mistus was
de widder day. she owned a plantation clos't to lafayette an' she was
mighty good to us niggers.
"ol' mistus boughten me when i was jus' a little tyke, so i don't
'member 'bout my pappy an' mammy.
"honey, i 'members dat us little chilluns didn't go to de fiel's twel us
was big 'nuff to keep up a row. de oberseer, marse joe harris, made us
work, but he was good to us. ol' mistus, she wouldn't let us wuk whin it
was rainin' an' cold."
asked about pleasures of the old plantation life, she chuckled and
recalled:
"i kin heah de banjers yit. law me, us had a good time in dem
days. us danced most eb'ry sattidy night an' us made de rafters shake
wid us foots. lots o' times ole missus would come to de dances an'
look on. an' whin er brash nigger boy cut a cute bunch uv steps, de
menfolks would give 'im a dime or so.
"honey, us went t' de church on a sundays. i allus did lak
singin' and i loved de ol' songs lak, 'ol' ship of zion,' an' 'happy
land.' ol' mistus useter take all de little scamps dat was too little
for church an' read de book to dem under de big oak tree in de front
yahd."
"aunt hattie," she was asked, "do you remember anything about the war
between the states?"
"you mean de yankees, honey?"
"yes, the yankees."
her coal black face clouded.
"dey skeered us nearly to death," she began. "dey drap right outen de
sky. ol' mistus keep hearin' dey was comin', but dey didn't nebber show
up. den, all ter once, dey was swarmin' all ober de place wid deir blue
coats a-shinin' an' deir horses a'rarin'.
"us chilluns run en hid in de fence corners en' behin' quilts
dat was hangin' on de line. an' honey, dem yankees rid deir horses rat
onto ol' mistus flower beds. dey hunted de silver, too, but us done
hid dat.
"i 'members dey was mad. dey sot de house a-fire an' tuk all de
vittals dey could fin'. i run away an' got los', an' whin i come back
all de folks was gone."
'aunt' hattie said she "wint down de big road an' come to a lady's house
where she remained until she married.
"us moved to lafayette an' den to opelika," she concluded, "an' i bin'
here eber since."
she lives with one of her numerous granddaughters now. she finds her
great happiness in "de promise" and the moments when she can sit in the
shade and dip her mind back into memory.
wadley "shorty" clemons
interview with wadley "shorty" clemons
—g.l. clark
he was bent over the lawn, carefully trimming the border into a neat
line. a small black figure in overalls, clean but worn blue chambray
shirt, the misshapen remains of shoes and a nondescript hat, from under
which protruded thin white sideburns.
"good morning, uncle," i said, "mr. lee was telling me about you. he
said you lived back in slavery times. is that right?"
"yes suh, i sho' did. i'll be  years old de second of august, and i
was a slave for  year. i had a good ole massa and mistis, de bes' dere
was. ole massa was a great big man, an' he wa'n't scared of nothin' dey
was. he wouldn't go nowhere without me. he always took me wid him. my
grandma was a cook and my ma was a house girl.
"we lived in pine hill, a summer resort in jefferson county, georgia,
across the river from louisville. from home we could look over and see
de people walkin' about in louisville.
wadley (shorty) clemons, [tr: village springs?], alabama
"i remembers de day de yankees come to louisville. we could see them
goin' about from one house to anudder, settin' fire. den dey come on to
de river and sot fire to de bridge. dey wouldn't use our bridge. dey
built dese here pontoon bridges and dey could build dem before you could
look away and look back. den dey come across de river to pine hill.
"ole massa had his hosses an' mules hid down in de swamp but my uncle
tom went and got 'em an' brung 'em to de yankees at de big gate. he
didn't had to do it. he was jes' mean. he hadn't been much good to massa
since de war commenced; lay off in de swamp mos' of de time. arter he
brung massa's hosses an' mules to de yankees he went wid dem into
massa's bedroom and dey jes' throwed massa and mistis close all outa' de
closet and wardrobe and he give em' mistis gold yearings and bracelets
and dey took de yearings and put dem on de hosses' years and put de
bracelets on de hosses' ankles.
"ole massa was sittin' on de long porch smokin' one of dese meerschaum
pipes wid a stem way so long and dat pipe was white as snow. he had a
big can of tobacco on de table in front of him. in dem days people made
dey own tobacco and i wisht i had some of it now.
"massa had 'bout thutty fattening hogs and de yankees jes' went in de
pen and cut dem hogs in two. he had jes' lots of turkeys and guineas an'
de yankees shot dem down. he had thutty hives of bees in one long row
an' one yankee run up to de firs' hive an jump in it head first, and de
bees stung him till he died. de udders pull him out and took him to de
well and poured water over him but he stayed dead so dey just dug a hole
down by the side of the road and bury him in it. yessir, dat's de trufe!
"dey stayed dere all night and camped out and cooked massa's good smoked
meat and burnt down de barns and done all de devilment dey could. i
couldn't see no use in dere doin' what dey did, but dat's what dey done.
"massa had  slaves when dey was made free. de next county wasn't fit
for much farming and atter we was freed my uncle andy went dere an'
bought a place. de land sold for  cents de acre atter de timber was
cut off. uncle andy had a brudder sam and sam had a steer. dey plowed
wid de steer.
"uncle andy worked at de sawmill in daytime an' at night he cut two
cords of wood before he go to bed. he make two bales of cotton de first
year and de next year he make four. den he tuk up preachin'. he was a
methodist preacher.
"den ole massa die and ole mistis lose all her land. uncle andy was
right good fixed so he took keer of her a year or more 'fore she died.
den when she died, he went to pay all de expenses of de funeral but de
white folks won't let him kase dey say he done his share already.
"my massa's name was william clemons and dey name me wadley for ole man
wadley, de president of de center road.
"dem days is gone a long time an' i still heah, but dey was good times
den. i had plenty to eat, plenty close to wear and when i gets sick, ole
massa come to give me some medicine and i don't need no doctor.
"people worship god in dem days and not bother wid church houses so
much. ev'ry sunday ole massa get out by de back do' and teach us sunday
school. den we cut tree limbs and make brush arbors for preaching. in de
summer atter crops been laid by, us all, black and white, go to camp
meetin' and stay a week. de white preacher preach on one side and de
nigger on de udder. we carry lots of vittles and feed everybody. niggers
sho' was better off in slavery times."
william colbert
interview with william colbert
—john morgan smith
"sho. i remember de slavery days. how could i forgits?"
slowly uncle will spoke these words as he made his way up a few rickety
steps with the aid of an old broomstick to his cabin door. "we can jes'
set in de swing effen you wants to hear a little 'bout dem ole days,
kaze i can sho tell it."
"well, first, uncle will, what's your full name and where are you from?"
"my name am william colbert and i'se fum georgia. i was bawn in  on
my massa's plantation in fort valley. my massa's name was jim hodison.
at one time he had  of us niggers."
uncle will, a gaunt, black figure with two weeks growth of gray hair
upon his face, spoke in a soft, quaking voice scarcely audible ten feet
away. his eyes had a far-off, sad expression of one who had known
suffering. they were set deep back in bony caverns.
"well, uncle will, tell me something about the slave days. was your
master good to you?"
william colbert, [tr: birmingham], alabama
"nawsuh, he warn't good to none of us niggers. all de niggers 'roun'
hated to be bought by him kaze he was so mean. when he was too tired to
whup us he had de oberseer do it; and de overseer was meaner dan de
massa. but, mister, de peoples was de same as dey is now. dere was good
uns and bad uns. i jus' happened to belong to a bad un. one day i
remembers my brother, january was cotched ober seein' a gal on de next
plantation. he had a pass but de time on it done gib out. well suh, when
de massa found out dat he was a hour late, he got as mad as a hive of
bees. so when brother january he come home, de massa took down his long
mule skinner and tied him wid a rope to a pine tree. he strip' his shirt
off and said:
"'now, nigger, i'm goin' to teach you some sense.'
"wid dat he started layin' on de lashes. january was a big, fine lookin'
nigger; de finest i ever seed. he was jus' four years older dan me, an'
when de massa begin a beatin' him, january neber said a word. de massa
got madder and madder kaze he couldn't make january holla.
"'what's de matter wid you, nigger' he say. 'don't it hurt?'
"january, he neber said nothin', and de massa keep a beatin' till little
streams of blood started flowin' down january's chest, but he neber
holler. his lips was a quiverin' and his body was a shakin', but his
mouf it neber open; and all de while i sat on my mammy's and pappy's
steps a cryin'. de niggers was all gathered about and some uv 'em
couldn't stand it; dey hadda go inside dere cabins. atter while,
january, he couldn't stand it no longer hisself, and he say in a hoarse,
loud whisper:
"'massa! massa! have mercy on dis poor nigger.'
will's eyes narrowed down to fine creases as his thick lips came
together in smacking noises, and the loose skin beneath his chin, and
jaws seemed to shake with the impact of dread memories.
"den," he continued, after a brief pause in which time there was no
sound except the constant drop of a bead of water in a lard bucket, "de
war came. de yankees come in and dey pulled de fruit off de trees and
et it. dey et de hams and cawn, but dey neber burned de houses. seem to
me lak dey jes' stay aroun' long enough to git plenty somp'n t'eat, kaze
dey lef' in two or three days, an' we neber seed 'em since. de massa had
three boys to go to war, but dere wasn't one to come home. all the
chillun he had was killed. massa, he los' all his money and de house
soon begin droppin' away to nothin'. us niggers one by one lef' de ole
place and de las' time i seed de home plantation i was a standin' on a
hill. i looked back on it for de las' time through a patch of scrub
pines and it look' so lonely. dere warn't but one person in sight, de
massa. he was a-settin' in a wicker chair in de yard lookin' out ober a
small field of cotton and cawn. dere was fo' crosses in de graveyard in
de side lawn where he was a-settin'. de fo'th one was his wife. i lost
my ole woman too  years ago, and all dis time, i's been a carrin' on
like de massa—all alone."
tildy collins
interview with tildy collins
—susie r. o'brien, uniontown, alabama
in the negro section of uniontown, locally known as "rabbit yard" (named
by the negroes themselves), lives "aunt tildy" collins, a typical "black
mammy" of orthodox type. she is a talkative old soul, running over with
slavery tales and greatly beloved by a wide range of acquaintances among
both races. although eighty-four summers have passed over her snow-white
head, aunt tildy's spirit is unconquered by time and her physical
activity is truly remarkable for her age. she does her own housework and
cares for her home without assistance. in front of her one-room cabin is
a neat garden of vegetables and flowers combined, with morning glories
trained carefully over the fence nearly all the way around. there is a
saying in the south, that cotton will grow better for a negro than for
any other race, and this might well be extended to include morning
glories in aunt tildy's case; since none in uniontown are quite so fine
in growth or brilliance of coloring.
like nearly all old negroes, aunt tildy goes to sleep very readily. she
was dozing in a rocker on her small porch, while the scent of wood smoke
and the odor of boiling vegetables issued from the cabin. an iron pot,
hanging from a crane in the fireplace, sending forth clouds of steam and
an appetizing aroma. she clings to old fashioned equipment and disdains
a stove for cooking. her "biled" vegetables or meats in the hanging pot,
with baked potatoes and "pone" bread from the oven make up a meal that
leaves little to be desired, as many visitors who have shared her
repasts well know.
as the gate squeaked, aunt tildy awoke with a start and a smile.
"come in, white folks, i was jes' a-settin' here waitin' for my greens
to bile, an' i musta drapped off to sleep. set down in dat cheer right
dar, an' tek off your hat; you sho' is lookin' well, an' i'se proud to
see you.
"yas, ma'am, i sho' was borned in slavery times, an' i wish to gawd i
could git now what i useter hab den, 'caze dem was good times for de
black folks. dese free niggers don't know what 'tis to be tuk good keer
of.
"co'se i means dat! i was borned on a big plantation near 'bout to
linden, an' my ole marster was name harris, yassum, dick harris, an' my
ole mistis was miss mandy. bofe dey boys fit in de wah, an' i 'members
when dey went off wid de sojers, ole mistis she cry an' hug dem boys an'
kiss 'em goodbye, an' dey was gone a long time. i was a leetle gal
whenst dey went to de wah, an' i was mos' a grown 'oman when dey come
home, an' dey bofe had whiskers. young massa richard he limpin' an' look
mighty pale, an' dey say he been wounded an' stay in prison on mister
johnson's island, summuz up de ribber; but marse willis, he look all
right, 'cep'in' whiskers. ole marster had a big house, an' dat same
house standin' dar right now. us had plenty to eat an' plenty to wear,
an' dat's mo'n what some folks got now.
"ole marster was good to all he niggers, an' my pappy and mammy bofe
belonged to him. dey was a slave-yard in uniontown, an' ev'y time a
spec'later cum wid a lot of new niggers, ole marster he buy four or five
niggers, an' dat's how he come to buy my pappy, atter de spec'later
brung him an' a whole passel of niggers from north c'lina. my mammy here
already 'long to ole marster. her was borned his'n.
"sometime a no 'count nigger tek an' runned erway; but de oberseer, he
put de houn's on he track, an' dey run him up a tree, an' de oberseer
fetch him back nex' mawnin', all tuckerd out, an' he' glad to stay home
for a spell an' 'have hese'f. ole marster had a good oberseer, too.
'cose he wan't no quality, lak ole marster an' ole mistis, but he was a
good, kin' man an' he didn't hab no trouble on de whole plantation.
"us alluz had a chris'mus tree in de quarter, jes' lak de white folks
an' dey was presents for ev'ybody—nobody wan't lef' out, big or little.
dere was a meetin' house on de plantation an' ole marster had a rule dat
all de chilluns had to go to sunday school soon as dey was big 'nuff,
an' dey had to go in clean white clo'se, too. us chilluns hate to see
sunday come, 'caze mammy an' granmammy dey wash us an' near 'bout rub de
skin off gittin' us clean for sunday school, an' dey comb our heads wid
a jimcrow. you ain't neber seed a jimcrow? hit mos' lak a card what you
card wool wid. what a card look lak? humph! missy, whar you been
raise—ain't neber seed a card? dat jimcrow sho' did hurt, but us
hadder stan' hit, an' sometimes atter all dat, mammy she wrap our kinky
hair wid t'read an' twis' so tight us's eyes couldn't hardly shet.
"my granmammy, her de head cook 'oman at de big house, an' us had to
mine her lak us did mammy. i ho'p granmammy in de kitchen, atter i got
big 'nuff an' she sho' did keep me humpin'. chilluns had to mine dey
olders in dem days. dey wan't lak dey is now, don't mine nobody, not
eben dey pa.
"when de surrender come, ole marster he tole all de niggers dey was free
now, an' some was glad an' some was sorry an' welst dey might be sorry,
iffen dey knowed what a hard time dey goner had knockin' 'roun' de worl'
by deyself; no ole marster an' no ole mistis ter look atter 'em an' feed
'em when dey sick an' when dey well. look lak ter me, when de surrender
parted de white folks an' de black folks, it hurt 'em bofe. dey oughter
be tergedder, jes' lak de good lord 'tended dey be."
aunt tildy sighed deeply and, gazing afar off, said: "iffen ole marster
was livin' now, i'd be all right an' not hafter worry 'bout nuffin."
in spite of her eighty-four years, aunt tildy makes her living as a
mid-wife and serves as a "doctor man" in cases of minor ailments; but
her practice is so closely interwoven with "conju'in'" that it is
difficult to say which is the more important to her. for example: she
prescribes wearing matches in the hair or a little salt on the mole of
the head for headache. her sovereign remedy for rheumatism is "'nint de
j'ints wid a little kerosene oil an' put some mullen leaves on it." "a
good dost of turpentine is good for mos' anything de matter wid you." a
coin with a hole in it, usually a dime, tied around the ankle will keep
you from getting "pizen." furthermore, this same treatment warns against
the ill effects of getting "conju'ed." "iffen you gits conju'ed, de dime
turn black, an' you kin go to de conju' doctor an' git de conju' took
off."
"is you got to go, missy? come back agin. i's allus proud to see you,"
aunt tildy called after me from the edge of the porch.
sara colquitt
interview with sara colquitt
—preston klein, opelika, alabama
sara colquitt, who used to till the fields in slavery days, now has a
handmaiden of her own. sara does not know the date of her birth in
richmond, virginia, but she says it was more than a century ago. ().
the "girl," whom her daughter has employed to take care of the nearly
blind and helpless centenarian, is well past eighty herself, yet she
keeps her charge neat and clean and the cabin in which they live tidy.
sara's daughter works in the fields nearby at opelika, ala. to keep the
family going.
"mr. bill slaughter and miss mary slaughter was our marster and mistess
and dey had two chilluns, marsa robert and marsa brat," sara said. "i
had four brothers and sisters, tate, sam, jennie, and tenner. us lived
in log cabins wid dirt floors and dey was built in two long rows. us
beds was nailed to de wall at one end and us used corn shucks and pine
straw for mattresses.
"miss mary was good to us, but us had to work hard and late. i worked in
de fields every day from 'fore daylight to almost plumb dark. i usta
take my littlest baby wid me. i had two chilluns, and i'd tie hit up to
a tree limb to keep off de ants and bugs whilst i hoed and worked de
furrow. all us niggers was fed from de big kitchen and wasn't hongry,
but sometimes us would steal more food dan was give us anyhow.
sara colquitt, opelika, alabama
"i was one of de spinners, too, and had to do six cuts to de reel at de
time and do hit at night plenty times. us clothes was homespun osnaburg,
what us would dye, sometimes solid and sometimes checked.
"'sides working de fields and spinning, sometimes i'd ho'p wid de
cooking up at de big house when de real cook was sick or us had a passel
of company. us cooked on a great, big fireplace what had arms hanging
out over de coals to hang pots on to bile. den us had three-legged
skillets what set right over de coals for frying and sech like. us
cooked sho' 'nuff bread in dem days, ash cakes, de best thing you ever
et. dey ain't nothing like dat dese days.
"i was sold oncet before i left virginia. den i was brung down to
alabama and sold from de block for $, to mr. sam rainey, at camp
hill, ala. i still worked in de fields, but i would cook for de white
folks and hope around de big house on special 'casions. our overseer was
mr. green ross, and he was a bad one, too. mean, my goodness! he'd whup
you in a minute. he'd put you in de buck, tie your feet and den set out
to whup you right.
"he would get us slaves up 'fore day, blowing on his big horn, and us
would work 'twell plumb dark. all de little niggers'd get up, too, and
go up to de big house to be fed from wooden bowls. den dey'd be called
ag'in 'fore us come from de fields and put to bed by dark. i useta stop
by de spring house to get de milk, it was good cold too, and tote it up
to de big house for dinner.
"i had two chilluns. dey was named lou and eli, and dey was took care of
like de rest. us useta have some good times. us could have all de fun us
wanted on sa'dday nights, and us sho' had it, cutting monkeyshines and
dancing all night long sometimes. some would pat and sing, 'keys not
arunning, keys not arunning," and us sho' did more'n dance, i'm telling
you. sometimes our mistess would come down early to watch us dance.
"next to our dances, de most fun was corn-shucking. marsa would have de
corn hauled up to de cribs and piled as a house. den he would invite de
hands 'round to come and ho'p shuck it. us had two leaders or generals
and choose up two sides. den us see which side would win first and
holler and sing. i disremembers the hollers jest now. my mind is sorter
missing. marsa would pass de jug 'round, too. den dey sho' could work
and dat pile'd just vanish.
"us used de white folks' church in de morning. i j'ined de church den,
'cause i always tried to live right and wid de lord.
"when de yankees come through dadeville, ala., us heard 'bout hit and
marsa hid his money and lots of his fine things in de colored folks's
houses. dey never found 'em neither.
"lemme see who i married? i mighty nigh forgot who it was i did marry.
now, i knows. hit was prince hodnett.
"no'm, i don't want no more slavery. i hope dey don't have no more such,
'cause hit was terrible.
"yes'm, i'd be proud to have my picture took."
so pridefully sara's chair was dragged out on the porch by her maid, and
the "picture was took."
mandy mccullough cosby
interview with mandy mccullough cosby
—margaret fowler, fruithurst, alabama
mandy mccullough cosby puffed reflectively at her mellowed corncob pipe
and began her story:
"my massa, bryant mccullough, was a chambers county man. he had so many
slaves i can't tell you de numbah. he didn't know hisself how many he
had. i is now ninety-five years old an' what i remembers mos' is de way
de chillun roll aroun' in de big nurses room." mandy lives at -pine
street, anniston, alabama. she was cutting collards for dinner and left
her dishpan and butcher knife to receive her caller.
"mist' mccullough, he raised niggahs to sell—an' the little black
chillen play aroun' until 'bout sundown, dey is give dey supper. a long
trough out in a cool place in the bak yard is filled wif good, cold
buttermilk an' cornbread crumbed in, an' dey each is give a spoon, an'
dey eats dey fill. den dey is ready fo' bed. some of dem jes' fall ovah
on de groun', asleep, and is picked up, and put on dey pallet in de big
chillens room. dey was old woman called de nurse, look after 'em. dey
git good care fo' de master expects dey will bring good money.
"ol' miss, she don't lak to see dem sold, an' she cry ever' time, she so
tender-hearted. but mist' mccullough is jes' lak mens is today. he jes'
laugh an' go on.
"but he was good to his black folks. folks called us 'mccullough's free
niggers.' wasn't much whippin' went on 'roun' our plantation, but on
some places close to us, they whipped until blood run down. some places
they even mixed salt an' pepper in water an' bathed 'em with it. the
salt water'd heal, but when the pepper got in there, it burned lak fire,
an' they'd as well get on to work quick, cause they can't be still
nohow.
"one woman, on a plantation not so far from us, was expectin', an' they
tied her up under a hack-a-berry tree, an' whipped her until she died.
mos' any time at night ef you go 'roun' that tree, you could hear that
baby cry. i 'spect you could hear it yet.
"everybody said that was murder, an' that something ought to be done
about it, but nothin' ever was.
"mist' mccullough always give his folks plenty of sumpin' t'eat an' then
he say, 'i's lookin' for plenty uv work.' 'niggahs fat an' greasy can't
do nothin' but work.
"my mother was a loomer. she didn't do nothin' but weave. we all had
reg'lar stints of spinnin' to do, when we come from the fiel'. we set
down an' eat a good supper, an' ever'night until ten o'clock we spin
cuts of cotton, an' reel the tread, an' nex' day, the rolls is carded
an' packed in a basket to be wove.
"spinnin' wheels was in every cabin. dere was so many of us to be tuk
care of, it took lots of spinnin'."
emma crockett
interview with emma crockett
—ruby pickens tartt, livingston, alabama
on the old east road from livingston to epes, about six miles north-east
of livingston, is the "double house" built of widely assorted materials,
where emma crockett lives. the older part of the house is the "settin'
room" where the stick-and-clay chimney of its earlier days has been
replaced by a new brick chimney. a roof of corrugated sheet metal tops
the warped, roughly hewn logs which form the walls. the "new room" is
built in the later shanty style—pine boards, unplaned, and nailed
upright to a frame of x's, the cracks of the flat joints "stripped"
with narrow siding. a roof of "bought" shingles covers this room.
connecting the two rooms is an open hall roofed with heavy boards
"rived" from pine blocks. despite its conglomerate architecture this is
a better "colored folks'" house than many in the black belt. these
"double houses" often have no roof for the hall and some also lack a
floor, the hall being made entirely of earth, sky and imagination.
emma settled herself on the top step at the front of the hall to talk to
me, after first ironing a tiny wrinkle out of her "string apron" with
her hand.
emma crockett, livingston, alabama
"miss, i'm 'bout sebenty-nine or eighty year old," she told me, "and i
belonged to marse bill hawkins and miss betty. i lived on deir
plantation right over yander. my mammy was called cassie hawkins and my
pappy was alfred jolly. i was emma jolly 'fore i married old henry
crockett. us had five chillun and dey's two of 'em livin' in bummin'ham,
fannie and mary.
"sometimes i kain't git my min' together so as i kin tell nothin'. i
fell out t'other day and had a misery in my head ever since. i wish i
could read, but i wa'n't never l'arnt nothin' 'ceptin' atter surrender
miss sallie cotes she showed us how to read printin'; but i kain't read
no writin. i kain't tell you so much 'bout de wah' ca'se my recollection
ain't no 'count dese days. all i knowed, 'twas bad times and folks got
whupped, but i kain't say who was to blame; some was good and some was
bad. i seed the patterollers, and atter surrender de ku kluxes dey come
den, but didn't never bother me. see, i wan't so old and i minded
ev'ybody, and didn't vex 'em none. us didn't go to church none, but i

"but i didn't never fool wid no hoodoo and no animal stories neither. i
didn't have no time for no sich foolishness. and i ain't scared of
nothin' neither.
"i lives here wid my grandchile now on mr. bob davis' place. us gits

cheney cross
interview with cheney cross
—annie d. dean
from all accounts, aunt cheney cross must be quite ninety years old. "in
jewin' de war," she says, "i had done long pass my thirteenth birthday."
today aunt cheney is a true reflection of slavery days and the southern
mammy.
away from highways and automobiles, she lives several miles from
evergreen on a small farm in the piney woods with her "baby boy."
talk with aunt cheney reveals that evergreen's city marshall, harry l.
riley, "put out to hope" this old family servant who had "tended" to his
father, george riley; his mother, "miss narciss," and "miss lizzible,"
his sister. she also helped bring his own "chillun" into the world.
aunt cheney had promised mr. riley that she would come in town on a
certain saturday morning in may, , and would bring a letter from her
young "mistis" for me to read.
it was past noon on that particular saturday when she came up the back
steps, a little out of breath, but smiling. "lawd, honey," she said,
"here 'tis pas' dinner time an' i'se jes' makin' my arrivement here.
no'm, i don't wants no dinner, thank you jes' de same. whut makes me so
late here now, i stopped by miss ella northcutt's. she's my folks too,
you know, an' she done made me eat all i kin hole! no'm, honey, i can't
eat no cabbage. me an' cabbage never is set horses together much, but i
will thank you for the ice tea."
settling herself down in a low chair, she sighed and began taking off
her shoes. "honey, you don't mind ef i resses my feets does you? my
white folks is sp'ilin' me here today. i'll be lookin' for it
tomorrrow, too, an' i won't be gittin' it." her black eyes twinkled in
her shiny, old, wrinkled face as she talked on.
"i tole mr. harry i'se comin'. an' here i is! how'd i come? i come on
mack and charlie, dat's how! yes, ma'am! dese two boys here, dey brung
me." pushing her feet out for inspection, she leaned forward, smiling
and pleased. "dese here foots, dey's mack an' charlie. dey's my whole
pennunce for gittin' about. don't you worry none. mr. harry he'll git be
back home 'gainst dark come on.
"lawd, honey, i don't want to know no better folks'n mr. harry an' miss
emma. i follow dem good folks clean up to muscle show! yessum, i sho'
did. at fust, i tole'm i couldn't go nohow. but dey pull down on me so
hard, look lack i couldn't he'p myself.
"i stayed on up dere at muscle show twell i got so homesick to see my
baby boy i couldn't stan' it no mo'. now, cose, my baby boy he was den
de father of his own, a boy an' a girl, but to me dat boy is still jes'
my baby, an' i had to come on home."
aunt cheney's little, old body shook with laughter as she leaned back
and said: "yes, ma'am! i ain't been home no time atall neither, 'twell
here come mr. harry back to evergreen wid his own self. yes, lawd! i kin
see'm now, comin' up de big hardwood road, his haid raired back,
asmokin' a sugarette lack he's a millinery! lawd, lawd! me nor mr. harry
neither one ain't never gona be contentious nowheres but right here. an'
dat's de gawd's trufe!
"iffen mr. harry hadn't come on back here, i never woulda seed no
pension. dat's de gawd's trufe, too. nobody here didn't know my eggzack
age, cause dis wasn't my originally home. all dem whut did know close
onto my age done died out an' i knows it. so when mr. harry put out to
hope me, i says in my heart 'thank gawd!'
"i tole mr. harry dat iffen anybody in de world knowed my age, it was my
young mistis, an' i didn't know eggzackly where she at, but her papa was
captain purifire (purifoy). back yonder he was de madistra of our town,
an' he had all of dem lawin' books. i figgered dat my birthright would
be down in one of dem books. i knowed in reason dat my mistis still got
dem books wid her, 'cause dey ain't been no burnin's dat i done heard
about. i knowed, too, dat mr. harry was gona fine out where she at.
"i 'members captain purifire jes' lack a book. i does dat! now, cose,
when he come on in home from de war he didn't 'zackly favor hisse'f den,
'cause when i seed him comin' roun' de house he look so ragged an'
ornery i tuck him for de ole bad man hisse'f. i tuck out behind de smoke
house, an' when i got a good look at him th'ew a crack it look lack i
could recognize his favor, but i couldn't call his name to save my life.
lawd, honey! he's a sight! all growed over an' bushy! you couldn't tell
iffen he's man or beas'. i kep' on alookin' whilst he's comin' roun' de
corner, an' den i heard him say 'cheney, dat you?' i'se so happy, i jes'
melt down."
aunt cheney was really living over her past. "you see, it's
lack dis," she said: "my fore parents, dey was bought. my mistis
an' my daddy's mistis, too, was miss mary fields, an' my daddy was
henry fields. den de carters bought my daddy from miss mary fields.
well, dey mix up an' down lack dat, twell now my young mistis, what
used to be little frances purifire, she's married to mr. cunningham.
"i was brung up right in de house wid my white folks. yessum, i slep' on
de little trundler bed what pushed up under de big bed, in durinst de
day. i watched over dem chillun day an' night. i washed 'em an' fed
'em an' played wid 'em. one of de babies had to take goat's milk. when
she cry, my mistis say, 'cheney, go on an' git dat goat.' yes lawd! an'
dat goat sho' did talk sweet to dat baby! jes' lack it was her own. she
look at it an' wag her tail so fas' an' say: "ma-a-a-a-a!" den she lay
down on de flo' whilst us holes her feets an' let de baby suck de milk.
all de time dat goat bees talkin', 'ma-a-a-a-a,' twell dat baby got
satchified.
"when us chillun got tuck wid any kind of sickness or zeezes, us tuck
azzifizzity an' garlit. you know, garlit what smell lack onions. den we
wore some roun' us necks. dat kep' off flu-anz.
"dese days it look lack somepin t'eat don't tas'e lack dat we cooked
back yonder. de coffee us used had to be fresh groun' ever' day. an'
when it commence to bile, i put dese here knees down on de flo' befo' de
fire an' stir dat coffee for de longes'. den my gran'ma she hung dat pot
up on dem pot hooks over de fire an' washed de meat an' drap it in. time
she done pick an' overlook de greens an' den wrinched 'em in spring
water, de meat was bilin'. den she take a great big mess of dem fresh

to seasonin'.
"nex' thing i knowed, here come my mistis, an' she say: 'now cheney, i

was all time ready an' hot. they wouldn't be no finger prints lef' on
dat pone when cheney got th'ew pattin' it out neither. better not! look
lack dem chillun jes' couldn't git 'nuff of dat hard corn bread.
"plenty of fancy cookin' went on 'roun' dat fire place, but somehow de
pot licker an' pone bread longside wid de fresh buttermilk stirs my
mem'ry worse'n anything.
"all dis good eatin' i'se speakin' 'bout tuck place befo' de yankees
raided us. it was den, too, dat my mistis tuck me down to de spring back
of de house. down dere it was a holler tree stump, taller'n you is. she

"yes honey, i 'members dat yankee raid lack it was jes' yistiddy. i'se

chicken better not pass by. iffen he do, off come his head!
"when dey pass on by me, dey put' nigh shuck me outa my skin. 'where's

twell my eye balls loosen up. 'where's de silver?' lawd! was my teefs

"dey tuck dem enfield rifles, half as long as dat door, an' bus' in de

"yes, lawd! dem yankees loaded up a waggin full of meat an' tuck de

"dey didn't cut no mo' mattrusses. an' dey didn't cut nothin' much up in
de parlor, 'cause dat's where de lieutenant an' de sargeant slep'. but
dey lef' de nex' day, de whole place was strewed wid mutilation.
"i 'members well back dere in jewin' de war how ever' oncet a month that

"directly atter de surrender, de ku kluxes sho' was bad atter de

tyin' grape vines crost de road, to git 'em tangled up an' make 'em trip

"'long about den, too, seem lack ha'nts an' spairits was ridin'

wid him. i hates to leave my mistis, an' she didn't want to part from
me. she say: 'stay here wid me, an' i'll give you a school learnin'.'
she say to captain purifire: 'you go buy my li'l nigger a book. git one
of dem blue back websters,' she say, 'so i kin eddicate her to spell.'
den my daddy say: 'her mamma tole me not to come home widout her an' she

"i never will fergit ridin' behin' my daddy on dat mule way in de night.

matilda pugh daniel
interview with matilda pugh daniel
—gertha couric
near eufaula, alabama, on a bluff stands a little three room cabin
neatly furnished with plain, well worn, but nicely kept furniture.
surrounding the house are small beds of pretty flowers, and rows of
fresh vegetables. here resides in peace and tranquility aunt matilda
pugh daniel, an old negro slave, aged  years. aunt matilda was a full
grown buxom gal when the war between the states was raging. she belonged
to united states senator, james l. pugh, and was born on his plantation,
near eufaula. even though time has dimmed her sight, and slightly
diminished her hearing powers, she is still active of mind and accurate
in her memories. we will let her speak for herself:
"yassuh, white folks, i remembers lots of things dat happen in de
slabery times. i works aroun' de house for mistis, who was de daughter
of gen'l john linguard hunter befo' she ma'ied de massa. when i was a
little pig-tailed nigger, i usta play 'roun' wid massa's chilluns. we
play injuns in de woods, an' buil' dams down on de creek an' swing in de
yard an' sometime we sho do devilish things. we hid red pepper in ole
black bob's chewin' bacca, an' you ought to seed de faces he made. it
makes me laugh still yit. den we tuken a skunk dat us little white an'
black debils kotched an' turn him loose in de slave quarters. you ought
ter seed dem niggers come a flyin' outer dere. dey come out like a swarm
of wet antses.
"atter i grew up i ma'ied joe daniel, a house nigger, an' gen'l hunter,
de mistis's pappy 'formed de ceremony. we was ma'ied in de parlor, an' i
wo' a party dress of miss sara's. it sho' was purty; made outen white
tarleton wid a pink bow in de front. i had a pink ribbon 'roun' my haid
too, an' joe, he look proud of me. atter de weddin' all de niggers on de
plantation gathered about an' we had a soiree in de back yard. me an'
joe moved to de quarter den, but i still worked in de house. mistis
warn't goin' ter let nobody wash dem julep glasses but me, an' warn't
nobody a goin' ter polish dat silber but dis here nigger. nawsuh.
matilda pugh daniel, eufaula, alabama
"durin' de war us warn't bothered much, but atter de surrender, some po'
white trash tried to make us take some lan'. some of 'em come to de
slave quarters, an' talk to us. dey say 'niggers, you is jus' as good as
de white fo'ks. you is 'titled to vote in de 'lections an' to have money
same as dey,' but most of us didn't pay no 'tention to 'em.
"den massa james an' mistis moved to washington, an' miss sara wanted me
to go wid her to be her house maid. she said she'd pay me money fo' it,
but i couldn't leave my ole man, joe, kaze he had a case of consumption.
joe died a year later an' lef' me wid fo' little chilluns. us stayed
'roun' on de plantation an' de new massa paid us good money fo' workin',
but soon de house kotched fire an' burn to de groun', an' i have to move
to eufaula. i bought dis little house wid de money i saved. i has
kinfolks in detroit dat sen's me a little money, an' some good peoples
in eufaula helps me out some so i is in purty good financial shape. i
ain't neber 'sociated wid no trashy niggers an' i ain't neber 'ten' to.
i is goin' to be a proud an' good nigger to de las'."
carrie davis
interview with carrie davis
—preston klein, lee county, alabama
carrie davis said "honey, dere was a lot of cruel things done in slavery
times."
she was washing when i arrived at her shanty near smith's station,
alabama. she asked, as so many of the old negroes do, "has you come to
help me?" i said: "no, carrie; i want you to tell me about slavery."
she shook her gray head, recalled: "dem was good an' bad times, mistus;
good an' bad. i had a purty good marster; but de marster on de
plantation dat j'ined our'n was mighty mean. he was a bad man, no matter
if de slaves behaved or not.
"honey, i 'members dat he had regular days to whup all de slaves wid
strops. de strops had holes in 'em so dat dey raised big blisters. den
dey took a hand saw, cut de blisters and washed 'em in salt water. our
ol' mistus has put salve on aheap of backs so dey could git deir shirts
off. de shirts'd stick, you see. de slaves would come to our house for
water an' mistus would see 'em."
asked about her life as a slave, she said: "i was borned in harris
county, georgia, an' was 'bout ten or twelve when freedom come. my mammy
an' pappy was martha an' nathan perry and had seben chillun. besides me,
dere was amy, ida, knoxie, jim, abraham, an' franklin.
"us lived in de perry quarters. de cabins was made of split logs, put up
edgeways and daubed wid mud inside an' out. dey was 'bout a hundred
yards from de big house, whar marster billy an' mistus nancy perry
lived. deir chillun was clara maria, malinda, sara, alec, jim, an' bill.
dey was real good to us, too. us et at de big house. 'course de food was
cooked on de fireplace, but us had meat and greens but not much
biscuits. us had collards an' cabbage, too.
"sometimes us would have wild game, 'ca'se de men hunted lots an'
kotched rabbits, 'possums and coons. dey also kotched a lot of fish.
"no'm, our beds warn't so good. dey was homemade and de sides was
scantlings wid legs nailed on. den slats was nailed on top of it to put
our shuck-and-straw mattresses on.
"my grand-parents was from virginny. when i was a slave i was used as a
house-girl and to help keep de yards clean and bring in water. us wore
mostly slips, wove in homemade looms; an' dey was osnaburg an' homespun.
we wore 'em sunday and monday de same. us shoes was made at a tanyard
and dey was brogans as hard as rocks.
"i 'members dat some of our white neighbors was poor and didn't have no
slaves. dey would help us work. de overseer couldn't whip dem, but he
would make dem work hard and late. i 'members, too, dat de overseer
waked us up wid a trumpet.
"dey useta tell us dat if us didn't work dey was going to sell us to
help feed de rest; and bless yo' soul, us niggers'd go to work, too.
marster wasn't mean. he would jest lock de slaves in de crib fer
punishment. when slaves was sold, i seed many a nigger put on de block
for five and six hundred dollars.
"us couldn't leave de plantation widout a pass; and you better not let
'em kotch you wid a book. us walked to de white church an' set in de
back. mr. davey snell preach and baptize, and dey had foot-washin's.
sometimes de niggers'd git so happy dey would shout. den dey would keep
shoutin' in de fields next day and git a whipping.
"if a nigger got out widout a pass, dey sot de hounds on you; and de
patrollers'd tear you up too, if you stayed out too late.
carrie davis, smith's station, alabama
"us had sech good times on sattidy nights; frolic, dance an'
cornshuckin's. most of 'em would be drinkin' and sing and holler:
sheep's in de cotton patch;
got 'im out monday.
had it been a white man;
got 'im out sunday.
"kid kimbrough was our leader, and he could sing 'dixie,' too.
"christmas mornin' us'd have a better breakfast and dey would give us
rations at de big house. when any of de slaves got married dey went up
to de white folks' house an' jumped over de broom. dat was de ceremony
at de weddin'. and if marster wanted to mix his stock of slaves wid a
strong stock on 'nother plantation, dey would do de mens an' women jest
lak horses. i 'members dat when two niggers married, dey got a big
supper.
"all us chilluns had a big time; played 'pretty pauline,' 'turn,
charlie,' an' sech-lak.
"no'm i never did see nor b'lieve in ghosts.
"when us got sick mistus'd give horse-mint, life-everlasting, goldenrod,
an' holly teas, yessum. and us wore asafetida and pop-ball seed.
"when de yankees come, dey handcuffed our folks and took 'em off.
marster had his meat, corn, fodder, and sech hauled in de swamp near de
plantation. dem yankees went as straight to it as if dey had seed us put
it dere. dey burned it all up and took some niggers from de other farm.
"when freedom come, i 'members dat marster told us dat us was free, but
dat we could stay on if we lacked. most of us stayed on wid him for a
spell. now and den de ku klux klan'd come around and beat on a nigger.
"i married charlie gibson and had two chillun, twelve grand-chilluns
and nine great-grandchilluns.
"honey, i's heard abraham lincoln's name, but don't know nothin' 'bout
him. i got tired livin' 'mong wicked peoples; and i wanted to be saved.
dat's why i j'ined de church and still tries to de right."
clara davis

"i was bawn in de year , white folks," said aunt clara, "on de
mosley plantation in bellvy jus' nawth of monroeville. us had a mighty
pretty place back dar. massa mosely had near 'bout five hundred acres
an' mos' near to one hundred slaves.
"was marse mosely good to us? lor', honey, how you talk. co'se he was!
he was de bes' white man in de lan'. us had eve'y thing dat we could
hope to eat: turkey, chicken, beef, lamb, poke, vegetables, fruits,
aigs, butter, milk ... we jus' had eve'y thing, white folks, eve'ything.
dem was de good ole days. how i longs to be back dar wid my ole folks
an' a playin' wid de chilluns down by de creek. 'tain't nothin' lak it
today, nawsuh. when i tell you 'bout it you gwine to wish you was dar

"white folks, you can have your automobiles an' paved streets an'
electric lights. i don't want 'em. you can have de busses an' street
cars an' hot pavements an' high buildin' 'caze i ain't got no use for
'em no way. but i'll tell you what i does want. i wants my ole cotton
bed an' de moonlight nights a shinin' through de willow trees an' de
cool grass under my feets as i runned aroun' ketchin' lightnin' bugs. i
wants to hear de sound of de hounds in de woods atter de 'possum, an' de
smell of fresh mowed hay. i wants to feel de sway of de ol' wagon
a-goin' down de red, dusty road an' listen to de wheels groanin' as dey
rolls along. i wants to sink my teeth into some of dat good ol' ash
cake, an' smack de good ol' sorghum offen my mouth. white folks, i wants
to see de boats a passin' up an' down de alabamy ribber an' hear de
slaves a singin' at dere work. i wants to see de dawn break over de
black ridge an' de twilight settle over de place spreadin' a sort of
orange hue over de place. i wants to walk de paths th'ew de woods an'
see de rabbits an' watch de birds an' listen to frogs at night. but dey
tuk me away f'om dat a long time ago. 'twern't long befo' i ma'ied an'

george dillard
interview with george dillard
—alice l. barton
george dillard, born in richmond, va., in , now idles about his
little home at eutaw and recalls days when he was a slave. the memories
bring smiles to his wrinkled, black face.
"honey, dar was a dance every sattidy night," he chuckled, "an' all de
niggers nigh 'bout broke dey legs adancin'."
"and didn't you dance just as hard as the others, uncle george?"
"well, mistus, i was right spry; but i was at my best in de job of
pickin' de banjer. i shorely did love to pick dat box while de other
niggers danced away."
george said his family came from virginia to mississippi, and that he
came to greene county about  years ago. his two masters were a mr.
dillard and bob steele.
george explained that he was a field hand and had to work hard most of
the time.
"but us had plenty to eat," he said. "de food was cooked in ol' mistus'
kitchen an' sont to de fiel' on a big cart. i 'member dat a bell would
ring for us to git up, an' we would work as long as it was daylight."
george said that mr. steele owned about  slaves and that he always
had plenty of everything. the plantation, he said, consisted of about
, acres.
"ol' massa had a church right on de plantation for us niggers," he
continued. "many's de time i danced late in de night an' den had to git
up an' go to church wid de rest. all of us had to go. a white man would
preach, but i allus enjoyed de singin' most of all."
george believes earnestly that ghosts exist, but admits they have never
bothered him.
george dillard, eutaw, alabama
"dey is all aroun'," he maintains, "but dey don't follow me. no'm, i's
not 'fraid of 'em; but i knows plenty of niggers dat'll run if a ghost
so much as brushes by 'em."
the old darkey said that "atter freedom come to de worl'" he continued
to live with his master and worked a share crop. he said that mr. steele
was always fair and good to him; always giving him the best of
everything.
george married celia shelton, and to them were born twenty-four
children.
"it was a bunch of dem," he said, "but i loved ebry one. i had a nice
weddin' an' de white folks helped me to git myself a 'oman an' then to
git married to her."
ella dilliard
personal interview with ella dilliard
 canal street, mobile, alabama
—ila b. prine
ella dilliard, an old negro woman who lives at  canal street, mobile,
says she was a small girl during slavery time, and does not know the
hardships of it, because she was owned by good people. her mother's name
was mary norris, owned by mrs. calvin norris, who lived in selma, ala.,
but had a homestead in mobile. her father belonged to people by the name
of childress, and his name was green childress. she doesn't remember
much about him because his white people took him to texas.
ella said that her mother was her madame's hairdresser, and that mrs.
norris had her mother taught in mobile. so ella's life was very easy, as
she stayed around the big house with her mother, although her
grandmother, penny anne norris, cared for her more than her mother did.
one of the things she remembers quite distinctly was her grandmother's
cooking on the fireplace, and how she would not allow any one to spit in
the fireplace. she said her grandmother made corn-pone and wrapped it in
shucks and baked it in ashes.
ella said she did not know many colored people, since the quarters were
quite a ways from the big house, and that the plantation was managed by
an overseer. she said the quarters were built in rows with streets
between them.
she also remembers the first boat she ever saw that was when she was
brought to mobile after the surrender, and when she saw the boat she
said to her mother: "look at that house sitting on the water."
ella said that there were three cooks at the big house, their names
being hannah, judy, and charlotte, and the gardener's name was uncle
john. ella also said that one thing that she remembers so well about the
kitchen in the big house was a large dishpan, that had a partition in
the middle of it, one side you washed the dishes in, and the other side
was used for scalding them.
the slaves always had saturdays to wash their clothes and do things for
themselves. ella, not having lived among negroes, does not know much
about their habits and customs, but she does remember seeing the big
white covered wagons that the slaves were carried in to be sold; and
remembers hearing talk of the "pattyrollers." she said when the slaves
were sold, they were put on a block, and that the man who were buying
would look in their mouths just like they did horses.
ella said she was born in greensboro, alabama, but the plantation where
she later lived was on the alabama river near selma, ala. she doesn't
know how many acres it comprised, or how many slaves that her master
owned. she remembers her madame made her stop calling her mother
"mammy," and her father "daddy." she said: "you know, miss, that the
white children now-a-days calls their parents 'mammy and daddy' like the
colored people used to. the children now do not respect their parents as
they should, and in fact everything is so different the truth done 'be
under the table.' you know, miss, i am telling the truth, because the
bible says, 'woe be unto the one that lies; judgment is on the land.'
"in those days people had to work to live, and they raised most
everything they used, such as cattle, hogs, cotton, and foodstuff. then
the women spun the thread out of the cotton, and wove the cloth."
ella helped her grandmother at the weaving by picking up the shuttles
for her. she said they generally used the cloth as it was woven. the
shoes were made on the place and were called red brogans.
as for the churches, the white folks had the brush arbor camp meetings,
where the people would go and camp in little cabins for weeks, so they
could attend the church. they had newspapers then, ella said, "but
'course they ain't like you have now, there warn't so many as there is
now.
"you asked something, miss, about medicines. i don't remember much about
any medicine, because mr. calvin norris was a doctor, and he always
treated us when we were sick. there was a dr. browder who 'tended the
plantation."
ella is a bright colored, small woman, whose eyes are very keen. she
says that a short time ago she had some trouble with her eyes, and she
got something from the drug store to bathe them with, but it did not
help them. so she caught some pure rain water and "anointed" her eyes
with that, and now she can see to thread a needle. her life has been
very colorful in many respects. she recalled as a small child, that,
during the war, a minie-ball came through a brick wall of the servant
house where they were living, but it fell without harming any of the
servants. she said when wilson's raid was made on selma, that the yankee
men went through the houses just like dogs, taking whatever they wanted.
"i 'members mr. parkman putting two sacks of money down in his big well,
and him getting it out with hooks after the yankees left."
later when she was brought to mobile she worked for judge oliver semmes
for twenty years. judge semmes was the son of admiral raphael semmes,
and she said he was a blessed, good man. for the past fourteen years she
has been working for the frank lyons family of mobile.
ella lives in a double tenement house, having one room and a small
kitchen. the room is full of old furniture and odd things. on the mantle
is a lovely old china pitcher that once was owned by judge semmes and
which ella prizes very much. the thing that puzzles ella most among the
modern inventions, she said, are the aeroplanes, and the way ice is
made. she said:
"miss, we never had any ice way back yonder. we had nice, old, open
brick wells, and the water was just like ice. we would draw the water
and put around the milk and butter in the dairy. it's a mystery to me
how they make that ice, but, my goodness! i guess i need not worry my
head about things, because i am not here for long. all my family is dead
and gone now, and the only companion i have is this here little white
hen. her name is mary. you see, i bought her last year to kill for
christmas, but i couldn't do it. she is so human; and you ought to see
the eggs she lays. i even have a few to sell sometimes. i just keeps
mary in the room at night with me, and she is heaps of company for me."
rufus dirt
interview with rufus dirt
—woodrow hand, birmingham, alabama
foreword: this negro, rufus dirt, was found on one of birmingham's
busiest streets begging for coins. because of his inability to read, he
was unable to give the number or location of his home. all he knew was
"jes' som'ers on southside, boss."
"i'll drop a dime in your hat uncle if you'll stand here and talk to me
for a few minutes."
"sho' boss, iffen you wants, i'll talk all day fo' dat much money. i'se
been here fo' a long time an' i knows plenty to talk 'bout. what does
yo' want to know?"
i explained my interest in slavery days and my search for ex-slaves, but
he began telling me before i had time to finish. his ability to talk had
somehow escaped what his age had done to his hair, which was sparse as
well as snowy white. his eyes were a glazy red. one hand and arm seemed
to be crippled, but the other waved around in the air as he talked and
finally settled on my shoulder.
"boss, i don' rightly know jes' how old i is. i was a driver (negro boss
of other slaves) during slavery and i reckons i was about twenty
sompin'. i don' remember nothin' in particular that caused me to get dat
drivin' job, ceptin' hard work, but i knows dat i was proud of it 'cause
i didn' have to work so hard no mo'. an' den it sorta' made de other
niggers look up to me, an' you knows us niggers, boss. nothin' makes us
happier dan' to strut in front of other niggers. dere ain't nothin' much
to tell about. we jes' moved one crop atter de other till layin' by time
come and den we'd start in on de winter work. we done jes' 'bout de same
as all de other plantations.
"my massa's name was digby and we live at tuscaloosa befo' de war. an'
'bout dat war, white folks. dem was some scary times. de nigger women
was a-feared to breathe out loud come night an' in de day time, dey
didn't work much 'cause dey was allus lookin' fo' de yankees. dey didn'
come by so much 'cause atter de first few times. dere wa'nt no reason to
come by. dey had done et up ever'thing and toted off what dey didn' eat.
dey tuk all massa's stock, burned down de smokehouse atter dey tuk de
meat out, an' dey burned de barn, an' we'all think ever' time dat dey
goin' to burn de house down, but dey musta forgot to do dat.
"when de war was finally over an' i was free, my family went to
vicksburg, mississippi where we made a livin' first one way an' den de
other. i don't know how long we stayed dere, but i was livin' in
bummin'ham when dere wa'nt nothin' much here a'tall. i watched all de
big buildin's 'round here go up and i see'd dem build all de big plants
and i'se still watchin', but i still don' know how to tell folks where
places is, 'cause i don' know how to read numbers. i goes anywhere i
wants to go an' i don't ever get lost, but jes' de same, i can't tell
nobody where i am. i don' even know where we is standin' talking like
dis right now. an' boss, i ain't beggin' 'cause i'se too lazy to work.
i'se worked plenty in my time till i crippled dis arm in de mines and
befo' my eyes got so bad," and with a grace and gentleness that may be
called a characteristic of his generation, he added, "i hope i'se told
you what you wants to know."
he had. i felt well repaid for the dime i had given him. as he walked
off down the street, i noticed for the first time the large crowd that
had gathered around us. evidently slave tales carry more interest than
this writer realized.
katherine eppes
interview with katherine eppes
—susie r. o'brien, uniontown, alabama
"ma" eppes sat on the steps of her weatherbeaten, unpainted little
cabin, duplicate of the dozens that make up rat row, negro quarter of
uniontown, and looked down the vista of memory to her childhood when she
lived in "where de log cabins stretched as far as you could see in de
slave qua'ters."
despite her eighty-seven years, katherine eppes, known to everyone as
"ma," came as spryly to her tiny porch as her rotund body would permit.
she smiled broadly at her interviewer and seated herself slowly.
"sho', honey, i can tell you mo'n anything you want to know 'bout the
big fight, 'ca'se i been here a long time," she began her story. "dey
ain't many lef' to tell 'bout dem days. my mammy an' pappy was peter an'
emma lines an' us all belonged to marsa frank and miss sarah lines. i
was born on dey plantation five miles below faunsdale 'bout  so dey
tells me.
"i is right ol' but thank gawd i still got my teefies an' my ha'r lef'."
proudly the old woman unwrapped her "head rag" to display a thick mop,
woolly white but neatly parted into squares. dozens of little plaits,
wrapped with yards of twine, just as her hair had been dressed in the
slave quarters before the war, adorned her head. she sat with uncovered
head unblinking in the bright june sunshine, as she took up the tale of
her health. "i sees pretty good, too, but i's so hebby i ain't able to
toe myse'f 'roun' as pert as i useter.
"it was diff'rent back in dem days when i belonged to rich white folks.
dey had plenty of niggers an' dey was log cabins in de quarters jes' as
far as your eyes could see. marsa frank an' miss sarah was good to de
black folks, too. dey son, young marsa frank, fit in de big war. atter
de war was over i stayed on de lines' place 'twell atter i ma'ied, an'
ol' miss gin me my weddin' dress an' a long veil down to my foots.
"when us was chillun in de quarters we did a mighty lot of playin'. us
useta play 'sail away rauley' a whole lot. us would hol' han's an' go
'roun' in a ring, gittin' faster an' faster an' dem what fell down was
outa de game.
"my mammy wukked in de big house, aspinnin' an' anussin' de white
chillun. all of dem called her 'mammy.' ah 'members one thing jes' lack
it was yestiddy. miss sarah went to 'mospolis (demopolis) to visit wid
her sister, an' whilst she were gone de oberseer, what go by de name of
allen, whupped my mammy crost her back 'twell de blood runned out.
"when miss sarah comed back an' foun' it out, she was de maddes white
lady i eber seed. she sont for de oberseer, an' she say: 'allen, what
you mean by whupping mammy? you know i don't allow you to tech my house
servants.' she jerk her dress down an' stan' dere lookin' like a sojer
wid her white shoulders shinin' lack a snow bank, an' she say: 'i
'druther see dem marks on my own shoulders dan to see 'em on mammy's.
dey wouldn't hurt me no wuss.' den she say: 'allen, teck your fambly an'
git offen my place. don't you let sundown ketch you here. 'so he lef'.
he wasn't nothin' but white trash nohow."
"ma" eppes sat silent for a time as she recalled the vision of miss
sarah standing straight and regal in her dismissal of the overseer.
finally she turned with an abrupt change of subject.
"honey, is you a christian?" she asked earnestly. "i hopes you is, ca'se
you is too fine lookin' for to go to hell. i b'longs to de baptis'
church, an' dey calls me ma eppes 'ca'se i's de mother of de church. i
loves to sing de gospel hymns."
she began to sing in a high, cracked voice, her body swaying with the
rhythm. the song rose until her neighbors had gathered to form quite an
audience. with much moaning between every line, she sang:
"i am a sojer of de cross,
a follerer of de lam'.
i'm not afeard to own his name,
nor to 'fen' his cause."
(chorus)
"i wan' you to come,
i wan' you to come,
i wan' you to come
an' be saved."
she was still singing as i left her, the neighbors joining in the
choruses. suppers would be late in the row of weatherbeaten cabins,
because the spirit of song was on the gathering.
reuben fitzpatrick
interview with reuben fitzpatrick
—[hw: mabel farrior, montgomery, alabama]
reuben fitzpatrick, of eugene street, montgomery, was born jan. , ,
( years old). he says:
"my marster was mister gholson frum bullock county. he had lots uv
slaves 'cause he was a rich man. i was jes' a boy ten years ole an' he
was a squire dat tried cases, so he rode all over de country to dif'funt
places. i rode wid him to hole his horse. he wore a high top black hat
and had a buggy wid a top dat let back. when we went we was gone a long
time an' when night come he would fix it fer me to sleep wid some uv de
niggers in de quarters where we stopped. i sho' lacked to go 'bout wid
him.
"my mother was de cook. she had rule over all the cookin'. she spinned
thread an' reeled it off too.
"when de yankees come through de country i seed 'em all runnin' so i
thought it was jedgment day an' i runned an' hid under de chimney an'
stayed dere 'tel night. dey didn't tarry long, but dey drove de horses
right up on de piazza, and throwed ever' thing out de houses, eben
knocked down de smoke 'ouse doors. dat's de trufe'.
"one time i was taken to the slave market and i was screwed on the block
and mr. martin bought me and my mamma. the man that was selling us would
holler, "who'll bid? who'll bid?" we was supposed to be spry and fidgety
so as to make the men want to buy us. my fust marster was wash jones. he
wan't good to us. he would hit us wid his cane jes' as if it had been a
switch. ben jones didn't like the way marse wash treated us niggers. he
bought us for his son.
"we didn't have no doctors much in dem days, but us had a horn us use
when we got sick. if us had the headache that horn would go right over
the spot and it wouldn't be no time 'fore the pain'd be gone. we'd use
that horn anytime we was ailing an' it'd sho' do the work. i used to
have the horn but i don't know jes' where it is now."
heywood ford
interview with heywood ford
—susie r. o'brien, uniontown, alabama
"white folks," said heywood ford, "i'se gonna tell you a story 'bout a
mean oberseer an' whut happened to him durin' de slabery days. it all
commenced when a nigger named jake williams got a whuppin' for stayin'
out atter de time on his pass done gib out. all de niggers on de place
hated de oberseer wuss dan pizen, 'caze he was so mean an' useta try to
think up things to whup us for.
"one mornin' de slaves was lined up ready to eat dere breakfas' an' jake
williams was a pettin' his ole red-bone houn'. 'bout dat time de
oberseer come up an' seed jake a pettin' his houn' an' he say: 'nigger
you ain't got time to be a-foolin' 'long dat dog. now make him git.'
jake tried to make de dog go home, but de dog didn't want to leave jake.
den de oberseer pick up a rock an' slam de dog in de back. de dog he den
went a-howlin' off.
"dat night jake he come to my cabin an' he say to me: 'heywood, i is
gonna run away to a free state. i ain't a-gonna put up wid dis treatment
no longer. i can't stand much mo'. i gibs him my han' an' i say: 'jake,
i hopes you gits dere. maybe i'll see you ag'in sometime.'
"'heywood,' he says, 'i wish you'd look atter my houn', belle. feed her
an' keep her de bes' you kin. she a mighty good possum an' coon dog. i
hates to part wid her, but i knows dat you is de bes' pusson i could
leave her wid.' an' wid dat jake slip out de do' an' i seed him
a-walkin' toward de swamp down de long furrows of cawn.
"it didn't take dat oberseer long to fin' out dat jake done run away,
an', when he did, he got out de blood houn's an' started off atter him.
it warn't long afore jake heered dem houn's a-howlin' in de distance.
jake he was too tired to go any further. he circled 'roun' an' doubled
on his tracks so as to confuse de houn's an' den he clumb a tree.
t'warn't long afore he seed de light of de oberseer comin' th'ough de
woods and de dogs was a-gittin' closer an' closer. finally dey smelled
de tree dat jake was in an' dey started barkin' 'roun' it. de oberseer
lif' his lighted pine knot in de air so's he could see jake. he say:
'nigger, come on down fum dere. you done wasted 'nuff of our time.' but
jake, he neber move nor make a sound an' all de time de dogs keppa
howlin' an' de oberseer keppa swearin'. 'come on down,' he say ag'in;
'iffen you don't i'se comin' up an' knock you outen de tree wid a
stick.' jake still he neber moved an' de oberseer den began to climb de
tree. when he got where he could almos' reach jake he swung dat stick
an' it come down on jake's leg an' hurt him tur'ble. jake, he raised his
foot an' kicked de oberseer raght in de mouf, an' dat white man went a
tumblin' to de groun'. when he hit de earth dem houn's pounced on him.
jake he den lowered hisself to de bottom limbs so's he could see what
had happened. he saw de dogs a-tearin' at de man an' he holla: 'hol'
'im, belle! hol' 'im, gal!' de leader of dat pack of houn's, white
folks, warn't no blood houn'. she was a plain old red-bone possum an'
coon dog, an' de res' done jus' lak she done, tearin' at de oberseer's
th'oat. all de while, jake he a-hollerin' f'um de tree fer dem dogs to
git 'im. 'twarn't long afore dem dogs to' dat man all to pieces. he died
raght under dat maple tree dat he run jake up. jake he an' dat coon
houn' struck off through de woods. de res' of de pack come home.
"i seed jake atter us niggers was freed. dat's how come i knowed all
'bout it. it musta been six years atter dey killed de oberseer. it was
in kentucky dat i run across jake. he was a-sittin' on some steps of a
nigger cabin. a houn' dog was a-sittin' at his side. i tells him how
glad i is to see him, an' den i look at de dog. 'dat ain't belle,' i
says. 'naw,' jake answers, 'dis her puppy.' den he tol' me de whole
story. i always did want to know what happen to 'em."
bert frederick
interview with bert frederick
—preston klein
"wants my friends to go wid me, new jerusalem;
wonder ef i'll ever git to heaven, new jerusalem!"
nappy-headed, humble little bert frederick sang the old song in a voice
that trembled and broke on the high notes. his black face beamed when he
had finished, and "de old times" came flooding back into his mind.
"honey, ol' master us'ta sing dat good song to us niggers; an' he allus
could sing it so purty."
uncle frederick, like all the other gray-bearded negroes of the old
south, is occupied mostly these days with getting ready to meet "de
sweet jesus." as well as he can remember, he was around  years old
when "de hawn of freedom sounded."
he shook his white head when the interviewer asked his age, a slow smile
spreading over his face.
"honey chile, you's axed me a riddle. i disremember 'bout dat. de bes' i
kin till you is dat i is eighty-odd—but as to 'zackness, i can't tell."
some years ago, uncle frederick suffered a broken back in an accident.
since then he has been unable to stand erect, but can straighten his
back when seated. therefore, he politely asked to sit down when he was
asked to pose for a picture.
his first master, he says, was dr. rich vernon, who lived in chambers
county. afterward, he was sold to william frederick.
he chuckled as he recalled the old days.
"i was a shirt-tail nigger," he laughed. "dat is, i wore jes' a long
shirt 'twel i was a big scamp more dan twelve year old. honey, i was a
sight to look at!
"whut did i do about de plantation? well, i driv de cows an' sheep to
pasture an' seed dat no eagles kotched de lambs. us had big eagles
'roun' den, an' us had to be keerful wid de small stock. ef us warn't,
ol' eagle ud swoop down an' tote off a whole lamb.
"us had a time in dem days. i 'members dat us had a pen to ketch wild
turkeys in. an' us kotched a few of dem, too."
uncle frederick's mother was harriett lumpkin, who lived below opelika.
he had three sisters, mary dowdell, anne carlisle and emma boyd; but all
are dead.
bert frederick, opelika, alabama
"when de yankees come to alabama," he recalled, "ol' master tol' de
niggers to hitch up all de wagons an' load all de food an' sech on 'em.
us had 'bout forty acres of swamp land, so us hid de stuff dere.
"'fore long i seed a long string of black an' white horses, wid mules
behin' dem. dey had packs on dey back. in de packs was grub de yankees
had tuk off'en de white peoples."
"did you enjoy the old slavery days, uncle?"
"yes, chile, dey was good days. some of de white peoples was bad to de
niggers, but my ol' master warn't dat kind. dat de reason he would let
all de niggers sit aroun' whilst he was a singin'; an' he could sing."
uncle frederick putters about his tiny home in opelika, managing to grow
a profusion of flowers and vegetables despite his bent back. he was
hoeing in his garden when the interviewer came upon him, but he eagerly
laid down the hoe when told what he sought.
"uncle, i want to talk with you about the old times."
"lordy me, chile," he beamed, his eyes twinkling, "you done foun' de
raght nigger!"
delia garlic
interview with delia garlic
—margaret fowler, fruithurst, alabama
delia garlic lives at  stone street, montgomery, and insists she is
 years old. unlike many of the old negroes of the south, she has no
good words for slavery days or the old masters, declaring: "dem days was
hell."
she sat on her front porch and assailed the taking of young children
from mothers and selling them in different parts of the country.
"i was growed up when de war come," she said, "an' i was a mother befo'
it closed. babies was snatched from dere mother's breas' an' sold to
speculators. chilluns was separated from sisters an' brothers an' never
saw each other ag'in.
"course dey cry; you think dey not cry when dey was sold lak cattle? i
could tell you 'bout it all day, but even den you couldn't guess de
awfulness of it.
"it's bad to belong to folks dat own you soul an' body; dat can tie you
up a tree, wid yo' face to de tree an' yo' arms fastened tight aroun'
it; who take a long curlin' whip an' cut de blood ever' lick.
"folks a mile away could hear dem awful whippings. dey was a turrible
part of livin'."
delia said she was born at powhatan, virginia, and was the youngest of
thirteen children.
"i never seed none of my brothers an' sisters 'cept brother william,"
she said. "him an' my mother an' me was brought in a speculator's drove
to richmon' an' put in a warehouse wid a drove of other niggers. den we
was all put on a block an' sol' to de highes' bidder.
"i never seed brother william ag'in. mammy an' me was sold to a man by
de name of carter, who was de sheriff of de county.
"no'm, dey warn't no good times at his house. he was a widower an' his
daughter kept house for him. i nursed for her, an' one day i was playin'
wid de baby. it hurt its li'l han' an' commenced to cry, an' she whirl
on me, pick up a hot iron an' run it all down my arm an' han'. it took
off de flesh when she done it.
"atter awhile, marster married ag'in; but things warn't no better. i
seed his wife blackin' her eyebrows wid smut one day, so i thought i'd
black mine jes' for fun. i rubbed some smut on my eyebrows an' forgot to
rub it off, an' she kotched me. she was powerful mad an' yelled: 'you
black devil, i'll show you how to mock your betters.'
"den she pick up a stick of stovewood an' flails it ag'in' my head. i
didn't know nothin' more 'till i come to, lyin' on de floor. i heard de
mistus say to one of de girls: 'i thought her thick skull and cap of
wool could take it better than that.'
"i kept on stayin' dere, an' one night de marster come in drunk an' set
at de table wid his head lollin' aroun'. i was waitin' on de table, an'
he look up an' see me. i was skeered, an' dat made him awful mad. he
called an overseer an' tol' him: 'take her out an' beat some sense in
her.'
"i begin to cry an' run an' run in de night; but finally i run back by
de quarters an' heard mammy callin' me. i went in, an' raght away dey
come for me. a horse was standin' in front of de house, an' i was took
dat very night to richmon' an' sold to a speculator ag'in. i never seed
my mammy any more.
"i has thought many times through all dese years how mammy looked dat
night. she pressed my han' in bofe of hers an' said: 'be good an' trus'
in de lawd.'
"trustin' was de only hope of de pore black critters in dem days. us
jest prayed fer strength to endure it to de end. we didn't 'spect
nothin' but to stay in bondage 'till we died.
delia garlic, montgomery, alabama
"i was sol' by de speculator to a man in mcdonough, ga. i don't
ricollect his name, but he was openin' a big hotel at mcdonough an'
bought me to wait on tables. but when de time come aroun' to pay for me,
his hotel done fail. den de atlanta man dat bought de hotel bought me,
too. 'fo' long, dough, i was sol' to a man by de name of garlic, down in
louisiana, an' i stayed wid him 'till i was freed. i was a regular fiel'
han', plowin' an' hoein' an' choppin' cotton.
"us heard talk 'bout de war, but us didn't pay no 'tention. us never
dreamed dat freedom would ever come."
delia was asked if the slaves ever had any parties or dances on her
plantation.
"no'm," she replied, "us didn't have no parties; nothin' lak dat. us
didn't have no clothes for goin' 'roun. i never had a undershirt until
jest befo' my first chil' was borned. i never had nothin' but a shimmy
an' a slip for a dress, an' it was made out'en de cheapes' cloth dat
could be bought; unbleached cloth, coarse, but made to las'.
"us didn't know nothin' 'cept to work. us was up by three or four in de
mornin' an' everybody got dey somethin' to eat in de kitchen. dey didn't
give us no way to cook, nor nothin' to cook in our cabins. soon as us
dressed us went by de kitchen an' got our piece of cornbread. dey wasn't
even no salt in dem las' years. dat piece of cornbread was all us had
for breakfus', an' for supper, us had de same.
"for dinner us had boiled vittles; greens, peas an' sometimes beans.
coffee? no'm, us never knowed nothin' 'bout coffee.
"one mornin' i 'members i had started to de fiel', an' on de way i los'
my piece of bread. i didn't know what to do. i started back to try to
fin' it, an' it was too dark to see. but i walk back raght slow, an' had
a dog dat walked wid me. he went on ahead, an' atter awhile i come on
him lyin' dere guardin' dat piece of bread. he never touched it, so i
gived him some of it.
"jus' befo' de war i married a man named chatfield from another
plantation; but he was took off to war an' i never seed him ag'in. atter
awhile i married a boy on de plantation named miles garlic.
"yas'm, massa garlic had two boys in de war. when dey went off de massa
an' missis cried, but it made us glad to see dem cry. dey made us cry so
much.
"when we knowed we was free, everybody wanted to git out. de rule was
dat if you stayed in yo' cabin you could keep it, but if you lef', you
los' it. miles was workin' at wetumpka, an' he slipped in an' out so us
could keep on livin' in de cabin.
"my secon' baby soon come, an' raght den i made up my min' to go to
wetumpka where miles was workin' for de railroad. i went on down dere
an' us settled down.
"atter miles died, i lived dere long as i could an' den come to
montgomery to live wid my son. i'se eatin' white bread now an' havin' de
best time of my life. but when de lawd say, 'delia, well done; come up
higher,' i'll be glad to go."
angie garrett
interview with angie garrett
—ruby pickens tartt, livingston, alabama
she sat in the door of her small cabin, a short distance from
livingston, alabama, in philosophical reflection. time has not softened
her memories. as she told these facts an occasional expression of
bitterness passed over her face.
"i's angie garrett," she said. i was about sixteen years at beginning uv
de wa'. i was born in de kalb, mississippi. my mother was betty scott,
an' i didn't know my father's name. i had four brothers, ember, johnny,
jimmie, and henry; and three sisters, delphie, lizzie sue, and frankie,
and my grandmother was sukie scott. she lived five miles from
gainesville across noxubee creek (in full, oka noxubee) an' i lived wid
her. never axed 'bout my grand-daddy, 'caze wa'n't no tellin'. my mammy
lived right here in gainesville an' belong to mr. sam harwood.
"i b'longed to de moorings and cap'n mooring run on a boat to mobile
from aberdeen, mississippi, 'twus on de 'bigbee river, an' 'twus called
de cremonia. i was de house gal an' nuss an' i slep' on a pallet in
old miss's room. i had plenty to eat long as us was on dat boat, and dat
sho' was good. but when us was in de kalb, vittles was giv' out at de
smoke house, a slice o' meat and piece of bread and peas, and 'twus
sarnt out ter de fiel'. mules be eatin' and niggers be eatin'.
"i nussed de moorings little boy johnny. de little gal had died. mr.
scott in de kalb had 'bout fifty slaves and a big plantation and a
overseer name' barnes. he was a haughty man, and niggers was skeered to
death 'caze he would come in a-cussin'.
"us would git up 'fo' daylight. 'twus dark when go out, dark when come
in. us make a little fire in de fiel' some mawnin's, hit beeze so cold;
dan us let it go out 'fo' de overseer come. ef he seed you he'd make
yer lay down flat on yo' belly, foots tied out and han's tied out and
whoop yer wid slapper leather strap wid a handle. but i was laid 'cross
a cheer. i been whooped 'tel i tell lies on myself to make 'em quit. say
dey whoop 'till i'd tell de troof, so i had ter lie 'bout myse'f keep
'em from killin' me. dis here race is mo' lac de chillun uv isreal,
'cept dey didn't have ter shoot no gun ter set um free.
"i was sole ter mr. johnny mooring, 'caze de property was in debt. and
den fuss i b'longed ter mrs. scott at de kalb, and her sole me, an' i
sho' was glad. i walked here to gainesville frum de kalb, mississippi.
us wa'n't 'lowed to learn nothin'. sometimes us sing and have a little
prayer meetin', but 'twus mighty easy and quiet like. gran'ma sukey use'
to sing, "travel on, travel on, soon be over."
"ef any us died in dem days, buried us quick as dey could and got out of
dere and got to work. at night dey blow'd de horn for 'em to bring in de
cotton w'ut de women spinned. dey made all de clof. us worked nights
too, but us rested sundays. us didn't git no presents at christmas.
sometimes us had a corn shuckin', and no celebration for no marriage.
dat was called "jumpin' de broom," jes' taken up wid 'em. dey all want
you to have plenty of chillun, though.
"us wo' asafetida 'roun' us neck keep off de small pox and measles. us
didn't have much medicine and some of um was always full of bad
complaints lac' carrie, my neighbor, whut you axed about. i bees
a-hurtin', but i can't never git in edgeways for her. always got a lot
excuses; doan' never 'spects to die 'thout folks knows whut ails her.
but she brought me some black-eyed peas today, and i lac's um 'caze dey
biles sof', and i say 'ef de devil brought hit, god sarnt hit.'
sometimes i bees hongry, an' i say, 'whut is i'm gwinter eat?', and

"no'm, i doan' never go ter church no mo'. de preachers here is goin'

'zactly whar hit was in de ole co't house, but i gits all bumfuzzled
tryin' to fin' anybody in dis new buildin'."
his name was henry garry. he wore a suit of faded and extensively
patched confederate gray and a cap of the regulation porter's style. his
face bore the expression worn only by those of his race who had lived
and toiled in a much earlier and in many instances, happier day. in the
presence of "white folks" he was at ease, indicating an intimate
association and relationship among them and in their service.
"what business have you in judge abernathy's court? you don't look like
a criminal," was the response.
"oh, nawsah, i ain't neber done nothin' to nobody no time. but i sho'
don't know what dis new generation of nigguhs comin' to. hit war bad
'nough when dey couldn' git nothin' but bootleg cawn licker; now dey kin

somebody wid a razor or a meat axe or somp'n an' 'long come de law,

"but why should all that disturb you? they haven't run you in have

quizzed further.
"lawd man, i was bawn in de back yahd whar marse john rogers live right

conduc's de meetin's.
"i don't know 'bout yuther parts, but from what my mammy tell me de
slaves in sumter county mus' hab had a mighty good time, had plenty of
ebery t'ing an' nothin' to worry 'bout. seems lak dar warn't no trouble
'mongst de whites an' blacks 'twell atter de wah. some white mens come
down from de norf' an' mess up wid de niggers. i was a mighty little
shaver, but i 'members one night atter supper, my daddy and mammy an' us

"cap'n, dem mens look lak dey ten feet high an' dey hosses big as

"my daddy went ober to whar he settin' on his hoss at de well. den he

didn' stop twell he drunk three buckets full. den he jes' wipe his mouf
an' say, 'lawdy, dat sho' was good. hit was de fust drink of water i'se

"was we good? cap'n, from den on dar wasn't a nigger dare stick his head

fenologists in de country, an' dey say hit's three quarters carbolic
acid gas, an' de yuther seben eights is hydrophobia.'
"yassah, dat ole cannon in de co'te house yahd at livingston was drug
outten de tombigbee ribber whar de yankees done sunk it time of de wah.
de men's useter load 'er up an' shoot 'er off on big days at livingston.
dey had to spike de ole gun, 'dough, to keep de deblish boys 'roun' town
from shootin' it off jes' fo' fun.
"git rid of de carpetbaggers? oh yassah, dey vote 'em out. well, sah,
tell you how dey done dat. de 'publicans done paid all de niggers' poll
tax, an' gib 'em a receipt so dey could vote same as de whites. dey made
up to 'lect de officers at de co't house all niggers an' den sen'
yuther ones to montgomery to make de laws. same day de 'lection come off

de circus to let all sumter county niggers in de show by showin' dere
poll tax receipts. yessah, when de show was ober de 'lection was ober
too, an' nobody was 'lected 'cepin' white demmycrats.
"'cose dat made sumter county a mighty onhealthy place for carpetbaggers
an' uppity niggers.
henry garry, birmingham, alabama
"yo' ax me 'bout de old songs de slaves useter sing. well, i don't
'members many of dem. atter de s'render all de ole slaves what stayed on
de plantations 'roun' gainesville useter gather at de landin' dar
waitin' to see de steamboats pull in from down de tombigbee on dere way
to columbus, (miss.), an' somebody'd start a song, an', law' man, how
dem niggers sing. here one i heerd my mammy sing so much i learnt it:
"read in de bible, understan'
methuselah was de oldes' man.
he lived nine hundred an' sixty nine
den died an' go to heben in de lawd's due time.
methuselah was a witness
for my lawd,
for my lawd.
"read in de bible, understan'
samson was de stronges' man.

killed a thousan' of de philistines.
samson was a witness
for my lawd,
for my lawd.
"daniel was a hebrew chile,
went to de lawd to pray a while.
de lawd tole de angels de lions to keep,
so daniel lay down an' went to sleep.
an' dat's anoder witness
for my lawd,
for my lawd.
"now 'bout de ghos' tales. i neber heerd many ghos' yarns 'cep' 'bout de
chinyberry tree whar dey hung mistah steve renfroe. he was 'lected high
sheriff dat time dey got all de niggers to go to de circus 'stead of
goin' to de 'lection. he a fine lookin' man an' ride a big white hoss
an' ebe'ybody lak him a lot 'cep' de carpetbaggers an' boddersome
niggers. no matter whar, if he meet one of 'em, he look 'em squar' in de
eye for a minute, den 'bout all he say would be, 'get to hell outten
heah!' an' man, iffen dey could fly dat would be too slow trabelin' for
'em, gettin' outten de county. but atter while he got in trouble 'bout
money matters. dey say he got color blind, couldn' tell his money from
de county's. so dey 'rest him an' put him in jail, but he bust right out
an' run off. atter while he sneak back an' 'caze his ku klux frien's
wouldn' help him outten de trouble when he got back in jail, he give 'em
away an' tell what dere name was. one night a gang took him outten de
livingston jail an' go 'bout a mile outten town an' hang him to a
chinyberry tree. i'se hyeard iffen you go to dat tree today an' kinda
tap on hit an say, 'renfroe, renfroe; what did you do?' de tree say
right back at you, 'nothin'.'
"nawsuh, folks down 'roun' gainesville didn' pay much min' to signs an'
conju' an' all dat stuff. my mammy wouldn' let us tote a axe on our
shoulder th'ough de house, an' she wouldn' 'low a umbrella to be opened
in de house, say hit bring bad luck. she neber fail to hab cown-fiel'
peas an hawg-jowl for dinner on new yeah's day. she say hit a sign you
hab plenty to eat balance ob de yeah. she put a ball of asafetida on a
string an' make all us chillun wear it 'roun' our neck to keep off
sickness. if a owl begin to hoot ober in tombigbee bottom too close to
de house, she put de shovel in de fire to make him stop.
"wall, sir, i come to bummin'ham mos' forty yeahs ago when marse josiah

fannie gibson
interview with fannie gibson
—j.r. jones, columbus, georgia
fannie gibson was born the slave property of mr. benajer goff, a planter
of near roanoke, alabama. she says that during her girlhood she "piddled
in de fiels an hepped in de kitchen o' de big house."
she has very pleasant memories of slave days, and "wishes to god dat she
was as comforbly (comfortably) fixed now as she was den."
her ante-bellum owner she pictures as a very humane, christian
gentleman—a man that took great interest in the material and spiritual
welfare of his slaves.
two hymns, sung by 'aunt' fannie for her interviewer, are appended.
going home to live with the lord.
goin' home soon in de mornin',
goin' home soon in de mornin',
i's goin' home to live with de lord.
in de mornin' so soon,
in de mornin' so soon,
i's goin' home to live with de lord.
i's goin' home to live with de lord,
i's goin' home to live with de lord,
i's goin' home soon in de mornin'.
o, de lord is a-waitin' for me,
o, de lord is a-waitin' for me,

where were you when you found the lord?
my brother, where were you,
my brother, where were you,

when you found the lord?
i was low down in the valley,

my sister, where were you,
when you found the lord?
i was low down in the valley,
i was low down in the valley,

this song can be extended indefinitely by addressing the question to
various members of one's family, and to friends.
frank gill
personal interview with frank gill
 south hamilton street, mobile, alabama
—ila b. prine, mobile, alabama
a low, stout, sleek headed negro man, sat in an old rocking chair in an
end room of a long row of rooms of a tenement house at  south
hamilton street, mobile, alabama. this old darkey said, when asked by
the writer if he lived during slavery times: "i not only lived durin'
slavery times, but i was here before a gun was fired, an' b'fore lincoln
was elected. i tells you, miss, de fust time i 'members anything—a tale
of any kind. i was livin' in vicksburg, lee county, mississippi, an' mah
maw an' paw's names was amelia williams an' hiram gill. i couldn't tells
you whar dey war from, dough. but i does know dat mista arthur an'
george foster owned us, up 'til i war a big boy. de way it was, dere
mother, ol' missy, was a widow, an' her had dese two boys, an' she had
money, i tells you she had barrels ob money; so when de two boys got old
enough she divide de slaves, an' property 'tween 'em. me an' mah maw
fell to arthur foster, and sum ob our kindred fell to george foster.
mister george was a captain in de army an' was killed near vicksburg.
"de ol' missy's place shore was big, i couldn't say how many acres dere
was, but hit run four or five miles, an' she owned hundreds ob slaves.
she had lots ob log cabin quarters, whut had de cracks daubed wid mud,
an' den ceiled wid boards. i'se tellin' you dey was twice as warm as de
houses we lib in now. dey had chimbleys built ob mud an' sticks, an' had
big wide, fireplaces, dat we cooked on, an' de beds was homemade, but
lor' dey was heaps stronger dan dey is now, in dese times. dem beds was
morticed together.
"as i said b'fore i was a boy between fourteen or fifteen years old
b'fore de slaves was divided, an' when i was on de ol' missy's place, i
stayed aroun' de house, an' wait on dem, an' 'tend de horses. anudder
thing i had to do, dey would send me for the mail. i had to go twelve
miles atter hit an' i couldn't read or write, but i could bring
everybody's mail to dem jes' right. i knowed i had better git hit right.
you see i could kinder figure, so i could make out by de numbers.
"ol' missy an' mister arthur both was good to me an' all de slaves, dey
'low de slaves to make dere own patch ob cotton, an' raise chickens, an'
he would sell hit for dem. cotton was de main crop, in dem days, hit
would sell as high as twenty-five cents a pound. 'course dey raises
corn, pears, an' other things on de plantation, too, but dey made de
cotton. master jesus! dey sumtimes made from fifty to one hundred an'
fifty bales.
"i 'members how all de women had looms, both black and white, weavin'
cloth for de clothes; an' den dey raised sheep to git de wool to make
dem gray uniforms. lord, at sheep shearing time! hit was big times. let
me tell you, miss, dem uniforms was made out ob all wool, too, but i
cain't 'member whut dey used to dye 'em gray, but i 'members dey dyed
wid red oak bark, walnut bark, an' also a brush whut growed down on the
branch, also dey used de laurel leaves to dye yellow, as well as clay.
dey so't de dye wid salt, an' hit really stayed in.
"let me tell you, dey really fed us slaves good, up 'til such a length
o' time atter de war broke out, den food began to git scarce.
"you see de government taxed 'em, an' dey had to gib so much to feed de
soldiers. even den us had a good time, i 'members how de li'l chillun
played ball, and marbles, 'specially marbles, hit was our big game. even
atter night dey had a big light out in de backyard, an' us would play.
sometimes us would hunt at night, and well i 'members one sat'day night
i went huntin' wid mah uncle, an' didn't git in 'til daylight nex'
mawning, an' i was sleepy an' didn't git de shoes all cleaned before
church time. so ol' marsar called me an' tuk me to de carriage house to
gib me a whippin'. ol' marser's boy was about de same age as me an' he
beg his paw not to whip me, an' i was beggin', too, but he carried me
on, an' when we got in de carriage house, ol' marser had to climb up on
de side wall to git de whip, an' he had on one ob dos long tailed coats,
an' hit left dem tails hangin' down, so i jes' grabbed hold ob dem, an'
made him fall, an' den i run to de ol' missy's room, 'ca'se i knowed
when i got in dere, dat ol' marser would neber hit me.
"de ol' missy got up out ob de bed an' wouldn't let ol' marster whip me,
an' she got so mad dat she tol' him dat she warn't going to church wid
him dat morning, an' dat lack to kill de ol' marster, 'ca'se he shore
loved an' was proud ob ol' missy. she was a beautiful woman. dat ended
de whippin', an' dat's de only time i 'members him tryin' to whip me.
"ol' missy didn't 'low dem to whip de women either, an' dey wouldn't
'low de women to roll logs either. but dey did work dem in de fiel's.
'course dey kept de young women wid babies 'roun' de house, an' dey eat
de same grub as de white folks eat.
"talking 'bout log rollin', dem was great times, 'ca'se if some ob de
neighborin' plantations wanted to get up a house, dey would invite all
de slaves, men and women, to come wid dere masters. de women would help
wid de cookin' an' you may be shore dey had something to cook. dey
would kill a cow, or three or four hogs, and den hab peas, cabbage, an'
everything lack grows on de farm. an' if dere was any meat or food lef'
dey would gib dat to de slaves to take home, an' jes' b'fore dark de
o'seer or ol' marster would gib de slaves all de whiskey dey wanted to
drink. sometimes atter de days work, dey would hab a frolic, such as
dancin', an' ol' time games.
"dey would hab dese same kind ob gatherin's at cornshucking time, an'
cotton pickin' time, but dere warn't so much foolishness at cotton
pickin' time, 'ca'se dey didn't call one anudder den, 'ceptin' when de
cotton got so far ahead ob dem, an' was 'bout to set in fer a wet spell,
or rainy season.
"you axed me 'bout de patty-rollers? you see de city policemen walkin'
his beat? well, dat's de way de patty-rollin' was, only each county had
dere patty-rollers, an' dey had to serve three months at a time, den dey
was turned loose. and if dey cotch you out widout a pass, dey would gib
you thirty-nine lashes, 'ca'se dat was de law. de patty-rollers knowed
nearly all de slaves, an' it wurn't very often dey ever beat 'em.
"you know folks was jes' de same den as dey is now, both black, and
white. some folks you could neighbor wid den, jes' lack you can now, an'
dere was good folks den, jes' de same as dey is now.
"christmas time was de bes' ob all, 'ca'se us allus had a big dinner,
an' de ol' marster gib de women calico dresses an' shoes, an' de men
shoes an' hats, an' would gib us flour, an' sugar, molasses, an' would
buy beer, whiskey an' wine.
"de ol' marster tuk good keer ob us too, when any ob us got sick he send
for de doctor, den when dey order de medicine to be giben at night,
he'd see dat us got hit. but nowadays if you git sick, you hab to git de
doctor, an' den pay him yo' se'f. den de ol' marster had to find clothes
an' shoes for us, but now us has to scuffle an' git dem de bes' way us
can.
"you know, miss, i'se been here a long time, i eben 'members jefferson
davis. i'se seen him many a time. he had a home 'tween here (mobile) an'
new orleans, an' you knows he fust tuk his seat in montgomery, an' den
moved to richmond, virginny.
"i 'members, too, how i useta to think dat de baptist was de only
religion. you see john de baptist come here baptizing, an' ever'body had
to offer up sacrifices, a goat or a sheep or sumpin', jes' lack de man
who was going to offer up his son for a sacrifice. but you knows, jesus
come an' changed all dat. de folks in dem times didn't hab nobody to
worship; an' den one come, who said, 'father, hand me a body, and i'll
die for dem,' dat's christ, an' he was baptized, an' god gib jesus dis
whole world. so i believed, dat was de only religion.
"i 'members how us would hab big baptizings an' shout. us allus went to
church in de white folks church, dey had church in de mornings, us had
ours in de afternoons. us would hab to hab a pass, dough, 'ca'se de
church was eight miles away from de plantation.
"dere was plenty old songs us useta to sing, but i can't 'member 'em.
dere is dis one dat goes—
wonderful peter,
wonderful paul,
wonderful silas,
who for to make a
mah heart rejoice.
on good shepherds, feed a' mah sheep.
don't you hear de young lambs a bleatin'?
don't you hear de young lambs a bleatin'?
don't you hear de young lambs a bleatin'?
oh! good shepherds feed a' mah sheep."
jim gillard
interview with jim gillard
—preston klein, opelika, alabama
jim gillard was eleven years old when the war between the states began.
thus, the memories of the conflict are fresh; with the retreat from
rome, ga., to salem, ala., as a refugee, transcending the others.
jim was born on a plantation at pendleton, s.c., and was sold for $
when he was only three months old. he was one of eight children
belonging to james and hannah gillard.
"atter bein' sold, i fust lived 'bout three miles from rome, ga.," jim
recalled. "den, when de yankees come into georgy us refugeed fust to
atlanta, den to columbus an' later to salem. us was at salem when de war
ended."
jim remembers catching partridges as a boy, taking them to the train and
selling them to charlie crowder for ten cents each.
"game was plentiful in dem days," he said, "an' i never had any trouble
catchin' dem birds.
"no'm, our houses wasn't nothin' to brag about. dey was built of hewn
logs an' had slab floors, havin' two rooms an' a shed cook room. us beds
was lak tables, wid four legs nailed on to de sides an' den corded over
de top wid ropes dat was tightened wid a big key. us had shuck
mattresses to sleep on.
"us cooked on a great big fireplace. i 'members dat dere was plenty of
meat in de winter, 'ca'se ol' marster used to kill as many as thirty
hogs at a time. us had meat an' bread an' home-made light bread an' de
white folks was mighty kind. i 'members us was carried to sunday school
every sunday at  o'clock in de evenin'. ol' mistus'd teach us de
lesson. de white chilluns had dere sunday school at  o'clock in de
mornin.'
"i allus went to sunday school, but on de week days us little niggers
would slip off an' go huntin' when we could."
jim recalls that "de little niggers" ate from tin plates on the
plantation; but declared he didn't mind that because the food was always
good.
"yes'm, us had purty good clothes. dey was dyed brown wid walnut leaves
an' hazelnut bush, an' on sunday us had striped gingham pants an' shoes.
my father was de shoemaker an' had a gov'mint tan yard whar he would
make ol' hard brogans fer $ a pair.
"my marster an' mistus was steven an' 'lizbeth wilson. dey fust lived in
a big log house, but den moved into a planked house. dey had nine
chillun; ann, steven, william, liza, humie, eddie, laura, mary an'
lizzie.
"i 'members lots 'bout mistus 'lizabeth, 'ca'se she useter read de bible
to us niggers. she would talk to us 'bout de good book an' have prayer
meetin' wid us.
"my dad useter look atter de fiel' hands. no'm, he war'nt no overseer,
but ol' marster allus had confidence in him.
"i 'members dat when dey would be a funeral, us'd sing; marchin' befo'
de body 'fore us'd get to de grave an' singin', 'hark come de tune a
doleful sound, my years a tender cry; a livin' man come view de ground
whar you may shortly lie.'
"us frolics on sattidy night was fine an' us'd dance 'twel mos' day.
marster's brother would fiddle for us, an' at christmas time us would
have six days to frolic. us also had a big time at de cornshuckin's, an'
us'd whoop an' holler an' sing mos' all night. de big niggers had plenty
of liquor de boss give 'um. high tables was filled up wid corn an' de
niggers would shuck 'twel it was all done.
"my aunt married up at de big house an' dey give her a big dance. dey
had de fiddle and had a great big time. dey jes' jumped over de broom
to marry, so atter slavery dey had to git married agin.
"i acted as houseboy in slavery times. an' all de little niggers did
have lots of fun.
"when de slaves got ailin', i 'members dat marster had dr. word an' dr.
dunwoody to come to see us.
"i 'members, too, how de yankees come to spring villa, 'bout eight miles
from opelika, an' said to some mens, 'halt'. de mens wouldn't stop so de
yankees throwed dey guns on dem. two white ladies threw a white flag an'
dey wouldn't shoot, but dey carried mr. john edwards to spring villa an'
made a cross on his wrist; den turned him loose 'ca'se his wife was rale
sick.
"when de yankees come, us niggers buried a cigar box wid de jewelry in
it under a certain pine tree 'twel dey went on.
"atter de big war, i married jane davis fust time; den carrie cooper. us
had two chillun an' one gran' chile, emanuel trotter, ten year' old.
"yassu'm, mr. abraham lincoln died a warrior for dis country. i b'longs
to de church, 'ca'se if a man dies outter de ark he is not saved, an' i
wants to be saved."
mary ella grandberry
interview with mary ella grandberry
—levi d. shelby, jr., tuscumbia, alabama
life as a child is not clear in the ninety-year old memory of mary ella
grandberry, who lives in sheffield, but she remembers that she did not
have time to play as do children of today.
"i don't know jes' how old i is," mary ella said, "but i knows dat i'm
some'ers nigh ninety yars ol'. i was borned in barton, alabama. my
father an' mother come from richmond, virginny. my mammy was name
margaret keller an' my pappy was adam keller. my five sisters was
martha, sarah, harriet, emma an' rosanna, an' my three brothers was
peter, adam, jr., an' william.
"us all live in a li'l two-room log cabin jes' off the big house. life
wan't ver' much for us, 'caze we had to work an' slave all de time.
massa jim's house was a little ol' frame buildin' lack a ord'nary house
is now. he was a single man an' didn't hab so terr'ble much, it seem. he
had a whole lot, too, but jes' to look at him you'd thank he was a po'
white man. dere was a lot o' cabins for de slaves, but dey wasn't fitten
for nobody to lib in. we jes' had to put up wid 'em.
"i don' 'member much about when i was a chil'. i disremembers ever
playin' lack chilluns do today. ever since i kin 'member i had a water
bucket on my arm totin' water to de han's. iffen i wan't doin' dat, i
was choppin' cotton. chilluns nowadays sees a good time to w'at we did
den. ever' mornin' jes' 'bout hip of day de oberseer was 'roun' to see
dat we was ready to git to de fiel's. plenty times us had to go widouten
breakfas', 'caze we didn' git up in time to git it 'fo' de man done come
to git us on de way to de fiel'. us wukked 'twell dinner time jes' de
same before we got anythang to eat.
"de food we et was fix jes' lack hit is now. my mammy fixed our grub at
home. de on'y diffe'nce 'tween den an' now was us didn' git nothin' but
common things den. us didn' know what hit was to git biscuits for
breakfas' ever' mornin'. it was cornbread 'twell on sundays den us'd git
fo' biscuits apiece. us got fatback mos' ever' mornin'. sometimes us
mought git a chicken for dinner on a sunday or some day lack chris'mas.
it was mighty seldom us gits anythin' lack dat, dough. we lacked possums
an' rabbits but dey didn' come twell winter time when some of de men
folks'd run 'crost one in de fiel'. dey never had no chanst to git out
an' hunt none.
"dere was no sech thang as havin' diffe'nt clo's for winter an' summer.
us wore de same thang in summertime as in de wintertime. de same was
true 'bout shoes. us wore brogans from one yeah to de yuther.
"my ol' massa was a putty good man but nothin' exter. one thang 'bout
him, he wouldn' 'low none of de oberseers to whup none of us, lessen he
was dar to see hit done. good thang he was lack dat, too, 'caze he sabed
de blacks a many a lick what dey'd got iffen he hadn' been dar. massa
jim was a bach'lor, an' he ain't never had much truck wid women folks.
iffen he had any chilluns, i never knowed nothin' 'bout 'em.
"de oberseers was terrible hard on us. dey'd ride up an' down
de fiel' an' haste you so twell you near 'bout fell out. sometimes
an' most inginer'ly ever' time you 'hin' de crowd you got a good
lickin' wid de bull whup dat de driver had in de saddle wid him.
i hearn mammy say dat one day dey whupped po' leah twell she fall
out like she was daid. den dey rubbed salt an' pepper on de blisters
to make 'em burn real good. she was so so' 'twell she couldn' lay
on her back nights, an' she jes' couldn' stan' for no clo's to tech
back whatsomever.
"massa jim had 'bout one of de bigges' plantations in dat section. i
guess he had nigh onto a hun'erd blacks on de place. i never knowed
'zackly how many thar was nor how big de place was.
"de folks now'days is allus complainin' 'bout how dey is havin' sech
hard times, but dey jes' don' know nothin'. dey should hab come up when
i did an' dey'd see now dey is libin' jes' lack kings an' queens. dey
don' have to git up 'fo' day when hit's so dark you kin jes' see your
han's 'fo' your eyes. dey don' know what it's lack to have to keep up
wid de leader. you know dey was allus somebody what could wuk faster dan
de res' of de folks an' dis fellow was allus de leader, an' ever'body
else was s'pose to keep up wid him or her whatsomever hit was. iffen you
didn' keep up wid de leader you got a good thrashin' when you gits home
at night. hit was allus good dark when de han's got in from de fiel'.
co'se iffen dar was a lady what had a baby at home, she could leave jes'
a little 'fo' de sun sot.
"younguns now'days don' know what it is to be punish'; dey thank iffen
dey gits a li'l whuppin' from dey mammy now dat dey is punish' terrible.
dey should of had to follow de leader for one day an' see how dey'd be
punish' iffen dey gits too far behin'. de bigges' thang dat us was
punish' for was not keepin' up. dey'd whup us iffen we was caught
talkin' 'bout de free states, too. iffen you wan't whupped, you was put
in de 'nigger box' an' fed cornbread what was made widouten salt an' wid
plain water. de box was jes' big 'nough for you to stan' up in, but hit
had air holes in hit to keep you from suffocatin'. dere was plenty
turnin' 'roun' room in hit to 'low you to change your position ever'
oncet in a while. iffen you had done a bigger 'nough thang you was kep'
in de 'nigger box' for months at de time, an' when you got out you was
nothin' but skin an' bones an' scurcely able to walk.
"half de time a slave didn' know dat he was sol' 'twell de massa'd call
him to de big house an' tell him he had a new massa from den on. ever'
time dat one was sol' de res' of 'em'd say, 'i hopes nex' time'll be
me.' dey thought you'd git a chanst to run away to de free states. i
hearn my mammy say dat when she come from virginny dat she come on a
boat built outten logs. she say she never was so sick in all her life. i
seed a 'hole wagon load of slaves come through our farm one day what was
on dere way to arkansas. dey was de mos' i ever seed travel at de same
time.
"de white folks didn't 'low us to even look at a book. dey would scol'
an' sometimes whup us iffen dey caught us wid our head in a book. dat is
one thang i sho'ly did want to do an' dat was to learn to read an'
write. massa jim promised to teach us to read an' write, but he neber
had de time.
"dere wan't but one chu'ch on de place what i lived on, an' de colored
and de white both went to hit. you know we was neber 'lowed to go to
chu'ch widoutten some of de white folks wid us. we wan't even 'lowed to
talk wid nobody from anudder farm. iffen you did, you got one of de wus'
whuppin's of your life. atter freedom massa jim tol' us dat dey was
'fraid we'd git together an' try to run away to de no'th, an' dat was
w'y dey didn' wan' us gittin' together talkin'.
"a few years 'fo' de war my pappy learnt to read de bible. (mary ella
apparently forgot her previous comment on penalties for learning to
read). whenever we would go to chu'ch he would read to us an' we'd sing.
'bout de mos' two pop'lar songs dey sung was 'steal away' an' 'i wonder
whar good ol' dan'el was.' 'steal away' is sech a pop'lar song what
ever'body knows hit. de yuther one is done mought' nigh played out, so
i'll sing hit for you. it goes lack dis:
i wonder whar was good ol' dan'el,
i wonder whar was good ol' dan'el,
i wonder whar was thankin' (thinking) peter,
i wonder whar was thankin' peter.
(chorus)
i'm goin' away, goin' away.
i'm goin' away, goin' away.
i wonder whar was weepin' mary,
i wonder whar was weepin' mary,
i'm goin' away, i'm goin' away,
i'm goin' away to live forever,
i'll never turn back no mo'.
"de slaves would git tired of de way dey was treated an' try to run away
to de no'th. i had a cousin to run away one time. him an' anudder fellow
had got 'way up in virginny 'fo' massa jim foun' out whar dey was. soon
as massa jim foun' de whar'bouts of george he went atter him. when massa
jim gits to george an' 'em, george pertended lack he didn' know massa
jim. massa jim as' him, "george don't you know me?' george he say, 'i
neber seed you 'fo' in my life.' den dey as' george an' 'em whar did dey
come from. george an' dis yuther fellow look up in de sky an' say, 'i
come from above, whar all is love.' iffen dey had owned dey knowed massa
jim he could have brung 'em back home. my pappy tried to git away de
same time as george an' dem did, but he couldn' see how to take all us
chillun wid him, so he had to stay wid us. de blacks an' de whites would
have de terr'bles' battles sometimes. dat would be when de blacks would
slip off to de no'th an' was caught an' brung back. de paterollers'd
ketch de colored folks an' lock 'em up twell de owner came atter 'em.
"iffen a slave was cotched out after nine o'clock he was whupped. dey
didn' 'low nobody out atter it was dark 'lessen he had a pass from de
massa. one night, 'fo' george an' dis fellow (i disremembers his name,
but i thinks it was ezra) runned away, george tried to git over to de
bunk whar he lived an' one of de oberseers seen him an' dey put him in
de 'nigger box' for three weeks. jes' as soon as he got out again,
george an' dis ezra slipped off. dey had a sign dat dey would give each
yuther eve'y night atter sundown. george would hang de lantern in de
window, an' den he would take it outen de window an' hang it raght back
in dar ag'in. i couldn't never make no sense outen it. i axed him one
day whut he was adoin' dat for. he say dat 'fo' long i'd know 'zackly
what is all about. dis was de sign of how long dey have to wait 'fo' dey
try to git away.
"atter de day's work was over, de slaves didn't have nothin' to do but
go to bed. in fac', dey didn't feel lack doin' nothin' else. on satiday
dey sot up an' washed so's dey could have some clean clothes to wear de
comin' week. we wukked all day, ever' day 'cep'n some sat'days, we had a
half day off den. us didn' git many an' on'y when us as' for 'em. on
sundays us jes' laid 'roun' 'mos' all day. us didn't git no pleasure
outten goin' to church, 'caze we warn't 'lowed to say nothin'. sometimes
even on chris'mas us didn't git no res'. i 'members on one chris'mas us
had to build a lime kiln. when us git a holiday us rested. iffen dere
was a weddin' or a funeral on our plantation us went. odderways we don't
go nowhar.
"de war come when i was a big gal. i 'member dat my uncle an' cousin
jined in wid de yankees to hope fight for de freedom. de yankees come to
our place an' runned massa jim away an' tuk de house for a horsepittil.
dey tuk all of massa jim's clothes an' gived dem to some of dere
frien's. dey burned up all de cotton, hay, peas an' ever'thing dat was
in de barns. dey made de white folks cook for de colored an' den serve
'em while dey et. de yankees made 'em do for us lak we done for dem. dey
showed de white folks what it was to work for somebody else. dey stayed
on our place for de longes'. when dey did leave, dere warn't a mouthful
to eat in de house. when de war was over, massa jim told us dat we had
to find som'ers else to live. co'se some of my folks had already gone
when he come home. us lef' massa jim's an' moved to anudder farm. we got
pay for de wuk what we did on dis yuther place. raght atter de war de ku
klux got atter de colored folks. dey would come to our houses an' scare
us mos' to death. dey would take some of de niggers out an' whup 'em an'
dose dat dey didn't whup dey tied up by dere fingers an' toes. dese ku
klux would come to our windows at night an' say: 'your time ain't long
acomin'.' de ku klux got so bad dat dey would even git us in de daytime.
dey tuk some of de niggers an' throwed 'em in de river to drown. dey
kep' dis up 'twell some folks from de north come down an' put a stop to
it.
"i ma'ied nelson granberry. de weddin' was private. i don't have no
chilluns, but my husban' got fo'. i haven't heered from any of 'em in a
long time now. i guess dey all daid.
"abe lincoln was de bes' president dat dis country eber had. iffen it
hadn't been for him we'd still be slaves raght now. i don't think so
much of jeff davis 'caze he tried to keep us slaves. booker t.
washington was one of de greates' niggers dat ever lived, he always
tried to raise de standard of de race.
"i joined the church 'caze de bible says dat all people should join de
church an' be christians. jesus christ set up de church an' said dat
ever'body what wanted to be saved to come unto him. sin is de cause of
de world bein' in de fix dat it's in today. de only way to fight sin is
to git together. iffen we can do away wid sin raght now, de world would
be a paradise. in de church we learn de will of god an' what he would
have us do.
"dere was no po' white trash in our 'munity; dey was kep' back in de
mountains."
esther green
interview with esther green
—ila b. prine
'aunt' esther green, of  texas street, mobile, alabama, was all too
ready to talk about her slavery days in spite of her assertion that she
didn't remember much about the war.
"i was jus' a chile," she says. "you can figure for yourself. somebody
tole me i was born in , so i couldn't of been very old. i was born
in state line, mississippi, and was owned by edward davis. he owned my
mother, rachel davis and her mother, melinda davis. i never did know who
my pappy was 'cause i never did see him.
"to de bes' of my recollections, my whitefolks was allus good to us
niggers. he neber allowed no overseers and he never whipped none of dem,
'ceptin' maybe a switching once in a while for us littl'luns when we
didn't behave. i never saw a growed up nigger whipped in all my life.
ole massa jus' didn't b'lieve in dat. massa was shorely a good man. lots
of times he would get us little niggers up on de porch at de big house
and have us dance for him. we sho used to have a big time out on dem big
white porches.
"i never had no work to do myself, 'cause i always stayed in de big
house wid miss mary davis, ole massa's wife. i was in de house one day
and ole massa asked me if i wanted to eat at de table wid dem, so i
pulled up a chair and spite of de fact dere was all kinds of good stuff
to eat in front of me, i called for lye hominy. i sho did love dat stuff
better'n anything else i ever et. ole massa and de res' of dem jus'
laugh fit to kill. i reckon dey thought i was crazy sho' nuff', but i et
hominy jes' de same.
"as to de number of slaves ole massa had, i never knew. us had log
cabins to stay in. de cracks was chinked up wid yellow mud to keep de
cold out and de chim'ney was made of straw and de same kind of mud, but
dem cabins was warmer dan de house is nowadays. we didn't have no
furniture 'ceptin' a home-made bed which was nailed to de wall on one
side and two legs out in de middle of de floor. de mattresses was made
of straw and hay. all de cookin' was done on de big open fireplaces what
had big potracks to hang de pots on.
"massa rationed out de food every week and we usually got a peck of
meal. we had plenty of 'taters and peas and other vegetables dat we
growed on de place. at chris'mas time, we was give meat and molasses to
make cakes. us always had plenty of plain food. and too, de men would go
huntin' at night and come back wid lots of big fat 'possums and rabbits
by de dozen, and mos' of de time, dey would even catch a coon. and old
ben, a nigger who had turkey traps, was always bringin' in lots of dem
big fat birds.
"de men and women worked in de field all day, but i never picked a bit
of cotton all my life. at night de women would spin and weave cloth, but
i never did learn to do dat. den dey would dye de cloth different
colors, mostly red and blue though, and make dem into clothes. us
chilluns had a one-piece dress or slip. our shoes was all homemade too.
massa had one man who tanned de leather. he would take it an put it into
a long trough for a long time and den whatever was done dat was supposed
to be done to it, he would take it out and cut it and make shoes. us
chilluns' had shoes same as de grown folks.
"on sundays, we would got to de white folks' church. dere was a shed
built onto de church and we would sit on benches out under de shed and
listen to de preacher. de white folks would have lots of big baptizings,
but i never did see no niggers baptized den.
"ole massa had a big fambly, three boys and six girls. my own ma had
eight chilluns. us was always healthy and never had to have much
medicine. 'bout de only thing i remembers ever takin' was tea made from
de root of de china berry tree. it made good tea for worms, but was to
be used only at certain times of de moon. my man also used jerusalem oak
seed for worms. i never fools wid tryin' to doctor nobody's chilluns
now-a-days, things is all so different.
"my grandma, melinda, and ole ben and his wife was three ole people
massa freed long time before de war. when all de niggers was freed,
massa called em up to de house and tole dem dat dey was loose to go
wherever suited dem, but mos' of dem stayed on de place two or three
weeks, and den one mornin' i woke up and all of dem had left durin' de
night. i was de only nigger left on de place and i jus' cried and cried,
mostly because i was jus' lonesome for some of my own kind to laugh and
talk wid.
"i don't remember exactly what i did after de surrender, but it was
about four years afterwards dat i come to mobile and i been here every
since.
i's a member of de mobile delaware baptist church, but i can't attend
very regular 'count of bein' all crippled up wid de rheumatisms. i
reckon dat ailing is natural though, cause i been here a long time and
i's got forty grandchilluns and more dan dat many
great-grandchilluns."
jake green
interview with jake green
—ruby pickens tartt, livingston, alabama
"yessum, dem niggers sho' was scared when ole buck showed up in de
fiel'," jake green, former slave, laughed with a vigor that denied his
eighty-five years as he described "a conju' what didn' wuk." jake has a
vivid memory of those days before the civil war, though he was only a
small boy when it started.
"me an' my mother an' father b'longed to old man lam whitehead jes' a
few miles from coatopa, 'bout ten miles east of livingston, alabama," he
began. "my mother was molly whitehead, my father was dan whitehead. i
don't know nothin' 'bout my gran'mammy an' gran'pappy, but i had a heap
of unkies.
"mr. whitehead owned dirtin ferry down to belmont, an' dey had a darkey
dere named dick what claim sick all de time. so de massa man said,
'dick, dam it, go to de house. i can't get no work outten you.' so dick
went on. he was a fiddler so dey jes' tuck his vittuls to him for seven
years. den one day, old massa say to de overseer man, 'let's slip up
dere an' see what dick doin'. so dey did, an' dere sot dick, fat as he
could be a-playin' de fiddle an' a-singin',
'fool my massa seben years.
gwiner fool him seben mo'.
hey diddle, de diddle, de diddle, de do'.'
"'bout dat time ole massa poked his head in de do' said 'dam iffen you
will. come outten dere, you black rascal, an' go to work, 'an' i ain't
never hyard of dick complainin' no mo'.
"but dey wan't so mean. sometimes us got whupped but massa had fo' men
he didn't 'low nobody to hit, white er black. dey was unker arch, he was
de main carriage driver; my father, he was de house servant; unker
julius, de fo'man of de plow han's an' unker ed'erds, de fo'man of de
hoe han's. whenever anybody wanted to hire anybody to work for 'em, de
massa send dem fo' out an' hire 'em by de day to chop cotton or pick.
an' dem fo' niggers could chop much cotton in a day as de mule could
plow. whenever dey'd stop de plow at twelve o'clock, dem niggers was
right dere to lay de hoe handles on de plow, an' dat's choppin'. all
four could pick a bale of cotton a day. whenever anybody say, 'mr.
whitehead, i want a bale of cotton picked today,' he'd send dem fo' men
an' dey could pick five hundred pounds apiece an' leave de sun still
runnin'. dey was pickers in dem days!
"cose dey had to begin, an' all us got up 'fo' day. twan't nothin'
strange to be standin' in de fiel' by your plow waitin' for de sun to
come up. ev'body was early risers in dem days. dey was pretty good to
us, but ole mr. buck brasefiel', what had a plantation 'jinin' us'n, was
so mean to his'n dat twan't nothin' for 'em to run away. one nigger,
rich parker, runned off one time an' whilst he gone he seed a hoodoo
man, so when he got back mr. brasefiel' tuck sick an' stayed sick two or
three weeks. some of de darkies tole him, 'rich been to de hoodoo
doctor.' so mr. brasefiel' got up outten dat bed an' come a-yellin' in
de fiel', 'you thought you had ole buck, but by god he rose agin'. dem
niggers was so skeered, dey squatted in de fiel' jes' lack partridges,
an' some of 'em whispered, 'i wish to god he had a-died.'
jake green, livingston, alabama
"'twan't long atter dat come s'render, but dat nigger done lef' dere,
an' didn't nobody know whar parker was at. some of de niggers done
bought an' paid for dey mule an' me an' pappy was rentin' an' wukkin' on
sneers, when here come parker, jes' hyared 'bout s'render. he say 'why
didn't somebody come tell me 'twas s'render?' den he start a-singin'
slav'y chain, slav'y chain,
thank god a'mighty i'm free at las',
free at las', free at las',
thank god a'mighty i'm free at las'.
"but dat wan't none of old massa's niggers. he had one, do' call him
john, an' hit come a traveler an' stayed all night. ole massa p'inted
out john, an' said, 'he ain't never tole me a lie in his life.' de
traveler bet massa a hund'ed dollars 'ginst fo' bits he'd ketch john in
a lie 'fo' he lef'. next mawnin' at de table de mice was pretty bad, so
de traveler caught one by de tail an' put him inside a kiver-lid dish
what was settin' dere on de table, an' he tole ole massa tell john he
could eat sumpin' out of ev'y dish atter dey got th'oo but dat kiver-lid
one, an' not to take kiver offen hit. an' john said, 'nossuh, i won't.'
but john jes' nachully had to see what was in dat dish, so he raise de
lid, an' out hopped de mouse. den hyar come old massa an' axed john
iffen he done what he tole him not to do, an' john 'nied hit. den de
traveler look in de dish an' de mouse wan't dere, an' he said, 'see
dere, john been lyin' to you all de time, you jes' ain't knowed hit,'
an' i reckon he right 'caze us had to lie."
charity grigsby
interview with charity grigsby
—r.p. tartt, [hw: livingston?]
charity grigsby lives in a tumbledown shanty about nine miles from
livingston on the old epes road. she was sewing on a quilt when i
arrived; humming an old plantation song that ran:
angels in de water, walkin' by de light;
po' sinners stand in darkness an' cannot see de light!
a broad smile flowed across her black face as i entered the cabin. she
placed her needle aside, exclaimed: "law me, honey, i's always proud
when de white folks drap aroun'; an' dat's directly so."
"charity," i said, "i want you to tell me about slavery times."
she lowered her head in thought a moment, said:
"honey, what would i tell?"
"just all you remember, charity."
and this is what she told:
"honey, i was borned charity grigsby, but i married nelson grigory;
ain't much 'stinguish in de names; but 'twas a little. my pappy was
dan'l grigsby an' my mammy was mary moore. see, us belonged to ol'
mister jim moore right up yonder 'bove sumterville near ramsey station.
charity grigsby, livingston, alabama
"you goes up de gainesville an' livingston road an' turns off at de
cross road 'bout nine miles from livingston. den you goes due west. it
ain't far from dere; bout six miles, i reckons. 'twan't no big
plantation; 'bout a dozen of us dere; an' marse jim didn't have no
overseer lak de rest. he had dem boys of his'n what seed to us. dey was
john an' william an' jim. dey was all tol'able good to us; but dey would
whoop us if we wasn't 'bedient; jes' like a mother raisin' a chile.
"i can't say how old i is; it's done got away from me; but i was a
stroppin' gal durin' de war. i knows i's eighty-five an' i 'spects i's
more dan dat. i's de mammy of 'leven chilluns; i knows dat; but ain't
but five of dem a-livin'. as you knows, i lives wid two of dem; mattie
an' evie. dey treats me good. hattie an' ellen an' my boy lives in
bessemer. dat is all my individual chilluns, but i's got a few others. i
can't recollect much to tell; been a good while since de war; but when
you calls it to my 'memberance i can think it up.
"honey, dem nigger dogs; dey sho' did run. sometimes dey kotched a
nigger, but dey didn't never run me. i was in de house weavin' an'
spinnin' lak mistus showed me; an' i didn't never get in no trouble wid
nobody.
"an' den again, marse jim was purty tol'able good to us, but mr. ervin
lavendar was sho' mean to his niggers, an' his plantation warn't far
from our'n. he had a pack of dogs what run de niggers; an' dem was
skeery times, i tell you. us didn't l'arn no schoolin' nor go nowhere
nor have no corn shuckin' nor nothin'; jes' 'quired to stay in de
cabins. i hyared 'bout bre'r rabbit an' hoodoo; but i never takes up no
time wid dat foolishness; never seed no sense in it. us got on all right
'thout dat.
"some of de other niggers 'sides me was all de time in trouble, dough.
mr. fulton, who lived clost to mr. lavendar, had a nigger-driver an'
overseer name sanders, an' i bet he was de meanest one of dem all. you
know, honey, dey planted wheat fields in de fall in dem days an' cut it
in de spring. it would come off in time 'nuff to make corn.
"dere was a flock of birds lak blackbirds; only dey was wheat birds;
an' dey went in droves an' fly way up yonder. us had planks to slap
together to keep de birds out er de wheat, because dey et it up.
"well'm, one day mr. sanders tol' one of de women what was one of de
sucklers on de place, dat if she wouldn't do what he axed her to dey was
a black coffin over her haid. she 'fused him; so when he was loadin' his
gun dere in de wheat fiel', he was holdin' de gun barrel propped under
his chin, jes' so, an de other end settin' on de ground. well sir, it
went off an' he killed hisse'f stid of dat sucklin' woman; an' dat was a
awful time, 'ca'se de niggers got skeered an' run, an' dey sot mr.
lavendar's pack of nigger dogs on 'em. de dogs kotched some an' chewed
'em nigh 'bout to death. it warn' none of us, but it were close.
"us laid low, didn't go out nowhere. us wasn't 'lowed to; couldn't go to
prayer meetin' or nothin'.
charity grigsby's house, livingston, alabama
"you ax what dat song i singin' when you come? dat was all of it, an'
dat's 'nuff fer me, 'ca'se it's true. what dey gwine to be no mo' fer?
jes':
angels in de water, walkin' by de light;
po' sinners stan' in darkness an' cannot se de light.
"i don' want no mo' myse'f; jes' dat; dat's all. how come you wants some
mo'? don't dat much satisfy you? but honey, de sun gettin' low an' my
chilluns will soon be comin' from de swamps. ain't no bread cooked fer
'em. i'll tell you some mo' when i gets my mind on it, 'ca'se it's been
a good while since de war.
"yas'm, us has 'nuff to eat; but if us could get anymore, us would lak
it. you know how 'tis; can make out wid mighty little. us eats greens;
lookin' forward to roas' in years comin' in."
charles hayes
interview with charles hayes
—mary a. poole, mobile
"mistis," said charles hayes from his porch in maysville, near mobile,
alabama, "i was a little bitty nigger when de war broke out, an' i
belonged to massa ben duncan who lived at day's landin' on de alabamy
ribber.
"marse ben's house was de regulation plantation wid slave quarters. most
of de things us used was made raght dere on de plantation, sich as:
beds, buckets, tools, soap, brogans, breeches, an' chairs. our
mattresses was either made outen cornshucks or cotton bolls. us cooked
on an open fireplace, an' eve'y sadday night us would go to de big house
for supplies. marse ben was good to his slaves an' he 'lowed dem to have
a little plot of groun' nex' to de cabins whar dey could raise dere own
little crop.
"my mammy was a fiel' han' an' my pappy was a mechanic an' he use to be
de handy man aroun' de big house, makin' eve'thing f'um churns an'
buckets to wagon wheels. my pappy also useta play de fiddle for de white
folks dances in de big house, an' he played it for de colored frolics
too. he sho could make dat thing sing.
"us useta have all sorts of cures for de sick people, f'rinstance, us
used de jerusalem weed cooked wid molasses into a candy for to give to
de chilluns to git rid of worms. den us'd bile de root an' make a kinda
tea for de stomach worms. you know de kinds dat little puppies an'
little chilluns has dat eats all de food dat goes in to de stomach, an'
makes de chile or dog eat plenty but don't git no benefits f'um all
dey're eatin'. horehound, dat growed wild in clarke county, was used for
colds. mullen tea was used for colds an' swollen j'ints. den dere was de
life everlastin' tea dat was also good for colds and horse mint tea dat
was good for de chills an' fevers. co'se, mistis, us niggers had a
regular fambly doctah dat 'tended to us when we was sho 'nough down
raght sick, but dese remedies i's tellin' you 'bout us used when warn't
nothin' much ailin' us. it was always to de owner's interest, mistis, to
have de niggers in a good, healthy condition.
"does i believe in spirits, you says? sho i does. when christ walked on
de water, de apostles was skeered he was a spirit, but jesus told dem
dat he warn't no spirit, dat he was as 'live as dey was. he tol' 'em dat
spirits couldn't be teched, dat dey jus' melted when you tried to. so,
mistis, jesus musta meant dat dere was sich a thing as spirits.
"atter de war my pappy an' mammy stayed on de duncan plantation en'
worked on share crops. dere was a school on de groun's for us slave
chilluns, an' my gran'mammy, salina duncan, taught de bible, 'ca'se she
was f'um virginny an' had been learnt to read an' write by her mistis up
dere.
"my fus' wife was named alice bush, an' us had ten chilluns; my second
one was named caroline turner an' us didn't have but eight. both my ole
womens is daid now, white folks, an' i stays here wid one of my
daughters. you see, my eyesight is almos' gone due to one day when i was
a workin' in de forge, a hot piece of iron flew up an' landed in my eye.
'twarn't long befo' it started to hurtin' in my udder eye. now both is
'bout to give out."
lizzie hill
interview with lizzie hill
—gertha couric
aunt lizzie hill,  years of age, moved from the spurlock plantation,
four miles out, to the city of eufaula about  years ago. she was of
such vigorous constitution, that until recently, she carried on her
regular occupation of laundress or "wash-'oman," as she calls herself.
too feeble to work regularly, she now is cared for by a niece with whom
she lives.
sitting before the fire in a rocking-chair, smoking a clay pipe—her
neat clothing, snow-white hair and wrinkled, kindly face make a pleasing
picture of contentment. her mind is, apparently, unimpaired, and she
readily responds to her recollections of slavery:
lizzie hill, eufaula, alabama
"sho, missey, i 'members 'bout it! i was most grown when freedom come.
my marster (richard dozier) and my mistis was good to all dey niggers
and dey raised me right. i had two little mistises 'bout as old as me,
and i played wid dem all de time and slep' on a pallet in dey room ev'y
night. dey slep' on de big bed. my clothes was jes' as good and clean as
deyrn, an i et what dey et."
the little girls, she explained, were about six and eight years old when
this association began, and it continued until close of the war, when
all were nearly grown.
"atter freedom come," continued aunt lizzie, "mammy moved to cuthbert
and tuk me erway fum old mistis; but i runned away and went back to
mistis, and walked all de fourteen miles down de big road at night—i
runned most ob de way. three times i done dat, but mammy come and tuk me
back to work in de field ev'y time. i wanted to stay wid old mistis. dey
called her 'miss everline' and ev'ybody liked her. bofe my little
mistises got mai'ed and den old marster and old mistis moved off to
texas, and i ain't eber seed none ob 'em no more. i's had a hard time
workin' in de field since de war. fo' freedom come, i nebber worked
cep'n in de house—i was a 'house-girl' and didn't do no field
work."
gabe hines
interview with gabe hines
—gertha couric
old gabe had been long in this world—close to one hundred years. he had
experienced much but one incident had out-lasted all the others—even
the stroke that made him older and more feeble. that experience had
caused gabe and his "ole woman" to stray far from the fold and to walk
all the way back to its shelter.
that was back in reconstruction days, when he was not "bandy in his
knees" and long before anna left him alone in his cabin with just
memories of earlier and happier days.
gabe was "birthed in cusseta, georgia," the son of two faithful old
slaves, hetty and gabe hines, and they "all 'longed to marsa william
shipp an' miss ma'y. he told his story thus:
"endurin' of de wah, i was big enough to be water toter on de
plantation. no, li'l missy, i doan' 'zactly know how old i is 'ceptin'
by de squeakin' an' achin' of my bones. i 'members lots 'bout doze days.
dem was happy times, li'l missy. arter we all was freed, i went to
silver run to live and dar i mahied anna. she lef' me nine yeahs ago an'
that broke the happiness. i miss her ev'whar, jes' keep a-missin' her
though nine yeahs hev gone since dey tuk her from de cabin an' lef' her
up thar on de hill. dere's nights when de mis'ry in dese ol' bones jist
gits past standin' an' on sich nights she come ter me and holp me wid de
linnymint jes' as she useter do. but she caint stay long when she come.
"i was a-tellin' 'bout silver run. arter we was mahied and was gittin'
use to bein' free niggahs, an' happy in our cabin, one night a gen'ulman
from de no'th was to see us an' he tol' us if we'd go wid him he'd pay
us big wages an' gin us a fine house to boot.
"fer two nights we sot dere by dat chimbly a-thinkin' a sight to do or
to don't and ponderin' this way and t'other one. den we 'cided to go. we
lef ev'y thing dar 'ceptin' whut we tied up in a bandana han'chief, and
we tied that onto a stick for de gen'ulman from de no'th wouldn't let us
take no baggage. we was goin' to columbus, georgia, but we didn't know
dat.
"li'l missy, when we got dar, whar he was a-takin' us, we foun' the big
wages to be fifty cents a month, and dat fine house tu'ned out to be mo'
like a stable. instid of our cabin and gyarden and chickens and our
trees, we had a turrible place, right out under the hot sun wid watah
miles away down a hill. and he wan't no gent'man from de no'th!
"missy, i nebber will be able to tell myself whut made us do hit no mo'
den i'll ebber be able to tell how skeered i was one night when de wind
howled an' de lightnin' was sprayin' ober de place an' de rain was so
turrible hit was a-sobbin' in de fire. we knowed de debbil was ridin' de
win' dat night.
"we was a-sittin' dar befo' de fire, me an' my ol' woman, when we heard
a stompin' like a million horses had stopped outside de do'. we tipped
to de do' an' peeked out an', li'l missy, whut we seed was so turrible
our eyes jes' mos' popped out our haid. dere was a million hosses all
kivered in white, wid dey eyes pokin' out and a-settin' on de hosses was
men kivered in white too, tall as giants, an' dey eyes was a-pokin' out
too. dere was a leader an' he heldt a bu'nin' cross in his hand.
"when we seed dat, we fell on our po' knees, skeered mos' to def an' we
axed de great marster to holp two po' ol' niggers an' holp 'em quick.
"de fust thing we knowed dem ku kluxes had de gen'man from de no'th out
of his hidin' place 'hind our house an' a-settin' on one of dem hosses.
dey nebber spoke wid him. dey jes' tuk him off somewhar, we nebber
knowed whar, but he di'n't come back no mo'.
"li'l missy, we heard arterwards dat dis gen'lman from de no'th was no
qual'ty a-tall. dat he was de wu'st leadah of all de debilment bein'
done; one of dem carpet-baggin' men.
"nex' day arter de ku kluxes cotched dis man, his wife lef' columbus in
a hurry, sayin' she couldn't sociate wid de columbus ladies 'caze dey
was so po'. dey wa po'! dey is no denyin' that. we was all po' caze the
yankees done ruint columbus. but, li'l missy, dey's a big dif'ence in
bein' po' an' qual'ty and' bein' jes po' white trash.
gabe hines, eufaula, alabama
"what did i do then? well, li'l missy, we lef' columbus arter whut
happen'd an' we walked to eufaula, whar twas safe to be. for forty yeahs
i w'uked for de city and anna, she tuk in washin'. endurin' dat time we
was gettin' along pretty likely, when one day gabriel blew his horn for
anna, and gabe was lef' alone.
"my ol' woman's gone. li'l missy, mos' ev'y one i knowed is daid. dis
heah cabin ain' home to me no mo'. hits lonely ev'y whar. maybe i'd
orter be thinkin' 'bout canaan, but hits ol' times crowds dis ol'
darkey's heart. li'l missy, may be whin i gits to whar anna is hit will
be ol' times all ovah ag'in."
adeline hodges
personal interview with 'aunt' adeline hodges
 frye street, mobile, alabama
—ila b. prine, [hw: mobile?]
'aunt' adeline, a tall, gaunt, bright-skinned negro woman, lives on frye
st., mobile, ala. the day i called she was nodding in a cane bottom
rocking chair on a wide porch that extended across the front of a
cottage almost hidden in a grove of giant oaks. she opened her eyes,
which were covered by a pair of steel-rimmed glasses with one lens badly
cracked. the news that a search was being made for old people who had
lived during slavery days acted like an electric shock on the old woman,
who immediately sat up straight and said:
"lor, yes'm, i libed in dose days, and i tells you i 'members all 'bout
dem. do come in and set down. de fust white people i b'longed to was a
man named jones, who was a colonel in de war, but i can't tell you much
'bout dem, 'caze i was jes' a li'l gal den. i was jes' big 'nuff to tote
water to de fiel' to de folks wukking and to min' de gaps in de fence to
keep de cattle out when dey was gatherin' de crops. i don't 'spec' you
knows anything 'bout dose kind of fences. dey was built of rails and
when dey was gatherin' de crops dey jes' tuk down one section of de
fence, so de wagons could git through.
"a'ter de war broke out ole mister jones went off to hit, and i 'members
de day he lef'. he come to de fiel' to tell all de han's goodbye, wid a
big white plume on his hat. dat was in bolivar county, mississippi.
a'ter ol' mister jones lef' for de war, den de nigger drivers an'
oberseer begun to drive us 'round lack droves of cattle. every time dey
would hyar de yankees was coming dey would take us out in de woods and
hide us. finally dey sold us a'ter carrying us away from bolivar county.
some of us was sold to people in demopolis, alabama, an' atlanta,
georgia, an' some to folks in meridian and shubuta, mississippi. i
don't any more know whar my own folks went to dan you does.
"i 'members afore leaving ole mister jones' place how dey grabbed up all
de chillun dat was too li'l to walk and puttin' us in wagons. den de
older folks had to walk, and dey marched all day long. den at night dey
would strike camp. i has seen de young niggers what was liable to run
away wid dere legs chained to a tree or de wagon wheels. dey would rake
up straw and throw a quilt ober hit and lie dat way all night, while us
chillun slep' in de wagons.
"when us come to de big river at demopolis, alabama, i 'members seein'
de big steamboats dere, and dey said dat de sojers was goin' away on
dem. hit was in demopolis us was sold, and a man name ned collins of
shubuta, mississippi, bought me."
'aunt' adeline said that the houses the slaves lived in on the jones
plantation were board houses, and that mr. jones owned a big plantation
and lots of slaves. she said that they had home-made beds, nailed to the
walls, with mattresses made out of shucks.
after having been sold to mr. collins, of shubuta, mississippi, 'aunt'
adeline said that life was very hard, not so much for herself, but she
saw how hard the other slaves worked. she was the house girl and helped
clean house, wash dishes, and take care of the children. after finishing
that work, she had to spin thread. each day she would have to spin so
many cuts, and if she did not finish the required number, she was
punished.
she said that her mistress kept the finished work on top of a large
wardrobe, and 'aunt' adeline said that many times she would steal a cut
of thread off that wardrobe to complete the day's task to keep from
being punished.
as she grew older she did have to go to the field and pick cotton.
'aunt' adeline does not remember it pleasantly. she said:
"i jes' hates to hab to weigh anything today, 'caze i 'members so well
dat each day dat de slaves was given a certain number of pounds of
cotton to pick. when weighing up time come and you didn't hab de number
of pounds set aside, you may be sho' dat you was goin' to be whupped.
but hit wasn't all bad times 'caze us did hab plenty to eat, 'specially
at hog killin' time. dey would hab days ob hog killin' and de slaves
would bake dere bread and come wid pots, pepper, and salt. a'ter
cleanin' de hogs, dey would gib us de livers and lights, and us would
cook dem ober a fire out in de open and hit sho' was good eatin'. de
usual 'lowance a week of pickled pork was six or seven pounds, and iffen
you had a big family of chillun dey gib you more. den dey gib you a peck
of meal, sweet 'taters, sorghum syrup, and plenty of buttermilk. at
christmas times, dey gib you extra syrup to make cakes wid and sweet
'taters to make 'tater pone. and, lor', dey would hab big cribs of
pun'kins. hit makes me hongry to think 'bout dem good ol' pun'kin pies.
"and did dey raise chickens? you knows in mississippi dat de minks was
bad 'bout killin' dem. i 'members one time de minks got in de chicken
house and killed nearly every chicken on de place. ole mister jones had
de cook to clean and cook dem, and he come out in de fiel' an' eat wid
dem to let de slaves know dat hit was all right. den us had dem good ol'
cushaws and lye hominy, too.
"de clothes was made out ob homespun in one piece. i 'members i allus
had mine split up de side so i could git 'bout in a hurry. de women had
pantalettes made and tied to dere knees to wear in de fields to keep de
dew off dere legs. de shoes was made of cow hide and was called red
russets. de way dey got dem darker was to take a hog 'gristle' and hang
up in de chimbley. when hit git full of soot, we rub de shoes wid dat.
den dey used de darker shoes for dere sunday best.
"you asked me about huntin'? lor', yes dey hunted in dem times. up in
dem swamps in mississippi dere was bears as big as cows, and deers
aplenty. dey bofe was bad about comin' in de corn fiel's and tearin'
down de corn. you could hyar dem at nights out in de fiel's. dey also
caught plenty of possums and coons.
"of course, us got sick, but dey had de doctor. in dose days de doctor
would cup you and bleed you. i seen a many a person cupped. de doctor
had a li'l square lookin' block of wood wid tiny li'l knifes attached to
hit. on top was a trigger lack is on a gun, and de doctor would put de
block of wood at de nape of dere neck an' pull dat trigger. den he hab a
piece of cotton wid somepin' on hit to stop de blood when he had cupped
you long 'nough. dey would allus gib us calamus (calomel) to clean us
out, and den de nex' mawnin' dey gib us a big bowl of gruel made out ob
meal and milk. den us'd be all right.
"de slaves warn't 'lowed to go to church, but dey would whisper 'roun'
and all meet in de woods and pray. de only time i 'members my pa was one
time when i was a li'l chile, he set me on a log by him an' prayed, an'
i knows dat was whar de seeds ob religion was planted in my min'. today
i's happy to tell folks 'bout jesus and thank him for his goodness to
me. hit won't be long twell i meet him face to face and thank him."
caroline holland
interview with caroline holland
—mabel farrior
"yassuh, i was a slave," spoke aunt carry from her vine-shaded porch at
no.  sharpe street, montgomery, alabama. "i was borned in  on mr.
will wright's plantation on the mt. meigs road. massa will had a big
slave house an' us niggers sho' use to have a good time playin' 'roun'
down at de slave quarters. we had a row of houses two stories high, an'
dey was filled wid all sorts of niggers. when i was twelve year old, i
was made nu'ss fer my mistis's little girl an' at de fus' i couldn't do
nothin' but rock de cradle. i didn't know how to hol' de baby. us
niggers had gardeens (guardians) dat look 'atter us lak dey did atter de
hosses and cows and pigs.
"one night atter we had all gone to bed i heered a noise at de window,
an' when i look up dere was a man a climbin' in. he was a nigger. i
could tell eben do i could scarce see him, i knowed he was a nigger. i
could hear my mistis a breathin', an' de baby was soun' asleep too. i
started to yell out but i thought dat de nigger would kill us so i jes'
kep' quiet. he come in de window, an' he see us a sleepin' dere, an' all
of a sudden i knowed who it was. 'jade,' i whispers, 'what you a doin'
here?' he come to my bed and put his rough han' ober my mouf.
"listen you black pickaninny, you tell em dat you saw me here an' i'll
kill you,' he say, 'i th'ow yo' hide to de snakes in de swamp. now shet
up.'
"wid dat he went to de dresser an' taken mistis' money bag. atter dat he
went to de window an' climb down de ladder an' i didn't do nothin' but
shake myself nearly to death fum fright. de nex' day de oberseer an' de
pattyrollers went a searchin' th'ough de slave quarters an' dey foun' de
money bag under jade's cot. dey tuk him an' whupped him for near fifteen
minutes. we could hear him holla way up at de big house. jade, he neber
got ober dat whuppin'. he died three days later. he was a good nigger,
'peer to me lak, an' de bes' blacksmith in de whole county. i
ke'pa-wonderin' whut made him want ter steal dat purse. den i foun' out
later dat he was a goin' to pay a white man ter carry him ober de line
to de no'thern states. jade jus' had too big ideas fo' a nigger. i us'ta
see jade's ghos' a walkin' out in de garden in de moonlight; sometime he
sit on de fence an' look at his ole cabin, den sometimes he stroll off
down de cotton fiel'. when de lawd git th'ough a punishin' him fo' a
stealin' dat money, i guess he won't make us no mo' visits. he jus' go
right on in heaben. dat's what ghos'tes is, you know; peoples dat can't
quite git in heaben, an' dey hadda stroll 'roun' little longer on de
outside repentin'.
"soon atter dat my gardeen tuk me to tallasse when de massa died. my
gardeen was a good man. he was always a-makin' speeches fo' de slaves to
stay under bondage till dey was twenty-one. one dey he was in front of a
sto' talkin' 'bout de slaves an' a man come up to him an' said he don't
like de way capt. clanton talk (dat was my gardeen's name). capt.
clanton ask him whut he goin' ter do 'bout it an' de man tuk out a
pistol an' kil't de cap'n raght dere on de spot.
"den i was sold to another man, a mr. williamson, 'bout de time de war
broke loose, an' massa williamson tuk me ober ter lib wid some mo'
peoples. he said he had mo' slaves dan he could take keer of. dis was de
abernathy plantation. while de massa was a standin' in de slave quarters
a takin' to mr abernathy, i noticed a boy wid a bad eye. i didn't lak
him at all an' i tol' de massa i don't wanna stay, kaze i didn't lak de
way dat boy lum wid de bad eye looked at me. den mr. abernathy brung a
boy 'bout sebenteen year old; a big strong lookin' boy named jeff. he
say 'jeff, look out after carry here. don't let her git into no
trouble.' fum dat time on till 'bout five year ago, jeff he always look
after me, kaze atter de war i ma'ied him. now i ain't got nobody but
myself."
jane holloway
interview with jane holloway
—preston klein, opelika, alabama
jane holloway was ill. for weeks she had been in bed, and the untidy
condition of her cabin brought profuse apologies when i entered.
"jane, do you remember me?" i asked.
"i don't know, honey. i been sick so long wid de fluse i can't 'member
much of anything," she answered peering up at me from her pillow.
suddenly she smiled, "shucks. co'se i 'members you, honey. your daddy
sho' was good to my boys. watt worked for him so long. res' yourself in
dat cheer and i'll tell you all about myself and slavery times what i
can recollect.
"i'se all alone now 'ceppen for my grandson. he ain't but
twelve and he can't ho'p much. but i guess i got no right to complain
i guess i done got me plenty outa life.
"i was borned up in north alabama. my mammy was carrie holloway and my
pappy was traylor holloway. i had a brother maryland. dere nebber was
but de two of us. us lived in a mud and log house, jes' one room but it
sho' had a big fireplace. us had a good old time den, effen us jes' had
knowed it, 'caze us was always fed good. dey had long wooden troughs
what dey poured our bread and milk in and us eat it wid a wooden spoon.
when dey yell, 'chillun, chillun! bread!' you bet we jes' burnt de wind
getting dere, 'caze us was always hongry.
"we had high tester beds in all de houses, what was 'bout a mile from de
big house. it had four rooms and was all planked up. mr. billy taylor
was mighty good to his niggers. he didn't have so many slaves, he jes'
had a little plantation. our oberseer was good, too. he had to whip
some of dem sometimes, but dey wouldn't work. dey brung it all on
deyselves.
jane holloway, opelika, alabama
"when de yankees come enduring de war, de men come arunning and a
screaming dat de yankees coming. and dey did come on horseback and took
all our provisions what was in de smokehouse. dey took everything we had
in de way of victuals and stock, too.
"i j'ined de church when i was ten years old, 'caze i was trying to live
right and do what de bible said. de white folks had deir services in de
morning, and in de evening would let us niggers have ourn."
jane forgot her misery long enough to come out to the porch of her
comparatively comfortable cabin and she was "plumb proud" to have her
"picture took."
joseph holmes
personal interview with joseph holmes
grand avenue, prichard, alabama
—ila b. prine, mobile, alabama
standing in the middle of the road at prichard, suburb of mobile, and
gesticulating while talking to a small group of interested listeners an
old negro man ended his talk to the small gathering and punctuated his
last sentence with a spat of tobacco.
"no'm," he continued after i had put in my appearance and asked him a
question, "i doesn't know whether i was a slave, but jus' de same i seed
gen'l grant's army when it went th'ough virginny. jus' as sho' as you is
standin' dar, lady, i seed dem mens all dressed in blue suits,
a-marching' side by side, gwine down de road pas' our place. it tuk 'em
three days to go by our house.
"an' i remembers when dem yankees came to our ole mistis' house an' take
a ladder an' clumb up to de roof an' tear de boards outter de ceilin' to
git dem big hams an' shoulders my white folks done had hid up dar. when
de yankees find dat stuff dey give it all to de niggers. den atter de
solgers lef' ole miss called us to her an' tol' us we was free, but for
us to give back some of de meat an' things dat de yankees done give us,
'ca'se she didn't have nothin' to eat 'roun' de place. 'course we was
glad to do it, 'ca'se mistis sho' was good to us.
"i remembers ebery sunday mawnin' dat she'd make de older slaves bring
all de little niggers up to de big house, so she could read de bible to
'em, and den she give us plenty of dem good biscuits and taters dat
susanne cook for us. she'd say: 'git 'roun' dere, susanne, and he'p dem
little niggers' plates.' i really thought mistis was a angel.
"talkin' 'bout niggers bein' free. ole miss tol' us was free, but it was
ten or twelve years atter de surrender befo' i knowed whut she meant. i
was a big boy goin' to school befo' i had an understandin' as to what
she meant.
"ole miss taught de niggers how to read an' write an' some of 'em got to
be too good at it, 'ca'se dey learned how to write too many passes so's
de pattyrollers wouldn't cotch 'em, an' on dem occasions was de onlyes'
times dat i ever seed one of our niggers punished.
"mistis never 'lowed no mistreatin' of de slaves, 'case dey was raisin'
slaves for de market, an' it wouldn't be good bizness to mistreat 'em.
lor' miss, my white folks was rich; dey had as many as five or six
hundred niggers; men, women an' chilluns. de plantation was big, but i
doesn't remember how many acres it was, but i does remember dat de
cabins was all built in rows, an' dere was streets laid out among de
cabins. de chimneys was built outten dirt an' sticks, an' you know up in
virginny it got powerful cold, so when dey built de cabins dey th'owed
dirt up under 'em to keep de wind an' snow out.
"i was bawn in henry county, virginny, near danville, an' i's been to
vicksburg an' petersburg a many a time wid my pappy to de wheat an'
'bacca market. lor', honey, virginny is de bes' place on earth for good
eaten' an' good white folks. if anybody tells you dat de white folks was
mean to dere niggers, dey neber come from virginny, 'case us was too
near de free states, an' i done already tol' you dat dey raised niggers
to sell an' dey kep' 'em in good condition. in dose days white folks an'
black folks was black folks. jus' lak booker t. washington was a riber
between de niggers of dis generation an' learnin'. he had all dat was
fine an' good, an' he give de bes' to his people iffen dey would take
it. dat was de way wid de white folks den; dey didn't do no whuppin'.
"i's de onlyes' rat lef' in de pond, an' 'case i ain't hung in de smoke
house, folks thinks i's not as old as i say i is, but chile, i's been
here a long time. i 'members how black sam useta preach to us, an' when
i growed up i useta think warnt nobody christians cep'n us babtists, but
i know better now, an' de longer i lives de mo' i realizes dat de
churches go 'way 'case dey leaves off de ordinances of god, although us
has a bible an' mo' christian readin' dan ever befo'.
"my mammy's name was eliza rowlets an' my pappy's was joseph holmes. my
pappy had de same name as de peoples dat owned him an' my gran'mammy
name was lucy holmes. gran'mammy holmes lived to be over a hundred years
old, an' she was de fust pusson i ever seed daid. in dem days it tuk
three days to bury a pusson, 'case dey dug de graves as deep as de
corpse was tall.
"land sakes a-livin', us had great times, an' i forgot to tell you dat
us had home-made beds wid two sides nailed to de wall an' de mattresses
was made outen wheat straw.
"as for huntin' i done plenty of it an' one thing i got to git
forgiveness for was when i lef' virginny, i lef' 'bout fifty or sixty
snares set to cotch rabbits an' birds.
"my mammy had eight chilluns an' we was raised in pairs. i had a sister
who come along wid me, an' iffen i jumped in de river she done it too.
an' iffen i go th'ough a briar patch, here she come along too.
"'bout de fruit; it makes my mouth water to think about dem cheese
apples, dat was yaller lak gold, an' dose abraham apples, an' de cherry
tree as big as dese oaks here. i's eaten many a big sugar and sweetheart
cherry. but dere was another kind called de gorilla dat growed as big as
de yaller plums down dis way. now let me tell you somp'n 'bout virginny;
'dey had dere laws 'bout drink. dey had de bes' peach an' cherry brandy
an' mos' any kin' you eber heared of, but dey didn't 'low you to make
drink outten anything you could make bread wid; sich as corn or rye. us
had our brandy same as you would coffee, 'case it was cold, an' some
mawnin's my pappy would git de brandy out an' my mammy would putt a
little water an' sugar wid it an' gib it to us chilluns. us neber
thought nothin' 'bout drinkin'. i kinda believes lak dat ole infidel
ingersoll who said dat anything dat was a custom was dere religion.
"now you axed about hog-killin' time? dat was de time of times. for
weeks de mens would haul wood an' big rocks, an' pile 'em together as
high as dis house, an' den have several piles lak dat 'roun' a big hole
in de groun' what had been filled wid water. den jus' a little atter
midnight, de boss would blow de ole hawn, an' all de mens would git up
an' git in dem pig pens. den dey would sot dat pile of wood on fire an'
den start knockin' dem hogs in de haid. us neber shot a hog lak us does
now; us always used an axe to kill 'em wid. atter knockin' de hog in de
haid, dey would tie a rope on his leg an' atter de water got to de right
heat, fum dose red-hot rocks de hog would be throwed in an' drug aroun'
a while, den taken out an' cleaned. atter he was cleaned he was cut up
into sections an' hung up in de smoke house. lawsie, lady, dey don't
cure meat dese days; dey jus' uses some kind of liquid to brush over it.
we useta have sho' 'nuff meat.
"den come cawnshuckin' time. my goodness, i would jus' love to be dar
now. de cawn would be piled up high an' one man would git on dat pile.
it was usually a kinda nigger foreman who could sing an' git de work
outten de niggers. dis fo'man would sing a verse somp'n lak dis:
polk and clay went to war,
polk come back wid a broken jaw.
den all de niggers would sing back at him wid a kinda shoutin' sound.
near 'bout all de times de fo'man made up his own songs, by pickin' dem
outen dat shuckin'! it war de jug dat dey brung aroun' eve'y hour. dat's
de onlyes' time de slaves really got drunk.
"in dem ole days i went to plenty of dances an' candy pullin's durin' de
yule season, but i doesn't do dat no mo'. i's a preacher an' when i fus'
lef' virginny, i come to georgy an' stayed dar twenty years whar i
kicked up plenty of dus'. i even taught school dar. den i come to
alabamy an' lived in evergreen for 'bout twenty mo' years. since i been
in mobile i's worked for sich men as ole simon, damrich, an' van
antwerp, an' all dere chilluns has been in dese here arms of mine. i's
been a square citizen an' dere hasn't been a time dat i is had to call
on nobody but uncle sam when ole man 'pression cotched me. but thank de
lawd i is still able to git about an' have all my senses 'cep' my
eye-sight, an' it's jus' a little po'ly. i is got all my teeths 'cep'
one, an' my mammy was always proud of my hair. see how silky an' fine it
is? not quite white, dough. i hope i lives long enough for it to turn
white as snow. i think st. peter will lak it better dat way."
personal interview with joseph holmes
grand avenue, prichard, alabama
—ila b. prine, mobile, alabama
in the middle of the road near prichard, an incorporated suburb of
mobile, stood an aged negro man, gesticulating as he told a tale of
other days to a small audience. tall, straight, with gray hair and
mustache, he was a picturesque figure. he does not know whether he was
born in slavery, he said, but he knows his age to be about eighty-one.
"i doesn't know whether i was a slave, but jes' de same i seed gineral
grant's army when hit went th'ough virginny," he said "jes' as sho' as
yo' is standin' dar, lady, i seed him, and i seed dem men all dressed in
dem blue suits a-marchin' side by side, gwine down de road pas' our
place. hit tuk dem three days tuh git pas' our house.
"an' does i 'member when dem yankees come tuh ol' mistiss house an' tuk
a ladder an' clim' up tuh de roof an' tear de boards outta de ceilin'
tuh git dem big hams an' shoulders dey had hid up dar? i sho' does. de
women folks makes de slaves hide wid de meat; an' when dem yankees fin'
dat stuff dey jes' gib hit all tuh de niggers, an' i 'members too, how
ol' miss calls us all to her atter dey lef' an' tole us dat us was free,
but she tole us dat us hab tuh gib back ob de meat an' 'serves 'case she
didn't hab a bit tuh eat. 'cose we was glad tuh do hit 'case ol' miss
sho' was good tuh her slaves.
"i 'members ebery sunday mawnin' dat she made de older slaves bring all
de little niggers up to her big white, two-story house, so she could
read de bible to us, an' den she gib us plenty dem good biscuits an'
'taters dat she had de cook, susanne, cook for us. she'd say 'git 'roun'
dere, susanne, an' he'p dem li'l niggers plates,' i, railly thought ol'
miss was an angel.
"talkin 'bout niggers bein' freed, ol' miss tole us us was free, but hit
was ten or twelve years atter de surrender, befo' i knowed whut she was
talkin' 'bout. i was a big boy goin' to school befo' i had any
understanin' as tuh whut she meant.
"ol' miss taught de niggers how to read an' write, an' some ob dem got
to be too 'ficient wid de writin', 'case dey larn how tuh write too many
passes so de pattyrollers wudn't git dem. dat was de onliest time i
ebber knowed ol' miss tuh hab de slaves punished.
"ol' miss nebber 'lowed no mistreatin' de slaves, case dey was raisin'
slaves for de market, an' hit wouldn't be good business to mistreat 'em.
lor' mah white folks was rich; dey had as many as five or six hundred
niggers, men, women and chillun. de plantation was big but i don't
'member how many acres i does 'member de cabins was all built in rows,
an' streets was laid out 'tween de cabins. de chimbeys was built outta
dirt an' sticks, an' sticks, an' yo' know up in virginny hit got
turrible cold an' de snow would pile up, so when de cabins was built, de
men th'owed dirt up under de house to keep de snow an' cold out. yo'
might think dat dirt would wash out from under de house, but hit didn't.
hit jes' made dem so warm an' com'fo'ble we did'nt suffer.
"dat was de way wid de white folks den; dey didn't do no whippin' an'
mistreatin' ob de slaves. oh, once in a while ol' miss might slap de
cook's face an' tell her tuh bear down 'roun' dere, an' if she wanted de
servin' boys to hurry, she would say 'cutch hit,' meanin' fer dem to cut
some steps an' git 'bout in a hurry.
"i's de ol'est rat in de pon', an' 'case i ain't hung in de smokehouse,
folks think i's not as ol' as i says i is, but chile, i's been heah. i
'members how sam useta to preach to us, when we was at ol' miss's place,
an' when i growed up, i 'members how i useta think nobody was a
christian 'ceptin' us baptists, but i knows better now. an' de longer i
lib de mo' i realize dat de chu'ches go away 'case dey leabes off de
ordinances ob god, 'tho us has got de bible an' mo' christian
litterchoor dan eber befo'.
"my ma's name was 'liza rowlets, an' mah daddy's name was joseph holmes.
my daddy had de same name as de people whut owned him, an' my gran'ma's
name was lucy holmes. gran'ma lucy libed to be a hundred yeahs old, an'
she was de fust pusson i ebber seed daid. hit tuk three days tuh bu'y a
pusson den, 'case dey dug de graves as deep as yo' is tall, which means
mo' than five feet deep. lor' sakes a-livin' us had great times. i
forgot tuh tell yo' dat us had home-made beds wid two sides nailed tuh
de wall, an' de mattresses was made outta wheat straw. dat's 'minds me
dat dere wa'n't no pore cattle in dem times, 'case yo' could go whar dey
thresh de wheat an' git all de straw yo' wanted an' feed de dry cattle
on hit. an' you wouldn't believe de fruit us did hab! yo don't nebber
see de like down dis way. sich as apples, cherries, quinces, peaches an'
pears.
"as fer huntin', i done plenty of it, an' one thing i got to git
forgiveness fer was when i lef' virginny, i lef' 'bout sixty or seventy
snares set to ketch rabbits an' birds.
"my ma had eight chillun an' we was raised in pairs. i had a sister who
come along wid me, an' if i jumped in de ribber tuh swim, she did hit
too; if i clum' a tree, or went th'ough a briar patch, she done hit
right behin' me. ma wanted to know why her clo's was so tore up, an'
when dey was pretty, we'd make hit right wid ma by havin' a rabbit or
coon wid us, an' sometimes a mud turtle. an' as fer 'possums an' coons,
us ketch dem in plenty.
"'bout de fruit, hit makes mah mouf watah tuh think 'bout dem cheese
apples dat was yaller lac' gold, an' dose abraham apples de lack of
which ain't now to be had. an' dose cherry trees as big as dese oaks,
wid long limbs an' big sugar an' sweetheart, an' black heart cherries.
den dere was annudder kin' of cherry called de gorilla, dat was roun'
an' growed as big as de yaller plums down dis way.
"now, let me tell yo' sumpin' 'bout virginny. hit had hits own law 'bout
drink. dey made de bes' peach an' cherry brandy an' mos' any kin' yo'
ebber heerd ob, 'ceptin' dey didn't 'low yo' to make drink out ob
anythin' you could make into bread. now yo' understan's, sich as corn
and rye.
"us had our brandy same as yo' would coffee, 'case hit was cold an' some
mawnin's us would git up an' de snow would be halfway up de do', an' de
men would hab to ditch hit out, so us could git out of de house. on dem
rail cold mawnin's my daddy would git de brandy out an' my ma wud put a
li'l water an' sugar wid hit an gib to us chillun. an' den she'd take
some in her mouf' an' put hit in de baby's mouf an' hit wud open hits
eyes an' stamp hits foot rail peart lack.
"us nebber thought nothin' of drinkin'. i kinda believes lack dat ol'
infidel, ingersoll, who said dat anythin' dat was de custom, was de
religion.
"folks was a heap kinder-hearted den dey is now, 'case dey kep' big dogs
to hunt up people los' in de snow. dey all seemed mo' happy 'case dey
was all busy. at night instid of wastin' dey time, dey wud go tuh de big
house an' spin an' weave an' make clo's.
"i kin hyar dat ol' loom hummin' now, an' see great cards ob cloth
comin' out, an' dem was clo's den dat was made from hit. hit tuck fire
tuh git dem offen' yo' dey was so strong. i doesn't 'member whut dey
used fer dye, but i knows dey used copperas as sizin' to hol' de colors.
some of de cloth was dyed red, blue an' black. i jes' can't 'member
'bout de dye, but dey used copperas. 'dat was the qualification of de
intelligence ob de primitive age', in usin' dat copperas. dey not only
made our clo's, but also made out hats. of co'se dey wa'n't very hatty,
but was mo' cappy. dey made 'em wid tabs ober de ears, an' to tie under
de chin, an' was dey warm, i'll say!
"now, when yo' axes 'bout hawg killin' time, dat was de time! fer weeks
de men would haul wood and big rocks, an' pile hit all together as high
as dat house; den hab sev'ral piles like dese 'roun' a big hole in de
groun' whut had been filled wid watah. den jes' a li'l atter mid-night
de boss would blow de ol' horn, an' all de men would git up an' git in
dem hog pens. den dey would set dat pile of wood on fire, an' den start
knockin' dem hawgs in de haid. us nebber shot a hawg like dey does now.
us allus used an ax to kill 'em wid.
"atter knockin' de hawg in de haid, dey would tie a rope on hits leg, an
atter de water got to de right heat from dose red hot rocks whut had
been pushed out ob dat pile ob nu'in wood into de watah, dey wud th'ow
de hog in an' drag hit aroun' awhile, an' take him out an' hab him clean
in 'bout three pair o' minutes. atter he was clean dey hung him up, an'
den later cut him up an' hung him in de smoke house, an' smoke him wid
great oak logs. huh, dey don't cu'ah meat now, dey jes' use sum kinda
brush an' liquid, but dey don't hab meat lack us did.
"den come co'shuckin' time. mah goodness, i jes' would love to be dere
now. de co'n would be piled up high an' one man would git on dat pile.
hit usually was one who was kinda niggah fo'man dat could sing an' get
de wuck out of de odder niggers. dis fo'man would sing a verse somethin'
lack dis:
polk an' clay went to war,
an' polk come back wid a broken jar.
"den all de niggers would sing back to him, an' hallo, a kinder shoutin'
soun'. ginerally dis fo'man made up his songs by pickin' dem up from
whut he had heard white folks tell of wars. but miss yo' know whut was
de motor powah of dat co'n shuckin'? hit was de ol' jug dat was brung
'roun' ebery hour. dat's de onliest time any ob de slaves railly got
drunk.
"i wish i could 'member dose ol' songs, but all dat hallo done lef' me,
'case de onliest singin' i hears now is de good ol' sisters singin' an'
sayin' 'amen.'
"in days gone by i went to plenty of dances an' candy pullin's but i
doesn't do dat any mo'. i's a preacher, an' when i fu'st lef' virginny i
come to georgia an' stayed dere twenty yeahs, an' i kicked up a plenty
of dust in georgia. i eben taught school an' built a plenty of chu'ches
dere. den i come on to alabammy, an' libed in evergreen fo' about twenty
mo' yeahs, an' i built a two-story brick chu'ch dere. since i's been in
mobile i's wu'ked by dat bienville squah for twenty-eight years, for
sich men as ol' man simon, damrich, an' van antwerp, an' all dere
chillun has been in dese arms. i's been a squah citizen an' dere hasn't
been but one time in mah life i's had to call on anybody, an' dat was
when i had tuh call on uncle sam when ol' man depression got me. but
thank god i's still able to be 'bout an' have all my faculties, 'ceptin'
my eyesight is a li'l porely. i still has all mah teeth, 'ceptin' one,
an' my ma allus tuck pride in mah haih, yo' see how fine an' silky hit
is, an' hit ain't snow white yit. dere is one thing to be thankful fer.
dat is 'case i's so near home."
josh horn
interview with josh horn
—ruby pickens tartt, livingston, alabama
seven miles east from livingston on state road no. , thence left two
miles via a dim road through the woods to a cultivated section, the
beginning of a large plantation area, stands the old-timey cabin of josh
horn, a well known and influential figure in the colored community.
vigorous and active despite his more than  years, josh exemplifies the
gentleness with which time deals with those dwelling in a healthful spot
and living the simple lives of a rural people. i found him nodding on
his front steps.
"josh," i said, "i've come to get you to tell me some old war-time
stories, and i want to ask you some questions about you and alice and
how you-all are getting along. i just want to know all about you and
your family as far back as you can remember."
"all right, miss ruby, i's glad to tell you what i knows," said josh,
"and it ain't gonna be a lot of fibbin', but jes' lak everything was.
i's telling you lak you axed me.
"now, 'bout how us is getting along. i's telling you de troof, ef i was
took 'fore god, i'd say jes' lak i's saying now, ef my chillun ever et a
moufful dat wasn't honest, dey et it somewhar else, 'ca'se i ain't ever
stole a moufful somepin' t'eat for 'em in all my life. it's honest
vittles dey et, and varmints i's killed in de woods, 'ca'se us raised
chillun fast, and us had a heap of 'em, sixteen, if i 'members right,
and soon's i found out dat i could help feed 'em dat way, i done a heap
of hunting. and everybody knows i's a good hunter. alice used to make me
go every friday night; den us always had a 'possum or two for sunday."
"why," i asked, "didn't you go saturday night?"
"well, i'll tell you," josh said, "alice is a good christian woman, and
she knowed i'd hunt mighty nigh all night, and she didn't want nobody
see me coming in sunday morning wid no gun and no dogs; so i went every
friday night and went in de week too, and dat holp a lot to feed de
chillun. i don't owe nobody, not a nickel.
"i lak to got in debt, when de government come in and tried to help us
wid dat cotton doings. dey cut it down so on me, tell i couldn't make
nothing; but i's getting on all right now, and so is my chillun. us is
got fourteen living, and dey's all been to school, but ain't but one
been to booker washington's school, but dey kin all read and write, and
some of 'em teaching school out here in de country. de doctor, he come
clear out here to see us, 'ca'se i always pays him. he jes' here wid
alice last night. it's nine mile and two of dem's back here in de woods
through marse johnnie's place, but he come when us went atter him 'bout
midnight, and dat's a comfort to know he come."
i asked, what was the matter with alice.
"well, i'll tell you, miss ruby. she was back dere wid me in de
kitchen, and i got through eating and i come out and set down in de
swinger to git some air. de moon was shining, and alice come out,
saying loud as she could: 'who is you? who is you?' de chillun run
to her wid a lamp and i run, and 'twan't nobody dere. well, alice said
'twas a big man standing right 'side her dressed in black, and she
called it death. us couldn't do nothing wid her, and she didn't know
nobody, me nor de chillun, so i went to livingston atter dr. mccain,
and he come and set wid her 'bout a hour. he said 'twas de 'cute
'digestion or somepin' lak dat. i knowed 'twan't no sperrit; i don't
b'lieve in nothing lak dat."
"well," i said, "i don't know, josh, i've been hearing some ghost tales
that freeze the blood in my veins."
"yassum," said josh, "if you wants to hear ghost tales, i kin sho tell
'em, ca'se i seed dis here wid my own eyes. 'tain't no made-up nothing,
needer; jes' somepin' i seed jes' lak i tells you.
"green hale and isham mathews b'longed to new hope church, and de
reverend bird hall pastored dere. dey axed me down to hear him preach
one night, and us three, me and green and isham, was riding along side
and side. i's riding a mule, but it was a fast mule, and green couldn't
keep up, en isham said: 'somebody been hunting.' i looked up and 'twas a
sapling right 'cross de road. he said, 'fellow oughten leave nothing lak
dat. when de moon git low, it hit him in de face.' de moon was straight
up and down den, and i said: 'dat's right', and i's telling you de
troof, dat sapling jes' riz up, turned aroun' in de air, en de brush
part tickled my mule and isham's hoss in de face. if you ever seed 'em
buck and rare and jump up, dey sho did. den dey took off down de road,
and we didn't hold 'em back, and here come green. we lef' him behind,
'cause his mule couldn't keep up. if you ever heard a man pray more
earnester dan old green, i ain't! he come down de road a-yelling: 'lord,
us live togedder, let us die togedder.' he meant for us to wait on him,
but i couldn't hold dat mule, and i wan't trying to hold him! i was
gitting away from dar!
"when us come togedder, us was a mile from whar us done been, den us had
to decide what to do. isham said for us to go wid him, and green said
no, us nearer to his house; but us wan't near to nobody and i was so
scared, hadn't been for alice, i'd a jes' stayed right whar us was 'tell
sun-up. i said, 'no, every man better take keer his own self,' en us
did. when i got home, i didn't take nothing off dat mule but myself. i
jes' left him standing at de do' wid de saddle on. what skeered green
so, was a man, he said, what was ridin' right 'side him en didn't have
no head! 'twas a good thing he didn't tell me dat den, i'd jes' nacherly
drap dead!
"no'm, i don't 'zackly believes in ghosties, but i heared mr. marshall
lee say he was riding on home one night and a woman stepped out in de
road and say: 'marshall, let me ride.' he say: 'my hoss won't tote
double.' she say: 'yes it will,' and she jump up behind him, and dat
hoss bucked and jumped nigh 'bout from under him, but when he got home,
she wan't dere. he say, his sister had jes' died and it mout been her.
"'nother time, one friday night, alice say us better git a 'possum for
sunday. she say she didn't want none caught atter midnight on sadday. i
went down whar i knowed dey was 'simmons, and dem dogs never treed
nothing; dey jes' run 'round dat 'simmon tree lak dey gone crazy. i'm
telling you de troof, somepin' jump outer dat tree, had a head back'erds
and for'erds and look lak a flame shooting out it eyes! 'twan't lak no
possum i ever seed, 'twan't lak nothing. dem dogs, liz and roger en
cuba, made a bluge at me. cotton was waist high, and i run down de
cotton row and cross de road and dey trail me. i say: 'what ail you,
dogs?' and dey jes' come on a-barkin', and dey run me to de bridge over
konkabyer. so i clumb on de banisters. i seed dey had my trail an dey
gonna ketch me, so i turn 'round and tore out for de slough. dey lost my
trail dere and when i got home, 'bout daylight, de thorns and de briars
and all done tore my clothes plum off me. 'twas t'ree days 'fore i ever
seed dem dogs ag'in.
"and i kin tell you somepin' else. it's jes' lak i say, i's always been
a hunter, en one night i went down in de post oak woods hunting by
myself. dis is a fact; 'tain't no lie. it's what i done. i had a mighty
good dog, and i jes' kept walking and walking, and i got mighty nigh to
mr. redhead jim lee's place, and i walked on and atter while i seed i'd
lost my dog. i couldn't see him nowhar and i couldn't hear him nowhar,
and den somepin' say to me, jes' lak dis: 'josh, blow your horn!' jes'
lak dat, lak somebody talking to me. well i give three loud, long blows
and set dere awhile longer but dat dog didn't come. co'se i knowed he'd
come sometime, and so i jes' set dere on dat log and i jes' turned a
fool, i reckon, but 'twas jes' lak somebody talking to me, lak it
'peared to me was whispering: 'josh, you out here in dese woods by
yo'self. you blowed dat horn and your enemy heard you. you's a fool, you
is.' and i whispered back: 'dat's a fact.' i couldn't hear what it was
a-whispering to me, but us jes' talk back to one 'nuther, and 'bout dat
time i look up and here come three men ridin' on new saddles wid shiny
buckles gwine, 'squeechy, squeechy', jes' lak dat. i hears de hosses
feed jes' as nachel as could be. i thought sho i seed 'em, and it 'pears
to look clean outer reason, but dem men come riding right on up to me,
and i jump over dat log and lay down flat on de other side, and it look
lak i could see right through dat log and heard 'em say: 'dar he is, dar
he is', and i seed 'em p'inting dey finger right whar i was. i knowed
dem hosses gwineter step over de log on top me, and i's telling you de
troof, i jump up from 'hind dat log and run 'bout two miles, and if it
hadn't been for dat slough, i don't know whar i'd a went. i come to
myself in de middle of dat water, up to hyar, waist high, and dar was my
dog, old cuba, done treed a 'possum.
"de fust thing i 'members 'bout slave'y time, i wan't nothing but a boy,
'bout fifteen i reckon, dat's what marse johnnie horn say. us belong to
marse ike horn, marse johnnie's pa, right here on dis place whar us is
now, but dis here didn't belong to me den, dis here was all marse ike's
place. marse ike's gin got outer fix and we couldn't get it fixed.
colonel lee had two gins and one of 'em was jes' below old turner house.
recolleck a big old hickory tree? well dar's whar it was.
"i was plenty big 'nough to drive de mules to de gin. set on de lever
and drive 'em, jes lak a 'lasses mill, so dat night marse ike told us he
want everybody go wid him to colonel lee's gin nex' morning, and didn't
want nobody to git out and go ahead of him. dat held up de ginning; made
us not go to de ginhouse tell sunup.
"us got de mules and jes' waited. 'twixt daylight and sunup, us all
standing dar at de gate and we heared a little fine horn up de road. us
didn't know what it meant coming to de house. and bimeby mr. beesley,
what live not fur from marse ike, he rode up and had five dogs, five
nigger dogs, what dey call 'em, and soon as he come, marse ike's hoss
was saddled up and marse ike and him rode off down de road and de dogs
wid em, 'head of us. us followed 'long behind 'em, stay close as dey
'low us, to see what dey was up to. when dey got close to de ginhouse,
ginhouse right 'side de road, dey stop us and mr. beesley told old brown
to go ahead. old brown was de lead dog and had a bell on him and dey was
fasten togedder wid a rod, jes' lak steers. he turn 'em loose, and den
he popped de whip and hollered at old brown and told him 'nigger'. old
brown hollered lak he hit. he want to go. and dey was a fence on bofe
sides made it a lane, so he put old brown over de fence on de ginhouse
side, and told brown to 'go ahead'. he went ahead and run all aroun' de
ginhouse and dey let him in de gin-room and he grabbled in de cottonseed
in a hole.
"den somebody holler 'guinea jim', i looks and i didn't see him. didn't
nobody see him, but dey know dat's whar he been hiding. mr. beesley
told old brown he jes' fooling him, and old brown holler ag'in, lak he
killing him, and mr. beesley say: 'go git dat nigger' and old brown
started 'way from dar lak he hadn't been hunting nothing, but he went
aroun' and aroun' dat gin and mr. beesley told him he hatter do better
dan dat or he'd kill him, 'cause he hadn't come dar for nothing.
"brown made a circle aroun' dat gin 'way down to de fence dat time, and
he was so fat he couldn't git through de fence. you know what sort of
fence, a rail fence it was. den he stop and bark for help. now i seed
dis wid my own eyes. dey put brown on top de fence and he jump way out
in de road, didn't stay on de fence. he jump and run up and down in de
road, and couldn't find no scent of jim. you knows how dey used to make
dem rail fences?
"well, brown come back dar, and dis is de trufe, so help me gawd. he
bark, look lak, for dem to lift him back up on de fence, and bless god,
if dat dog didn't walk dat rail fence lak he walking a log, as fur as
from here to dat gate yonder, and track jim jes' lak he was on de
groun'. he fell off once, and dey had to put him back, and he run his
track right on to whar jim jumped off de fence way out in de road. old
brown run right cross de road to de other fence and treed ag'in on
t'other side de road toward konkabia. old brown walk de fence on dat
side de road a good piece, jes' lak he done on de other side, and dem
other dogs, he hadn't never turned dem loose.
"when brown he jump off dat fence, he jump jes' as fur as he kin on de
fiel' side, lak he gwine ketch jim lak a gnat or somepin' and he never
stop barking no more, jes' lak he jumping a rabbit. den, mr. beesley
turn dem other dogs loose dat he hadn't never turned loose, 'ca'se he
say old brown done got de thing straight. and he had it straight. dem
dogs run dat track right on down to konkabia and crossed it to de
blacksher side. dey was a big old straw field dar den and dey cross it
and come on through dat field, all dem dogs barkin' jes' lak dey looking
at jim. 'reckley, dey come up on jim running wid a pine brush tied
behind him to drag his scent away, but it didn't bother old brown.
"when dem dogs 'gin to push him, jim drap de brush and runned back
toward konkabia. now on konkabia dere used to be beavers worse den on
sucarnatchee now. dey was a big beaver dam 'twixt de bridge and de hale
place, and jim run to dat beaver dam. you know when beavers build dey
dam, dey cut down trees and let 'em fall in de creek, and pull in trash
en brush same as folks, to dam de water up dar tell its knee-deep. de
dogs seen him, old brown looking at him, jes' 'fore he jump in 'bove de
dam right 'mongst de trash and things dey'd drug in dar. brown seed him
and he jump in right behind him. jim jes' dive down under de raff, en
let he nose stick outer de water. every once in a while jim he put he
head down under, he holding to a pole down dar, and once mr. beesley
seed him, he jes' let him stay dar.
"brown would swim 'bout 'mongst de brush, backerds and for'erds, and
terreckly mr. beesley tole old brown, 'go git him.' den all de men got
poles and dug 'bout in de raff hunting him. dey knowed he was dar, en
marse ike had a pole giggen aroun' trying to find him too. den he told
mr. beesley to give him de hatchet and let him fix he pole. he sharpen
de pole right sharp, den marse ike start to jug aroun' wid de pole, and
he kinder laugh to hisse'f, 'ca'se he knowed he done found jim. 'bout
dat time jim poke he head up and say: 'dis here me', and everybody
holler. den he ax 'em please, for god's sake, don't let dem dogs git
him. dey told him come on out.
"you see, jim belonged to miss mary lee, mr. john lee's ma, and his pa
was kilt in de war, so mr. beesley was looking out for her. well, dey
took jim outer dar, and mr. beesley whipped him a little and told him:
'jim, you put up a pretty good fight and i's gwine to give you a start
for a run wid de dogs.'
"jim took out towards miss mary's, and mr. beesley helt old brown as
long as he could. dey caught jim and bit him right smart. you see dey
had to let em bite him a little to satisfy de dogs. jim could have made
it, 'cept he was all hot and wore out.
"dat's 'bout all i knows, 'cept us belonged to marse ike horn, and fust
us belonged to mr. price williams, what run de hotel in livingston. he
took my gran'ma to mobile, den he died. us ma belonged to dey two
chillun, miss nancy gulley, mr. jake's wife, en miss burt blakeney.
marse ike horn was dey uncle, and us all come 'round to him, and us been
here ever since. my mammy was ann campbell, and my pappy was john horn,
and us ain't never had no trouble wid nobody 'bout nothing.
"we's having a barbecue on de fo'th of july and us wants you to come
down to it, if alice gits along well, and i's gwine tell you 'bout rod
and big john, and john graverson when dey runned away and about how old
man jim devers, alice's step-pa, hid em in de cave under he house whar
dey had as nice hams as i ever et, co'se a little tainted, but sho was
good. dem niggers was fat as beavers, jes' settin' dar eatin' dat meat.
"and 'bout de time marse ike slip up on a heap of niggers at a frolic
'twixt sumterville and livingston and put a end to de frolic. de niggers
having a big dance, and marse ike and de patterrollers having a big run,
said dey wanted to have some fun, and dey did. said he eased up on 'em
wid a white sheet 'round him and a big brush in he hand, and somehow or
'nother, dey didn't see him tell he spoke. den he holler 'by god, i'm
bird-blinding,' and he say dem niggers tore down dem dirt chimleys and
run t'rough dat house. he say he ain't never heerd sich a fuss in a corn
field in his born days. what he mean 'bout bird-blindin'? when you goes
in de canebrake it so thick, you takes a light to shine de bird's eyes
and blind 'em, den you kin ketch 'em. dat what he call bird-blindin'.
yassum, marse ike in dat too. he couldn't stand for 'em to have no fun
'thout he in it.
"come back on de fo'th of july, and i's gwine tell you some sho-nuff
tales. you sort of caught me when my min' wa'n't zackly on it. i ain't

my triump' jes' begun.
"you come back and i'll sing de res', i's got to see 'bout things
now."
emma l. howard
interview with emma l. howard
—margaret fowler, fruithurst, alabama
"mammy, is ol' massa gwin'er sell us tomorrow?
yes, my chile.
whar he gwin'er sell us?
'way down south in georgia."
'aunt' emma l. howard sat in a huge, old-fashioned rocking chair at her
home,  elmwood st., montgomery, and sang the old slave song. when she
had finished, her memory recalled the time, years ago, when she was a
slave on the plantation of william and georgiana shepherd in lowndes
county, between mac's switch and morgansville.
"dat was one of de saddest songs we sung endurin' slavery days," she
mused. "it always did make me cry."
she thought a moment, smiled.
"i 'members i was de only light nigger in de fambly," she said proudly.
"i was brung up in de house wid de white chillun. twice a week i went to
my mammy's cabin an' took a bath. i had my own sof' shoes an' my own
nightgown an' jacket an' played games wid my massa's chilluns."
she explained her duties about the big house as sweeping the rambling
porches and yards. sometimes she churned. afterward she would join the
white children and played most of the day.
"we played hot-scotch, ring-'roun'-the-rosy an' lots of yuther things i
can't 'member," she explained. "i musta been 'bout seven years old den."
emma says she is  or , but she looks older. she remembers very
little about her brothers and sisters. she can only recall "sist'
cellie, sist' harriett an' sist' liza." liza helped aunt evalina in the
kitchen.
emma lifted her eyes toward the ceiling, endeavoring to recall the
exact number of servants her master owned.
"edie was de laundress," she recalled, "an' arrie, she was de weaver.
den dere was becky, melia, aunt mary, ed, john, and uncle george the
house man, who married aunt evalina. jake was de over-looker (overseer).
he was a great, big cullud man. dar was more, but i can't 'member. i was
jes' a little shaver den."
she remembers that the big house was huge and white with a beautiful
parlor and guest room, where the visitors were entertained. gigantic
white columns rose in front of the house, and clusters of magnolias
surrounded it. the slave houses were located about two hundred yards
back of the house.
"massa shepherd an' mistis georgiana was both good an' treated de
servants kin'," emma said. "i 'members dat i used to keep de flies offen
mistis georgiana wid a big fan, an' once i went to sleep. she jest laugh
when she foun' me sleepin' dar beside her.
"massa would only whup a slave fer two things," she recalled. "one thing
was if things warn't done up jes' right at hog killin' time, and de
other was iffen a nigger warn't clean when he 'ported for work on monday
mornin's. ol' massa didn't do de whuppin's hisse'f. jake did it, but
massa sat dar on his horse to see dat only a certain number of licks was
give.
"how did we feel 'bout a white man who would be over-looker? we called
him 'po white trash.' he wasn't thought much of by anybody."
emma said that everyone went to church on sundays and that she liked to
sing the old religious hymns. when freedom came all the shepherd
servants had been taught to read and write, she said, and each family
had enough money to buy a little home. "de marster" would make each
family keep pigs, hens and such; then he would market the products and
place the money aside for them, emma explained.
talking further about work about the plantation, she said:
"louisa cleaned de parlor an' kept mistis' room nice." she took up a
recital of work on the plantation. "atter dat she didn't do anything but
sew, an' sist' liza hoped her wid dat. after de weavin', we done sewin',
and it took a lot of sewin' for dat family. eve'body had two sunday
dresses, summer and winter, as well as clothes for eve'day.
"for de men's suits de wool had to be took off an' carded an' got ready
to make. but we had plenty of wool from our own sheep.
"when dey kilt de hogs for winter meat, dey took some of de hands out of
de field an' let dem ho'p. we had a smokehouse full of hams and
middlin's, an' when rainy spells came, us chillun would rake up chips
an' leaves an' make a smudge of smoke to keep de meat sweet.
"massa shepherd and miss georgiana was both mighty kin' hearted an'
treated their servants good. once when marse shepherd sent us chilluns
down to de station wid a note, he say, 'now, go fas'.' but we played
'long the way an' picked flowers. when we come steppin' back, he say, 'i
told you to hurry.' i held out de flowers an' say, 'see, us brung you
some flowers;' but he take up a little switch an' nettle my legs good.
"massa always give us plenty of eve'thing. on friday us worked an'
washed, an' on sattidy us cleaned for sunday. den on sunday massa would
go 'roun' an' have a mouthful at every house to see dat eve'thing was
done up jes' right, an' if they wasn't, somebody got a whuppin' next
day.
"when us went to church on sunday, massa shepherd, miss georgiana an' us
three chilluns rode in de rock-a-way. dat was a carriage shaped mos'
like a bowl. de carriage was pulled by two big horses, an' de coachman
what sat up on de high seat had on a long double-breasted coat, shiny
black boots an' a tall silk hat. massa had on a silk hat, too, but he
wore a tight-waisted coat. an' miss georgiana, she look lak a bokay.
emma l. howard, montgomery, alabama
"she didn't lak to wear hoops, because she had sprained her ankle once
an' walked wid a limp. she liked to wear thin, cool, flowery dresses wid
lots of ruffles an' lace. she also wore a scoop of white straw, mighty
sof' over de years' an' flarin' high an' spreadin' over de face. it was
filled wid flowers an' tied wid long streamers of ribbon."
emma said that mr. shepherd died during the second year of the war, and
that it was whispered he was poisoned because he was so good to his
niggers. "just before the war closed," she said, "mrs. shepherd married
again and later moved to texas.
"i was took on as a cook by a rich family named marchiel, in
montgomery," she said. "dey treated me lak i was deir own daughter. i
was 'lowed to go out three nights a week, but no more, an' i had to be
home by 'leven o'clock.
"i got engaged to be married an' de boy had to ax for me. i 'member dat
massa marchiel say: 'if you don't take good care of her i'll take her
back.' when de younges' daughter married she lef' me her veil an'
wreath, an' dey give me a weddin' dress an' shoes.
"my husban' was a carpenter, an' we lived in dis house. when he died, i
went to work for a family dat once was de richest family in de state.
dey comes to see me every few days, an' nex' week dey are comin' for me
to spen' de day wid dem. de reason i has stayed so well is dat folks has
always been so good to me."
everett ingram
interview with everett ingram
—preston klein, opelika, alabama
uncle everett ingram mused: "honey chile, my gran'mammy was de beatenest
woman to have chilluns dat you ever seen. i has hyared dat she raised so
many of dem dat she brung a mighty heap on de block; somewhere near a
thousan' dollars."
uncle everett is a familiar figure in east opelika, where he has lived
for years. he was "a right good-sized scamp at freedom time" and
remembers much of what he has seen and heard. he was born in russell
county, the son of prince and fanny ingram. they had seven other
children; jerry, clara, rubin, jep, lula, eugene and lucy.
everett says of his life:
"our house in de slave settlement was made of logs an' had one room. it
had a mud an' stick chimney, a plank floor an' a boxed-up bed wid one
leg at de foot. de mattress was stuffed wid shucks an' straw.
"my gran'pappy, prince walden, an' lucy, his wife, come from russell
county, too, an' belonged to de covingtons. later dey was sold to dr.
walden, at uchie. when dey come to uchie de county was full of indians.
my gran'pappy useta drink likker wid 'em; but gran'ma, she was skeered
an' runned away to columbus, georgy. on her way dere, my mammy was
borned in de woods.
"i 'members dat when i was a strip of a boy, dey cooked ash-cake on
leaves an' de chilluns et pot-licker an' bread an' greens outen wooden
trays wid wooden spoons. dey would sit under de trees an' eat. each
family had dey own bowl, an' us et a-plenty, too. in cold weather mammy
kept all de chilluns in de house by de fire.
"master had us a two-room house, 'ca'se my mammy was de cook an' weaver.
dey made dey own silk den, too, an' raised de silk worms. us useta get
mulberry leaves to feed de silk worms wid. us used indigo, which us
cooked an' used for dye. us would wear any kind of clothes on everyday
an' sunday; an' didn't have no shoes 'til us was big chilluns.
"ol' marster an' ol' mistus, mr. bill an' miss lucy ingram, lived in a
big weather-boarded house wid a wide hall an' a chimney at each end. de
kitchen was off from de rest of de house.
"i 'members dat de overseer useta whip mammy an' pappy, 'ca'se dey fight
so much. he useta take my mammy to de carriage to whip her. marster was
in de war den. when he come home, de overseer tuk mammy by de han' to de
house an' tell marster 'bout havin' to whip her. he'd jest shake his
head, sad-lak. he was mighty good to all of us.
"my gran'pappy was put in de speculator drove, put on de block an' sold.
"i 'members dat mistus read de bible to us an' my mammy was converted by
de white preacher. he baptized her. de colored folks used de white
church an' set in de back.
"an' honey, dey shorely did have good times dancin' on sattidy nights;
an' sometimes dey would dance 'till sunday mornin'. when de corn needed
shuckln', it was hauled up near de crib, an' on a purty moonlighted
night marster would pass 'roun' de likker. it wouldn't be long 'til dey
was all happy an' had what dey called a general. de general led all de
hollers an' songs. dey shorely did get dat corn shucked fast, too.
"gran'mammy was a great doctor; useta give us turpentine an' castor oil
an' jerusalem oak fer worms. she'd give us all kinds of teas, too. i
'members dat gran'mammy was also a midwife.
everett ingram, opelika, alabama
"de yankees comed through de yard in may an' tol' us: 'you's free.' de
yankees wasn't so good. dey hung my mammy up in de smokehouse by her
thumbs; tips of her toes jest touchin' de floor, 'ca'se she wouldn't
'gree to give up her older chilluns. she never did, neither.
"daddy stole both de older chilluns, dough, an' went off. de yankees
stole provisions an' stock an' hauled 'em off. de news got to uchie an'
everybody hid out; marster wid 'em. dey hunted de money whut was hid in
de colored folks beds; nearly $,. de jewelry was dere, too. dey
foun' some money at de big house an' said: 'dis money ain't worth a
damn;' but dey tuk it jest de same.
"i married hattie graves. den i j'ined de church an' was
saved."
hannah irwin
interview with hannah irwin
—gertha couric, [hw: eufaula?]
on a high knoll overlooking the winding chewalla creek is a little one
room shack. its rusty hinges and weather-beaten boards have seen many a
glowing sunset; have stood against many high winds and rains; they have
for many years sheltered aunt hannah irwin, ex-slave. now the old negro
woman is too old and feeble to venture very often from her small home.
she lives almost in solitude with her memories of the past, and an
occasional visit from one of her old friends who perhaps brings her some
fruit or a little money.
"yas'm, i'll be pleased to tell you 'bout whut i remembers aroun' de
time of de war." aunt hannah sat stolidly in a chair that virtually
groaned under her weight; and gave utterance to this sentiment through a
large thick mouth, while her gold ear rings shook with every turn of her
head, and her dim eyes glowed with memory's fires. "dere ain't much i
can tell you, dough," she went on, "kaze i was only twelve years old
when de war ended.
"i was bawn on marse bennett's plantation near louisville, alabama. ma
mammy's name was hester an' my pappy was named sam.
"i remembers one night raght atter de war when de re'struction was
a-goin' on. dere was some niggers not far fum our place dat said dey was
agoin' to take some lan' dat warn't deres. dere massa had been kilt in
de war an' warn't nobody 'ceptin' de mistis an' some chilluns. well,
honey, dem niggers, mo' dan one hundred of 'em, commenced a riot an' was
a-takin' things dat don't belong to 'em. dat night de white lady she
come ober to our place wid a wild look on her face. she tell massa
bennett, whut dem niggers is up to, an' widout sayin' a word, massa
bennett putt his hat on an lef' out de do'. twarn't long atter dat when
some hosses was heered down de road, an' i look out my cabin window
which was raght by de road, an' i saw acomin' up through de trees a
whole pack of ghosties; i thought dey was, anyways. dey was all dressed
in white, an' dere hosses was white an' dey galloped faster dan de win'
raght past my cabin. den i heered a nigger say: 'de ku klux is atter
somebody.'
"dem ku klux went ober to dat lady's plantation an' told dem niggers dat
iffen dey ever heered of 'em startin' anything mo' dat dey was a-goin'
to tie 'em all to trees in de fores' till dey all died f'um being
hongry. atter dat dese niggers all 'roun' louisville, dey kept mighty
quiet.
"no m'am, i don't believe in no conjurin'. dese conjure women say dat
dey will make my hip well iffen i gives 'em half my rations i gits fum
de gover'ment, but i knows dey ain't nothin' but low-down, no-count
niggers."
"speaking of the ku klux, aunt hannah. were you afraid of them?"
"naw'm, i warn't afeered of no ku klux. at fu'st i though dat dey was
ghosties and den i was afeered of 'em, but atter i found out dat massa
bennett was one of dem things, i was always proud of 'em."
hannah irwin, [tr: eufaula?], alabama
"well, what about the yankees?" she was asked. "did you ever see any
yankees; and what did you think of the ones that came through your
place? were you glad that they set you free?"
"i suppose dem yankees was all right in dere place," she continued, "but
dey neber belong in de south. why, miss, one of 'em axe me what was dem
white flowers in de fiel'? you'd think dat a gent'men wid all dem
decorations on hisself woulda knowed a fiel' of cotton. an' as for dey
a-settin' me free! miss, us niggers on de bennett place was free as soon
as we was bawn. i always been free."
martha jackson
interview with martha jackson
ruby pickens tartt, livingston, alabama
"when de war fus' started," said martha jackson, who was born in ,
"dey wouldn't let none of de cullud people go to chu'ch 'thout dey had a
pass, and mighty few white folkses would give 'em a pass. dere was a
heap of men (hit mou't have been six or twelve, my recollection is
short, but anyhow 'twas jus' a big crowd) whut went back'erds en
ferwerds jes' lack sher'fs and de calls de'se'fs de 'patterrollers.' ef
de white folks give de niggers a pass, den dey could go, and ef dey was
to go'thout one, dem patterrollers would have 'em a-runnin' thoo de
woods jes' lack dey was a lot of deer, an ef dey ever cotch 'em, dey'd
take 'em to dey marster and he'd jes' natchelly wear 'em out!
"den dey didn't 'low 'em for to go nowhurs much, eben when de plantation
j'ined one ernudder did, dey'd ketch 'em over dere and fetch 'em back
and dey'd git whooped ag'in, and dat's 'zackly how come a heap uv 'em
run'd away. i knowed a nigger onc't whut was gone nigh 'bout a year, and
he wa'n't gone nowhur but right up de big road a piece, livin' in a cave
whut he dug outer de side uv a clay bank. and miss betty say, 'marthy,
whur you reckon dan at?' and i never said nothin'. de patterrollers
couldn't fine him or nobody, and he ain't never showed hisse'f in
daylight 'tel he peered up atter de s'render.
"and i knowed a woman name tishie, miss mollie's house sarvant. she run
away 'case dey so mean to her, i reckon, and de cullud folks harbored
her and hid her up in de grain house wid de peas and sech lac', stedder
down in de corn crib. and who ever 'twas 'trayed her i ain't sayin' but
a crowd uv dem patterrollers come and got 'er one night, and tuck her
away, and i ain't nebber seed tishie no mo'.
"and one uv ole marsa's niggers—'little boy' he go by—he tuck on
might'ly, 'case dey say he wanted to marry tishie. i know he fotch her
up in de quarter fer ter git her sumpin' to eat atter de white folks
done sleep. but couldn't nobody marry, 'twa'n't 'lowed, 'outer one or
t'other uv de ole marsa 'greed to buy bofe uv 'em and ef dey didn't
'gree you sho' better keep 'way fum dey place. and ole marsa and miss
mollie didn't nebber 'gree.
"i hear some uv 'em say one dem patterrollers had 'bout three sets er
cullud chillun over dere, and some uv 'em favor'd tishie, and ev'y time
hit come time fer 'em yaller gals ter work in de fiel', dey got sarnt
norf. i reckon 'case he never wanted see his own blood git beat up, and
dat jim barton was er cru'l overseer, sho's yer bawn.
"'twas a heap of dem yaller gals got sarnt norf frum 'roun' here sho'
was."
martha says most of the meaness of pre-war days on the plantations may
be charged up to cruel overseers.
"ole marsa's wife's sister had a husband whut kep' de meanest overseer
durin' de war dat i ever is seed," she declares. "dat man would make 'em
niggers on de plantation plow up a gre't big fiel' big as all over
yonder and den check hit fer corn. and checkin' corn in runnin' a
straight row clean 'cross de fiel' bofe ways, and hit make a check 'bout
two feet square. den he'd make de niggers drap a grain uv corn right in
de middle uv ev'y check, and ef hit didn't come up straight as deese
here fingers on my han', he'd snatch hit up and make 'em eat hit right
den and dere, stalk and all 'thout ever bilin' hit a anything. and
that'll mighty ne'r th'ow you in de middle uv a spell uv sickness sho's
yo' bawn.
"but dat didn't make no diffe'ns to dat man. and stidder dat, he'd nigh
'bout beat 'em ter deaf ef dey 'sputed his word 'bout hit, but den dey
didn't 'spute, 'case dey was so skeered when dey drappin' hit dat hit
ain't gwinter come up straight lack he say, dat dey couldn't drap hit
good as dey could uv drapped hit. 'case dey so skeered dey couldn't.
"dem niggers jes' natchelly shuck lack dey havin' de black ague chill
soon as dey heered him a-comin'. and when de patterroles tole him de
niggers was a-risin', 'case dey foun' papers 'bout in de cabins, he nigh
'bout kilt 'em. some of dem niggers run 'way down in de woods lack deers
and clam' up in de trees, 'case he sot dogs on 'em and some uv 'em
stayed in a cave in de clay bank and tuck to comin' up to us house
nights after vittles. and dat overseer man would send 'em patterrollers
jes' lack dey was de sher'f down to fotch 'em back, and he'd say, 'dead
or alive, doan' make no diffe'nce.' and sometimes dem dogs be done nigh
'bout chewed dem niggers up. den he'd whoop 'em sho' 'nuff.
"'twas a long and a wide stiff leather strop w'at he had whut hung back
uv his do', and hit had big roun' holes in hit, and he'd git him a pot
of warm salty water and set hit down by his side. den he had 'em cotch
de nigger and put his feet in de long block, and somebody helt dey
han's, and he strip 'em stark naked, and he stretch 'em 'cross a log,
and he dip de long stiff leather strop wid de roun' holes in hit in de
briny salt water, and den look out 'case he comin' down on dat po'
nigger's nekkid bottom. de holes in de strop dey sucks flesh up in th'oo
'em, and de nigger's a hollerin' and ev'ybody so skeered dey right ashy,
and dey can't nobody say a mumblin' word 'case dey so skeered.

hilliard johnson
interview with hilliard johnson
—ruby pickens tartt, livingston, alabama
uncle hilliard johnson and his wife callie live on the johnson place
about three and a half miles from livingston, ala., the same place
hilliard was brought as an infant of two in slavery days. he and callie
tend their own little patch of ground and they own a mule. white friends
patch up the gaps in their financial structure and everybody knows them.
uncle hilliard pulled up his mule in front of my house and climbed down
from the high seat, leaving callie sitting placidly in the sun.
he came around to the kitchen door and announced that he was here,
"'ca'se he got de word i wanted to ax him somepin."
"uncle hilliard," i said, "i want to hear all about you and your family
and whom you belonged to in slavery time."
"well, miss ruby, iffen you is knowed me all dese years and still don'
know who i'm is, and my family is, and who us belonged to, dey ain't no
use of me stoppin' now to tell you. 'sides, i's sick, i's been to de
horspital in york, dr. hills', and he wants to operate. i's skeered of
de knife and ain't got no money neither.
"i can't eat nothin' but tomato soup. dem sho' is nice ones
you got dere on de she'f, and oyster soup and rice soup and all lac
dat. can't eat no rough vittles lac collards. i ain't gittin' on
well atall, but i'll 'blige you a while. i was thinkin' other day
'bout you and dem ole sperichel hymns i leads out to mount pilgrim.
you's got 'oh lord, i'm a waitin' on you', ain't you? i knowed you
had dat 'bout 'and i can't do nothin' until you comes. sho can't.'
well, here's one you ain't got, 'ca'se hit's a really old sperichel
my gran'maw use to sing. i's sorter hoarse today, but hit go:
jes' carry me and bury me
i'll rise at de comin' day.
jes' carry me and bury me,
i'll rise at de comin' day.
"now dat's jes' de chorus and de verse say:
when i was in my worldly ways
nobody had nothin' to say.
now i'm ridin' de pale white hoss
ev'ybody got something to say."
"den de chorus ag'in, and hit's a pretty one sho's you bawn."
i mentioned the figure of speech "pale white hoss", but he "didn't know
nothin' 'bout no figures!"
"and another one, dey is so many, let me see. here one but i jes' can't
call to mine a heap of verses:
trouble here and dey's trouble dere,
i really do believe dere's trouble ev'ywhere.
swing low, chariot, i'm gwine home.
swing low, chariot, i'm gwine home."
"den hit goes on and tell 'bout de moaner, says:
oh, dey's a moaner here, dey's a moaner dere,
i really do b'lieve dey's a moaner ev'ywhere.
swing low, chariot, i'm gwine home.
swing low, chariot, i'm gwine home.
oh dey's a sinner here, dey's a sinner dere,
i really do b'lieve dey's a sinner ev'ywhere.
swing low, chariot, i'm gwine home.
swing low, chariot, i'm gwine home.
oh, dey's a christun here, dey's a christun dere
i really do b'lieve dey's a christun ev'ywhere
swing low, chariot, i'm gwine home.
swing low, chariot, i'm gwine home.
"den dey's a heap of 'em to dat song lac a "deacon" and a "member" and a
"prayer" and a "singer", jes' a whole passel dem verses, but i reckon
dem will do today.
"now what else you want, 'ca'se dem mules is tired and i is too. 'sides
i got to see a man and callie in de waggin and she's hot too. you knows
callie, she my wife, my second wife, and us got twelve chillun in all,
growed and married. us still live on de johnson place three and a half
miles from livingston right han' side de ole boyd road west from town.
us belonged to miss ella johnson, she was us young mistis, and mr. nep
johnson, dat's de onliest ones i ever knowed. my mammy, frances
johnson, and my pappy, alf johnson, come from down 'bout cubie station.
young mist'iss bought 'em i reckon and my gran'maw, rachel johnson. fus'
thing i knowed, us was livin' on johnson place. dey was good to us,
'bout seventy-five of us all together, i reckon. all i 'members, dey
looped de bridle rein over my feet an' let de mule drag me all over de
orchard. it hurt my head. and dey beat some of 'em up scan'lous, but dey
was pretty good to me, i reckon. see, i wa'n't so ole, jes' a young boy
in slavery time, but i recall young massa told tom, a young nigger dere,
one time not to go to de frolic.
"'clean up dem dishes and go ter bed,' he say. and tom said 'yassuh' but
marse nep watch tom th'oo de do' and atter while tom slip out and away
he went, wid young massa right 'hin' him. he got dere and foun' tom
cuttin' groun' shuffle big as anybody. young massa called him, 'tom,' he
say, 'tom, didn't i tell you you couldn't come to dis frolic?' 'yassuh,'
says tom, 'you sho' did, and i jes' come to tell 'em i couldn't come!'
"young massa didn't hurt tom none, but i is seed 'em strip 'em plum
nekked and nigh 'bout kill 'em. i did see 'em kill old collin, but dey
done dat wid a shot gun jes' 'ca'se dey couldn't control him. did they
have nigger dogs, you say? yassum, dey sho' did, but i'm tellin' you de
troof now some of de black folks knowed how to git away from dem nigger
dogs jes' lac dey wa'n't dere. mr. joe patton, you know mr. joe patton
don' you? young mr. joe, i'm talkin' 'bout what's over here in town and
use to be de sher'ff. well, in his day, he done seed a nigger hoodoo dem
dogs 'ca'se dey had nigger dogs after s'render too. i kin tell you what
i seed, but what dey done now, i doan' know, i couldn't tell you dat.
but hit was a fair day, fair as 'tis now, and dey sot de dogs on dat
nigger and 'fo' yer knowed hit dat nigger done lef' dere and had dem
dogs treein' a nekked tree. 'twa'n't nobody dere. dey calls hit
hoodooin' de dogs. and i'se seen hit more times than one. time i tell
you 'bout, mr. patton was ag'in. 'twas a feller right here in town. i
forgits his name but he was a tall nigger, married dennis coleman's
daughter. you 'members dennis coleman, had dat gal call hettie? well, he
married hettie, and he whooped her up mightily. she 'ported on him to de
sheriff, and he went to git him. i can't think what dat nigger go by
now, but anyhow mr. patton couldn't ketch him and he sot de dogs on him
and dey couldn't ketch him. dey knowed whichaway he went, down 'bout
bear creek on miss mamie smith's place in de flatwoods. 'twa'n't no
trouble to ketch nobody down dere, but dem dogs couldn't do hit, and
fus' thing you know he run back to hattie's.
"now jes' give me a few tomatoes, miss ruby, and i mus' cut dis short.
dey's a cloud comin' up over yonder by peter's washpot and dat's when us
gits a rain. i got a fur piece to go for a old man. yassum, i'se nigh
'bout seventy-nine years old and porely."
randolph johnson
interview with randolph johnson
—morgan smith, [hw: birmingham?]
randolph johnson, age , although he admits he was "jes' a little
picaninny" when the war between the states began, still recalls with
vivid clarity the days of his childhood on the old plantation. unlike
most of the former slaves, he never worked hard. his hours were too
filled with the joy of playing, for he belonged to a little crippled boy
about his own age and guarded over him all the time. at night the little
white master and his small black playmate slept in the same room; the
latter having a pallet that he spread on the floor. during the day both
little white and black played in the shade of the cedars on the grassy
lawn. the kindly white owner of the plantation was always good to
randolph. never a cross word was spoken to him, he says.
"but one day," randolph said, "de little massa took very sick. dey
wouldn't even let me see him. i had a feelin' trouble was a comin', kaze
little massa neber did have no real life like other boys. he was always
a lookin' lak a sick puppy. i gues de lawd jus' wanted him fo' hisself,
and he took him.
"adder dat i was put to work on a mule dat turned de wheel of de cotton
gin. he jus' walk aroun' in circles lak de mule dat's pullin' a syrup
press. den de war came, and all de good clothes dat we had made on de
loom turned to tatters. de food got low; some of de slaves run away and
some of our houses was burned by de yankees. atter de war, de massa came
back and told us niggers dat we waunt slaves no mo'. said we could go,
but if we wanted to stay we could do dat too. he gib' each fambly dat
stayed a mule, a cow, some tools and money enough to run 'em till dey
could git de crop harvested. he was de best massa dat any nigger ever
had.
"den i come to bummin'ham. i worked on de railroad dey was puttin'
through. i was a big nigger and i could make de others step. i was about
six feet three inches and weighed near  pounds. i knowed my ole massa
would have been proud of me if he coulda seed me a-workin' on de
railroad and a liftn' dem ties and a sweatin' wid dem rails; i wished i
coulda been in his cotton field and a-heard him talkin' fair like instid
ob listenin' to dat foreman gibin' us de debil 'bout bein' lazy when we
was a workin' our selfs nearly to death. den one day i saw de foreman
slap a nigger fo' drinkin' at de dipper too long. de nigger picked up a
shovel and slam him in de haid, and run. back in de slabery days dey
didn't do somethin' and run. dey run befo' dey did it, kaze dey knew dat
if dey struck a white man dere want goin' to be no nigger. in dem days
dey run to keep from doin' somethin'! nowadays dey do it and den dey
runs."
abraham jones
interview with abraham jones
—g.l. clark
a lot of water passes under the bridge in  years. i thought of that
as i talked to abraham jones, -year-old ex-slave of village springs,
alabama. "uncle abe" says he was born august , , in russell county,
alabama. perhaps the day, the month and the year may not be exactly
accurate. but they are near enough. he recalls the falling of the stars,
the removal of the indians from russell county and the settlement of
auburn and other towns in that section. his great age is not apparent in
his looks, actions or natural faculties. his hair is thin and white, but
no more so than that of many men half his age, and his hearing is good.
the mellow voice so characteristic of his race, is strong. he stands as
straight as a soldier. and he works regularly to earn a living for his
family. when we found him he was laying a flagstone walk in hard clay
soil, and there was power in the swing of his pick and his tamping ax.
his regular daily chores include milking a cow and chopping wood.
abraham jones, village springs, alabama
he describes the phenomenon of falling stars as an event that occurred
when he was "a little shaver 'bout eight year' old." november , 
was the date.
"yes, sir, i saw de stars fall. some folks say dey didn't never fall but
i seen 'em. dey fell jest like pitch from a torch, 'z-z-z-z-zip,
z-z-z-z-zip!' and big cracks come in de ground. i was settin' on de end
of de porch, and i watched 'em. dere was so many grown people crowdin'
into de house, 'twa'n't no use fer me to try to git in so i jest sot
still. we had a big sill under our house, more dan a foot thick, and so
many people crowded in de house till dere weight broke de sill. dey was
cryin' and hollerin' but de stars didn't hurt nobody; dey jest fell and
went out, and i don't know where dey went den; maybe into dem cracks in
de ground. de cracks stayed a long time and it was dangerous for de
people to go about at night; dey might fall into de cracks. one of dem i
remember was two feet across and so deep dey couldn't find no bottom wid
a long pole. i reckon dem stars kept fallin' for about a hour. folks
thought de end of time was comin' and ever'body got right after dat.
"back at dat time de country was not settled much and dere was lots of
indians. my grandpappy was a full-blooded indian but i don't know what
kind. de indians was good people but if dey thought you had done 'em
wrong dey'd kill you right now. i saw some of dem when dey left dat
country. dey women carried de babies in some sort of sacks, hung down in
front of 'em, and de men carried some of de bigger chillun on dey
shoulders. dey didn't have no property—jest lived wild in de woods.
abraham jones' back yard, village springs, alabama
"a few years after de stars fell, a passel of people from de other side
of columbus, georgia, moved over and started de town of auburn so dey
could have a place for a school.
"before de war my people took me up to blount county, and when de war
come dey left me to run de grist-mill. i was de fust man in alabama to
try to grind a bushel of oats. i ground 'em too. a lady brung de oats
and ast me could i grind 'em, and i told her i would try. she say dey
didn't had nothin' for de chillun to eat. i ground de oats, and told
her, 'ole mistis, i knows jest how 'tis and i'll be glad to give you a
peck of meal if you will use it.' she say, 'of course i will; jest put
it in with the oat meal, and i sure will appreciate it.' her husband
was off to de war and she didn't had no way to feed de chillun.
"i was workin' on de road a long time after de war and was tellin' de
men about dat when her son hear me. she had told him about it and so he
went home and told her he had found me. she sent word back for me to go
to her house and let her see if i shore 'nuff was de same man. so i went
and when she seen me she say, 'yes, he is the same man,' and she called
her husband and de other chillun and told 'em about it. her husband say,
'well, dey is jest one thing we kin do. if he ever need a place to stay
or vittles to eat, we must see dat he gits dem.'
"in slavery time i belong to massa frank jones, and timothy jones was de
overseer on de place. frank jones had two plantations, de one whar i was
born and another one close to columbus. people ax me sometimes what kind
of house i was born in and i tell 'em i wa'n't born in no house; and i
warn't, i was born in de middle of de big road.
abraham jones' house, village springs, alabama
"it's gittin' to where it's mighty hard for me to go now and do de work
to make sompen for us to eat. i can't git about so fast and my head
bother me a lot. i been workin' a long time now, and you does git tired
after a hundred years of workin'!"
on his wrists were circlets of heavy cord. i asked him why
they were there and he explained:
"to keep de pain out. dey keeps it out purty good but if you can git a
little leather band wid a buckle on it, dat is better yet. i wears dese
all de time."

deaf.
"white folks," she began, "i belonged to marse wiley jones and his wife,
mistis melba.
"i lived in a little two-room log cabin with high tester beds and
mattreses filled with cawn shucks. our food den was away better dan de
stuff we eats today. it was cooked on a fireplace made outen rocks wid
big hooks fastened into de side to swing de pots aroun' on. us cooked
hoe-cakes on a three-legged skillet dat sot ober hot coals an' us had a
big oven for to bake meat an' cawn bread in. dere ain't nothin' lak it
nowdays, no'm.
"ole massa had a big garden an' we useta git de vega'bles we et f'um his
garden. de folks was plenty good to us. sometimes de mens would hunt
'possums an' rabbits an' wild turkeys. we sho' loved dem 'possums
smothered in 'taters.
"an' talkin' 'bout medicines. let me tell you a sho' 'nough cure for a
baby dat's havin' a hard time teethin'. jus' putt a string of coppers
roun' he neck an' he won't have no trouble at all. us useta do dat to de
little white chilluns an' de black uns too; 'specially in hot weather
when dey jus' seem to have de misery.
"atter us got to be big gals, us wo' cotton dresses an' drawses in hot
weather, an' when it git col' we had to wear long drawses an' homespun
wool dresses an' home-knitted socks and shoes dat de cobbler made in his
shop. you know, white folks, we useta make near 'bout eve'ything dat wes
needed to run a body raght on our plantation. us had eve'ything. on
sunday us wo' gingham an' calico dresses an' i ma'ied in a swiss dress.
"i worked as a house gal an' when miss sarah ma'ied i went with her to
nuss her chilluns. besides miss sarah dere was mista billy, mista crick,
miss lucy and miss emma. dey had two uncles an' a aunt of deres lived
dere too.
"we had a happy fambly. at night some of de house niggers would gather
'roun' de fire, an' mistis would read us de scriptures, an' de white
chilluns git tired an' slip out de do' but us little niggers couldn't
'ford to do dat; us hadda stay dere whether us liked it or not.
sometimes de massa let de niggers dance an' frolic on saturday nights,
but we warn't 'lowed to go offen de plantation, none ceptin' de ones dat
had a wife or husban' on anudder plantation; den dey could only stay for
a short time. sometimes us could go off to church, an' i remembers a
babtizin' in de creek. some of dem niggers 'most got demselves drowned.
dey warn't used to so much water an' dey would come up outen de creek a
spittin' an' a-coughin' lak de debil had a holt of 'em. dere was so much
shoutin' i 'spose ever'body fo' ten miles aroun' could hear dem niggers
a-carrin' on in de creek.
"durin' de war, my mammy helped spin cotton for de soldiers' clothes,
an' when de yankees come through, us hid all de valuables in de woods.
us had to feed dem an' dere hosses too. dey et up near 'bout everything
we had on de place.
"dere warn't no schools in dem days for us colored folks. us learned
f'um de scriptures, an' by listenin' to de white folks talk."

would git up an' go to work. dose goin' way down in de fiel's would
have to git up even befo' it was light so's to be dar when de dawn broke
to commence de day's work. den dey would come back at twelve o'clock for
dinner an' res' awhile, den go back an' work till sun down.
"we useta have a man on de place dat played a banjo, an' we would dance

"none of us slaves ever tried to run away to de nawth 'ca'se dey was

"some saddays we had to work after dinner, but most of the time marster
would let us have a good time. on christmas day us had a big celebration
an' didn't do no work at all.
"didn't nobody have no time to learn us how to read an' write.
"i don't know nothin' 'bout mr. lincoln 'cep'n he freed all us slaves,

josephine
interview with josephine
—gertha couric, eufaula, alabama
aunt josephine claims to be the oldest negro in eufaula. she says she
was born ninety-four years ago in north georgia on a plantation above
atlanta. she lives now in eufaula, alabama with a great-granddaughter.
"i used to belong to marse rogers," she said. "after surrender, marse
rogers moved to dis country, and bought a plantation 'twixt marse josiah
flourney's and general toney's. he said his plantation j'ined theirs."
she was a nurse-maid all of her life, even in slave days, and never was
a "field nigger." asked if she saw any soldiers during the war she said
she saw "thousands."
"i and my mistis and her baby hid in de swamps three days while sherman
and his army was passin' through," she explained. "marse rogers was in
virginny and when he got back home, there wasn't nothin' left but a
well. everything had been burned up. his house was gone and so was de
smoke house; everything." she added that the well was a "dry well" where
melons and butter and milk and meats were placed, in summer, to keep
them cool.
"those three days my little brother hid in this well, while the soldiers
were passin'," she said.
"'fore god, missy," she exclaimed, "when we got dat little nigger out ob
dat well, he had almost turned white!"
aunt josephine is still a "nurse maid." she rocks her
great-great-great-grandchildren.
lucindy lawrence jurdon
interview with lucindy lawrence jurdon
—preston klein, lee county, alabama
lucindy lawrence jurdon bustled feverishly about her tiny lee county
cabin when she learned her picture was "goin' to be tuk." she got out
her old spinning wheel; sat down before it and beamed. her daughter
coming in from the field, exclaimed: "ma, i done tol' you dis lady was
comin' to see you; an' you wouldn't believe me."
after she had posed, she seated herself to tell about slavery days. her
oldest grandson was sick in the next room with pneumonia; the cabin was
stuffy and bare.
lucindy said:
"honey, i was borned in macon, georgy, on de twenty-eighth day of some
month or other; i can't 'member which. but de year was .
"my pappy an' mammy, emanuel and patsy lawrence, come from jasper
county, georgy. i had a sister named jennie an' a brother named phillip,
but i was de oldest.
"ol' marster had 'bout three or four hundred acres on his plantation.
his name was marster leroy lawrence, and he shorely was good to all us
niggers. his daddy was mr. billy lawrence; an' de marster had four
chilluns.
"us lived in a two-room log house wid a lean-to next it. us was well off
in dem times, but us didn't have sense enough to know it. i 'members dat
us always had plenty of good victuals.
"honey, us had meat broiled on hot rocks, roasted 'taters, ash-cake and
sech. on sunday us had ash-cake cooked in collard leaves; an' beef was
served us when de killin' time come. marster always gived de niggers
plenty to eat.
"i can sit here an' picture dat house of marster's; a big, six-room
house wid wide plank weather-boarding. beside de house was a big garden,
and it had palings 'round it.
"my mammy was a fine weaver and did de work for both white an' colored.
dis is her spinning wheel, an' it can still be used. i use it sometimes
now. us made our own cloth an' our stockings, too.
lucindy lawrence jurdon, lee county, alabama
"no'm, us never did learn nothing. if us tried to read or write dey
would whack our forefingers off. us lived forty miles from de town an'
it would take more dan two days to git to town. de women folks had to
fix lunches every time dey went.
"my grandmammy had sixteen chilluns. i 'members dat when us courted us
went to walk an' hunted chestnuts. us would string dem an' put 'em
'round our necks an' smile at our fellers.
"on sattidy nights dey would have dances an' dance all night long.
somebody would clap hands, beat pans, blow quills or pick de banjer
strings. when us had cornshuckin's, dey would pile de corn up, ring
'round it an' shuck, drink likker an' holler: 'boss man, boss man,
please gimme my time; boss man, boss man, fer i'm most broke down.'
"i 'members dat one ol' sick man was freed 'fore freedom come. dey let
him go whar he wanted to, so he dug a hole in de ground an' used it fer
a room. he put rafters inside to help hold it up an' it slanted down at
de back."
lucindy mused a moment, concluded: "dem was good days, honey; mighty
good. but us shorely is in a bad fix now an' needs help mighty bad. it
jest ain't de same no more."
lucy kimball
interview with lucy kimball
—francois ludgere diard, mobile, alabama
i made two visits to the home of mammy lucy kimball. the first was
during the month of april, ; the next was nearly a month later. on
the first trip i had a very successful talk with the old negro woman,
but on the last, she wasn't at home, and so the information i sought had
to wait. i was very disappointed that i couldn't see her on my second
venture, but it was impossible.
mammy lucy had not grown very feeble when i last saw her, and her
methodical mode of living can be attributed to her consciousness of the
venerable age of eighty-five years which she had reached. she was born
into slavery in  at swift's landing near the town of blakeley, in
baldwin county. she was a slave in the charles hall family of that
county before and during the war between the states. in , she came
to work for the t.s. fry and santos rubira families of mobile.
following the war between the states, mammy lucy kimball worked in
various families at the summer resorts of baldwin county.
when a young girl, mammy lucy performed the duties of a children's
nurse, and worked as a dining room servant. she had some education, and
as she had worked in families of refinement and culture all her life,
her manner was that of a well educated person. however, like the average
educated negro, she still displayed the characteristics of the negro of
the ante-bellum days. she said that she strictly adhered to old
fashioned methods, such as: going to church twice a week, not believing
in doctors, and always taking home-concocted remedies.
i asked her if she believed in carrying a rabbit's foot for luck, to
which she responded:
"honey, you don' think i'm like these other negroes, who still believe
in that old nonsense? i might tell the children that a rabbit foot
brings good luck because it is an old custom for superstitions persons
to carry one, but, honey, you'd have just as good luck if you carried
brick-bats in your coat. my white people in baldwin county never brought
me up to believe in such things."
"well, mammy lucy," i asked, "do you remember any strange or weird
things that happened during the civil war?"
"yes," she answered slowly, "i remember during the civil war some of the
mischievous sibley boys who were kin to the hall family over in baldwin
county, tied a strange long black thread to the ankle of a black boy
named slow poke.
"some negroes were going to town that night to fetch supplies and among
them was slow poke. the boys jokingly asked him if he had his rabbit
foot with him as he might need it to keep the rattling noises away at
night. slow poke showed them his rabbit foot and, displaying his
glistening teeth in a broad grin he said that there 'warn't goin' to be
no ghosties atter him.' the boys deftly tied a string to slow poke's
ankle while some of their friends held his attention. on this string
were attached three cow bladders. slow poke hadn't gone far when he
heard the bladders rattling at his heels. he immediately decided that
there was a whole troop of ghosts after him, and so began to hit his
fastest gait down the middle of the dark road. he ran till he reached
montgomery hill some miles distant, where the string finally wore out.
his people didn't find him till three days later. then they took him
home and gave him a sound whipping for running away."
mammy lucy talked of the hall and sibley families and of the wealth that
they once had, and what happiness she found in being slave to such good
people. she remembered all the summer resorts on the eastern shore of
mobile bay when they were in their glory before the civil war, and how
the mobile ferries landed bringing over all the fashionable mobile
families to their summer homes on the bay. she remembered hearing father
ryan, the poet-priest of the south, preaching at the dedication of the
catholic church at montrose and the storm in the ''s which almost
demolished alabama city (now fairhope). she recalls the landing of the
confederate troops at hollywood for wood when they left mobile at the
outbreak of the war on their way to fort pickens, florida, to enter
active service.
i found mammy lucy to be neat and prim as she must have been thirty
years ago, when she first went to work for the fry and rubira families.
she still walks with the agility of a young person, and her mind is
fertile with fresh thoughts and with the deeds of the past. "i have
found happiness," she said. "people have been good to me and i, in
return, have tried to be kind to those around me. i have lived a plain
life and have been rewarded with a ripe age that still finds me feeling
young. i shall never grow old in my thoughts and actions, but always
keep a place in my mind to welcome something new. i will have had a
complete life if i can live only two weeks longer. there is something
i'd like to see."
after a few more minutes i left her and returned home. there was
something i wanted to ask mammy lucy; something that preyed on my mind
for days. i wanted to ask her what the thing was that she wanted to see.
she was so gentle and courteous; my interest seemed officious prying
into her affairs. someday i shall go to see her again, i decided, and
bring up the subject casually. then she'll never know of my unworthy
curiosity.
three weeks later i walked to the door of mammy lucy's cabin and on the
porch stood a negro girl watering a few pots of flowers.
"is mammy lucy at home?" i asked.
the girl was silent for a moment, then she spoke in a high-pitched
whining voice: "mammy lucy, she died."
"oh, i'm sorry," i said. "when did she die?"
"fo' days ago," was the reply.
i walked down the path of pebbles toward the bay. the question would
never be answered, but i knew that mammy lucy died content.
ellen king
personal conversation with aunt ellen king
mauvilla, alabama
—mary a. poole, mobile, alabama
ellen king lives in a two room cabin nestling back in the woods near
mauvilla, ala., about twelve miles above mobile. a little negro boy led
me along a circuitous path to the ex-slave, showing the weight of her 
years. after talking awhile she became interested and told that she was
born at enterprise, miss. on the plantation of mr. and mrs. harvey, but
could not recall their given names, or the names of their children, of
which there were three, two girls and one boy.
they lived in a big white house and the cabins in the slave quarters
were built of planks, with streets between and little gardens in front
of them. some planted vegetables and others flowers.
the harveys were good masters, they had plenty to eat, and good homespun
clothes to wear and home-tanned leather shoes. the women gathered
leaves, bark, and indigo to dye the cloth to make their dresses of
different colors.
the plantation was large and had several slaves. aunt ellen, however,
could not recall the number of acres or the number of slaves, but knew
there was a crowd of them. the harvey's raised wheat, cotton and corn,
and lots of live stock.
aunt ellen sat quiet for a few moments and said:
"lady, when i sits and thinks of all the good things us had to eat and
all the fun we had 'course we had to work, but you knows lady, when a
crowd all works together and sings and laughs, first thing you knows
work's done."
aunt ellen recalled the yankees coming through and telling all the
slaves they were free, and that a lot of the slaves went with them, but
aunt ellen laughed and said:
"my pa and some of the others got scared and hid in a big cave and just
stayed there until the soldiers left, and, lady, he still stayed on
atter the war with the harveys, and i was married there in the white
folks church. they gave me a big wedding, lots to eat, plenty of music,
singing and dancing. jest like they used to say, we 'danced all night to
broad daylight.'"
aunt ellen was asked how many times she was married and she
replied:
"twice, first one dead and don't know where t'other is, and had no
children by either."
when asked about religion aunt ellen said:
"lady, i prayed and prayed and religion came to me, and i jined the big
zion methodist church, in mobile, ala., but moved here to mauvilla where
there was no methodist church, so i jined the baptist church."
aunt ellen says the people of today are going back not forward. "all
they study is idleness and to do devilment these days. young generation
done gone, satan got 'am, too much 'juking' these days, have no time to
study 'bout the lord and their dying day. all they do, is juke, juke,
juke! when they closed the schools up here in mauvilla, they had
children all juking.
the writer was somewhat at a loss to know just what aunt ellen meant by
"juking," but thought best to let her talk on and not make a direct
inquiry, and after a little aunt ellen continued:
"no, lady, we used to call figgers for our dancing, had a big fiddle and
two small fiddles, and a set in one room and one in t'other. none of
this twisting and turning. i just can't stand all that juking, just
won't look at it."
by "juking" aunt ellen meant rough dancing of the generation of today.
aunt ellen firmly believes the old-time religion was best for all, and
tried to sing in a wavering voice the following:
"down by the river side,
jesus will talk and walk,
ain't going to study the world no more,
ain't going to study the world no more,
for down by the river side,
jesus will talk and walk."
mandy leslie
interview with mandy leslie
—daphne l.e. curtis, fairhope, alabama
in the suburbs of fairhope, in a rough but neatly-kept cottage of two
rooms, lives mandy leslie, a hard-working negro woman whose energy
belies the seventy-seven years to which she credibly lays claim. twice
widowed and her children scattered to the winds, mandy is a pillar of
strength and comfort to several white households, where she makes weekly
calls to care for the laundry work, "wash and iron," as she calls it.
the washing is done in the back yards, where a hot fire under an iron
pot boils the garments to a state that permits mandy's rubbing over a
fluted wash-board to make them spotless. strung on lines in the sun, the
clothes are ready for ironing next day.
using old-fashioned sadirons, heated at an open fire, mandy turns out a
"done-up" product that any modern laundry might envy. during the ironing
process, which takes place in the hall or a spare room, the mistress of
the house is entertained with a steady stream of biography, comment, and
information from the lonely old woman who relishes this opportunity to
talk to somebody, especially if there happens to be a visitor who is not
familiar with her story. a typical episode runs like this:
"yassum, i 'members de war, but i don't lak no wars. dey give folks
trouble and dey's full of evil doings. when de yankees come t'rough
here, dey took my mammy off in a wagon, and lef' me right side de road,
and when she try to git out de wagon to fetch me, dey hit her on de head
and she fell back in de wagon and didn't holler no more. dey jes' driv'
off up de big road wid mammy lying down in de wagon—she mount a been
dead, 'cause i ain't never seed her no mo'.
"unker john leslie and aunt josie and all dey chillun come along in a
wagon, gwine up north, dey said, and dey said dey found me standing dar
side de road crying for my mammy. aunt josie, she say: 'pore little
lamb, you gwine wid us. us ain't got much, but us can't let you die.'
and unker john, he say: 'poor chile, us mustn't leave her disaway.' he
lift me up in de wagon and drive twell de mule gin plum' out, and den us
stop and took up on a place not fur from mon'gomery, on mr. willis
biles' place. us live dar twell i was grown woman, and mr. biles sho'
was a good man to live wid and he treat us right every year.
"den i married taylor and us kep' on living wid mr. biles and all t'ree
of us's chillun was borned dere. den taylor died wid de fever, and he
had insho'ance whet us pay a dollar a mont' for de longest and he say it
take care me and de chillun when he gone. bless god, dat money didn't
take care nobody 'cept de doctor and de burying-man. dey bofe got dey
part and lef' me jes' two dollar and seventy cents, dat's all. mr. biles
say dey ought to be whupped for chargin' me lak dey did. den he went to
see 'em, and cussed 'em out, and dey sont back twenty dollar. i ain't
waste no more money on insho'ance, no ma'am!
"i had a hard time keeping my chillun and working de crop too; but mr.
biles, he 'low me a mule, jes' lak he do taylor 'fore he died, and us
made four bags of cotton de fust year and five bags de nex' year. i pick
every lock of it myself—jes' me and dem little chilluns.
"den rufus he come along and he thought us had all de insho'ance money,
and he court me so hard and so reg'lar dat i act a fool and married him,
and he turn out to be de no-countest nigger dat ever lived. 'stead of
him supporting me, us had to support him for nigh 'bout ten year, me and
de chillun. he had misery in he back, and couldn't do no hard work lak
plowing and hoeing. it hurt he back to pick cotton and pull fodder, and
he jes' set 'roun' and make a few baskets and eat lak a hoss.
"mr. willis biles he died, and he boy, mr. joe, he took de place and
run it for he ma. mr. joe told rufus 'twan't nothing de matter wid him
but damn lazy, and if he don't git out and he'p me work, he gonna set de
ku klux on him. den us got scared and moved nigh 'bout to uniontown, and
us live wid mr. bob simmons for seben years hand-running, and he treat
us right every fall 'bout de settlement. mr. bob he say 'tain't nothing
de matter wid rufus jes' lak mr. joe say, and rufus say he gwine move to
town whar he kin git work to suit him.
"us move to town, and rufus he gone all day looking for a job and don't
find nothing to suit him. i has to take in washing from de white folks
to feed us and dey charge two dollars rent for de little shack us live
in. 'twan't right to do dat; 'cause i ain't never paid no house-rent in
all my bo'n days, twell den. and de fust t'ing i know, dat trifling
rufus he done sell de mule and wagon and got drunk and lost de res' of
de money. us was sho' in a bad fix. why didn't i quit rufus? yassum, i
'spects i ought to done dat; but he' so humble when he sober up and pray
so strong. he say de lord done call him outen he meanness and he gwine
preach jesus. he make lak he need dem preacher clothes, and us skimped
along and saved 'nough to buy rufus de suit of clothes wid a long-tail
coat. he got a high-up hat and a bible, and he sho did look gran'. us
was proud to see him all fix up and going out to labor in de vineyard of
de lord.
"us give rufus de las' t'ree dollars us could scrape up and he got on de
train and went to mon'gomery, but us ain't seen hair nor hide of dat
nigger sence. in 'bout a year us got a letter from him in juliet, wayup
in illinois, wharever dat is, and he say he in de pen'tenshry for ten
year, 'cause dey 'scuse him stealing a woman's jew'lry, and would i get
mr. biles and mr. simmons to do what dey can to get him out. he repent
and been washed in de blood of de lamb sence he been in jail. and he say
if anybody write me dat he runned off from mon'gomery wid 'nother woman
and dat he got a wife in chicago, it's a lie.
"dat fix me wid dat triflin' nigger, and mr. sam broady, what's a
lawyer, he got me a 'vorcement and gin me back my fust name, leslie. now
i's t'rough wid marrying. my chillun done all gone and got married, and

"how de way wais' ironed suit you, missy?"
dellie lewis
interview with dellie lewis

"to begin at de beginnin', white folks," said dellie lewis, "i was bawn
on de plantation of winston hunter at sunflower in washington county,
alabama. it's on de southern railroad. de fus' thing dat i remembers was

lightnin'
interview with lightnin'
—john proctor mills
ignorant of the date of his birth, which occurred at cahaba, the old
state capital, lightnin' was an overgrown, gangling youth of fourteen or
thereabouts when the civil war began. born into slavery, he was the
property of one joel matthews, cotton planter, whose fields lay near the
then new capital city.
lightnin' is happiest when spinning some yarn of the old days in alabama
for an interested audience, and when one such inquired as to how he came
to be called "lightnin'," the old man broke into a toothless grin and
launched at once into another of the stories dear to his heart.
"dat's massa joel's doin's, boss. i jist natcherly wa'nt neber any too
peart an fas' on my foots, an de fus' thing massa joel eber sot me to
fetch him was a cool drink o' water. de water done got wa'm 'fo' i brung
it to him, an stid'er scoldin, he jist bus' out laffin' an' say: "boy,
you is so slow i gwineter call you after the fas'est thing on earth.
frum now on yo' name is lightnin'." an i been lightnin' eber since.
co'se i knowed massa joel was throwin' off on me, lil' as i was, but it
looks lak i wa'nt bawn in no big hurry an i jist been movin' long
slow-like eber since.
"massa joel musta been bawn on a sunshiny day 'cause he sho' was bright
an' good natured. eber' nigger on de place love him lak he was sont from
heaben. mos' eber' day he come to de quarters wid de fambly doctor to
look atter de niggers, fer he say a well-fed, healthy nigger, next to a
mule, is de bes' propersition a man kin 'ves' his money in." an' us
slaves fared as good as anybody.
"naw suh! massa joel ain't neber hit me a lick in his life. he say a
well nigger whut doan' wuhk, sho' ain't got no eats an care comin' his
way, an ought'er be sont down de ribber.
"is i been mah'id? yas suh. i done had fo' wives, an raise 'leben
chillun. but 'taint lak in de ole days. chillun all gone, an de ole
nigger got no white folks, makes it mighty hahd to git along. 'bout all
de ole man kin do is fish an i does dat an gits a li'l somp'in to eat.
'fo young massa tom passed on—he was massa joel's boy—i ain't neber
wanted fer nothin'. i was massa tom's body guard. us hunted an fished
together, played wid de white chillun an sometimes i rid behin' him on
de hoss, or on de fore seat wid de ca'iage driver when de fambly went to
chu'ch.
"but dat's all in de pas', an de good lawd say no man kin bring back de
pas'. so i reckon, ef you all 'll 'scuse me, i better go fish my
trotline an git somp'in to make the de skillit smell."
billy abraham longslaughter
interview with billy abraham longslaughter
—f.l. diard, [hw: mobile?]
on a bright april afternoon, while strolling along the louisville and
nashville banana wharf and watching the crisp breezes from the gulf make
small waves lick at the pilings, i met an old negro man who was fishing
for croakers off the pier. he had, sitting beside him, a basket
containing wicker canes for making and repairing chairs. in the course
of our conversation, i asked him his age.
"i'se eighty year old, white folks," he replied.
"well," i said, "you must have been a slave back in the days
before the war."
"yassuh, boss. i were eight year old when gen'l grant freed de niggers."
he spoke the words in a clear, strong voice and with a slight rolling
motion of his gray bristly head.
"but general grant didn't free the slaves, uncle," i protested.
"oh, yassuh he did too, white folks," he said respectfully; fo' i was
right dere when de gen'l come into richmond and sot us free."
"what about abraham lincoln?" i asked.
"well, i guess he done a part of it, but he didn't do no fightin', kaze
he hadda 'tend to de business in de white house. he lef' de freein' part
to gen'l grant. i don' guess mr. abe lived long enough ter help us
niggers much. he went to de ford's circus and got hisse'f shot."
"what's your name?" i asked.
"billy abraham longslaughter. de niggers all calls me billy, but ole
massa longslaughter afore he died called me william."
"where were you born, uncle billy?"
"on ole massa longslaughter's plantation near richmond virginny."
"can you read and write?"
"dey neber teach me no readin' and writin' kaze i had to work in de
fields." his rusty hand rubbed across his woolly head, as my questions
continued with the regularity of a metronome; nevertheless, uncle billy
seemed always glad to answer them. i couldn't help but notice with what
ease he moved about. he had the agility of a man twenty years his
junior, though his face, being caverned with wrinkles, gave him the
appearance of great age.
"where is your home now, uncle billy?" i continued.
"most any place i goes, white folks. ma wife, she died 'bout forty year
ago in virginny, and i been a trabelin' eber since."
"what do you do for a living besides fish?" i asked.
"oh," he said, "i canes a few chairs," pointing to his basket of
chair-canes beside him on the stringer of the wharf. "you see, white
folks, when all dis repression came on an' dere war'n't no work fo' de
people tuh do, jes lak all de young scallawags i hops me a train and
goes on a trip."
"where do you go next, uncle billy?"
"well, i guess i mought run ober to new orleens if i can catch me a
freight train a goin' dat away."
"about your fixing chairs," i said. "have you ever repaired any for well
known people?"
"lor', white folks, i caned a chair oncet fo' president buchanan and he
used it ter sit on in de white house. i'se made many a chair fo' famous
people as i trabeled about. i guess i jus' keep on a goin' as long as
i'se able, and when i goes on dat last trip across de quiet riber, i'se
goin' ter make one for ole gabriel, so's he can res' hisself in between
times he blows on dat hawn."
louis
interview with "uncle" louis
—david holt, mobile
of course you know that we always called the older colored men "uncle"
and the older colored women "aunt." it was proper manners.
old "uncle" louis was the oldest slave on the plantation, "uncle" toby
having died. louis was a "guinea nigger." his ancestors had been brought
from the guinea coast of africa. he had the characteristic marks of his
tribe, being short, strong and very black, with heavy neck, thick lips,
flat nose and eyes like those of a hog. he had great knowledge of wild
plants, claimed to understand the language of birds and beasts. he
prided himself on his powers as a hunter and also claimed intimate
friendship with ghosts and spooks. being what was known as a "yard
servant," he had picked up much of the talk of his white masters and
spoke his own version of their language.
old louis was what was called a "runaway nigger." he would run away in
the latter part of the summer once in every two or three years and come
back in time to help dig sweet potatoes. i was out in the sweet potato
patch one morning when he returned. the doctor was there, also. when
louis walked up he simply said, "hello, louis; are you well?"
"yes sir, marster."
"well, take that basket and go to picking up potatoes." not a word was
said about his running away. after the hands had knocked off work and
louis was sitting in front of his cabin, i went to him for an
interview.
"uncle louis, what makes you run away? you don't get whipped or abused
in any way."
the old slave scratched his grizzled head, puffed at his clay pipe and
pondered the subject for some time before he replied:
"marse davie, i does cause de woods seems to call me. when
de fall insec's is singin' in de grass an' the 'simmons is gettin'
soft an' de leaves is beginnin' to turn, i jes natcherly has ter go.
de wild sloes, de red haws an' de crab apples is ripe. de walnuts
an de hickory nuts an de beach mast drappin' an de blue smoke comes
over de woods, an de woods birds an de yard birds goes souf wid de
cranes an ducks an wil' geese an de blackbirds an de crows goes in
droves—it seem lack all dat is jes callin' me."
"where do you go?" i asked.
"lorsy, marse davie, i never goes off de plantation. i always go to de
woods back o' de past'er. ole master knows whar i is an so does henry.
don't you know dat holler dat come down on de lef' han' side of de
branch—de fus holler you comes to, not more dan two hundred yards in de
woods?" i knew it well.
"don't you 'member a big green oak tree growin' on de right han' side of
de holler bout a hunder yard up de path?"
"well, sir, dat tree is my home. i done toted some poles an some sedge
gress up dar an made me a bed—but you can't see it from de groun'. when
i gets up dar i can see all 'roun'. i seen you an marse joe de las' time
you go fishin'. i lays dar all day and listen to de birds and critters
talkin'. a chicadee tole me you was comin' long befo' i seen you. den a
jay bird caught a sight of you an he tole me. can't nobody come along
widout de birds tellin' me. dey pays no min' to a horse or a dog but
when dey spies a man dey speaks. i done tame' a squi'l so he comes see
me ever'day.
"de birds and critters sho is good comp'ny. i done made frens wid up all
but de owl and de hawk. dey is jes natchally bad an de other critters
hates 'em. a ole red-breast' hawk come an lit in a daid pine tree. i
seen him so plain til i knowed what he was thinkin' about. he was jes
mad clean down in his craw and was cussin' ever'thin'. a little pewee
bird seen him an begin to fuss. a crow fly over and hear de pewee, den
fly down close an take a good look at mister hawk den he fly up and
start callin' de other crows. in a little while a whole drove of crows
is flyin' 'roun dat pine tree. den de jay birds come an dey is callin'
for a fight, but de ole hawk never move. den de mocking birds come an
dey sair right in and starts pecking at de hawk until he dove into de
woods and gets away, an all de birds begin to talkin' 'bout bugs an
things."
the old man was wound up for an interminable talk on his favorite theme,
the talk of critters, and to change the subject i asked: "uncle louis,
ain't you afraid of ghosts?"
"lor', chile, i ain't feared of no ghos' or spook, as i's seed lots of
both. all a ghos' do is jes show hise'f. you never hear of one doin'
nothin' to nobody. dey is sociable an wants to be near livin' people.
when folks gets scared it hurts de ha'nt's feelin's an dey goes
somewhere else. dey has all de feelin's dey had when dey was livin'. you
wouldn't stay by wid folks dat's fear'd of you an want to run away from
where you is.
"las' night, when i was up in my nes', an my fire had died out, all
'sept one little chunk, an de moon was shinin' like day, i lay down, i
did, an i take a li'l nap o' sleep. den i wakes up sudden an looks 'roun
ag'in. well, sir, de norf side of de hill was covered wid ghoses an
spooks; dey was layin' down, standin' up and leanin' agin trees, but
mos'ly dey was jes sittin' on de groun', all lookin' at me hard as dey
could, widout battin' an eye.
"de neares' one to me was a little white ooman. she war sittin' flat on
de groun', holdin' a baby in her lap. she look mighty pitiful an i say
'please missis, can i ho'p you an yo' baby? i'd be 'bleeged if you tell
me.' her lips move but i couldn't hear no sound. den i lay me down an
drap off to sleep agin. when i wakes up de ghosses is all dere an de
little white ooman look lak she want to say somethin', but can't, an i
say, 'i ain' nothin' but a poor runaway nigger, but my marster is a
mighty kin' man, he'll sholy he'p you; but she didn't say nothin' an i
goes back to sleep. de next time i wakes up de sun was risin' an i jes
lays dere an watches de ghosses an spooks get thin, an fade away like a
fog."
the old negro was sitting in the twilight, talking in a low, impressive
monotone, in a language we both understood but which i find difficulty
in transcribing after all these years that intervene. a screech owl was
"miseryflying" in the family grave yard back of the quarters, a fitting
abligato to the narrative. though creepy sensations crawled up my spine,
i still had my doubts.
"uncle louis, do you really believe you saw all that, and didn't dream
it while you were curled up in your nest?" i asked.
the old man seemed aggrieved at my doubts as he replied:
"it ain't no beleevin' about it. i knows what i knows an i sees what i
sees. de ghos' is what lives when de body is done wore out, but it don't
die."
"it's all imagination," i said, in defense of reason and nature, as i
understood these things.
"i wants to ax you what does de imaginin'. it's your ghos' that does the
imagin' so you can see other ghosses an spooks."
in recognition of louis' knowledge and powers of reasoning my brother
william wrote a diploma in latin and presented it to him. after that he
was called "doctor" louis.
i recall that it was about that time that i read a book on psychology
but later discovered that there were those on the plantation who had a
better working knowledge of the subject than was taught in the book.

tom mcalpin
interview with tom mcalpin
—john morgan smith
"mornin' boss," said uncle tom mcalpin, "how is you dis mornin'?" the
old former slave spoke cordially with a definite twinkle in his muddy
eyes though his age had passed the four score and ten mark. his mind was
alert; his memory vivid, and his faculties of speech quite unusual. tom
mcalpin was indeed a remarkable man. there was really a sincere note of
welcome in his voice as he came forward, placed a large piece of
cast-iron pipe against the steps of his house,  ave. d. so.,
birmingham, and looked up at me showing a mouth of straggly teeth in a
warm smile.
"yassuh," he continued in his high-pitched voice after our salutations,
"i'll be glad to serve you as bes' i kin wid my knowledge of de pas'
years. jus' you set down in dat chair," he pointed to what was left of
an ante-bellum wicker seat; "i'll set on dese steps an' us'll go over de
whole thing from de beginnin's.
"fus' thing i guess you wants to know is whar an' when i was born.
yassuh, an' who i b'long to. well, boss, i was born in martersville,
alabamy. dat's five miles southwest of talladega. i come into dis ole
worl' on a sunny day in june, eighteen fawty fo'. i belonged to dr.
augustus mcalpin, an' from dat day to dis, i is seed many things come
an' go, an' i is aimin' to see a lot mo' befo' i cross to de udder side.
"de docta jus' had a small plantation, 'bout  acres, i s'pose, an' he
didn't have but  slaves, 'caze dere warn't no need fo no mo'. he was
busy in town adoctorin' folks. he didn't have no time to do any real
farmin'.
"my job aroun' de place was to nuss de chilluns, white an' nigger. we
all played 'roun' together. sometimes we play coon an' rabbit, fox an'
houn' and snatch, but what was de mostes' fun was a-ridin' ole sut. sut
was a donkey an' us useta hitch him to a wagon, an' six of de chilluns
would ride in de wagon an' i'd ride on his back. sometimes us'd ride all
de way into talladega wid sut.
"nawsuh, i ain't neber got no whuppin' but one, an' it was a sho' 'nough
complete one, boss, wid all de trimmin's. it all happened when de massa
told me he better not cotch dem hogs in de corn, an' iffen he did, i was
agoin' to git a whuppin'. well, boss, dere was one ole hog dat i jus'
couldn't keep outten dere so i tuk a needle an' sewed up his eyes.
'course i was jus' a little black 'un an' didn't know whut i was adoin',
but i sho' sewed up dat hog's eyelids so's he couldn't see nothin'. dat
kep' him outten de corn all raght, but when de massa found it out he
gave me a lickin' dat i ain't forgot yit. boss, dat was de onlies'
lesson i ever needed in my life. it done de wuk.
"yassuh, dere was pattyrollers 'roun' our place, but dey never cotched
me, 'caze i was too swif' for 'em. boss, i could take holt of a hosses
tail an' run 'roun' de pasture an' keep up wid him. i was sho' fas' on
my feets.
"nawsuh, us wan't never given no money for nothin', but i learnt how to
make baskets an' i would take 'em in to talladega on sat'day evenings
an' sell 'em to de white folks for fifteen cents. den when i needed
somp'n lak 'bacca or a little piece of chocolate, i could go to de sto'
an' buy it. lots of slaves on yuther plantations warn't 'lowed to make
any money dough.
"nawsuh, i ain't never had no schoolin', 'ceptin' what i could git outen
de little white folks' books myself. us niggers useta tote dere books to
school for 'em an' on de way i would look in de book an' git a little
learnin'.
"when us niggers on de mcalpin place et, us et raght at de same table
dat de white folks et at. atter dey finished dere meal, us slaves would
sit down raght atter dem an' eat de same kinda food. yassuh.
tom mcalpin, birmingham, alabama
"sho' i 'members de war. i 'members when de war commence', jeff davis
called for volunteers; den a little later when de south needed mo' mens
to fight, jeff davis' officers would go th'ough de streets, an' grab up
de white mens an' put ropes 'roun' dere wrists lak dey was takin' 'em
off to jail. an' all de while dey was jus' takin' 'em off to de war. dey
made all de white mens go. it was called de 'scription. some niggers
went too. dem niggers fought raght side of dere masters. some went as
body guards an' some went as soldiers.
"yassuh, boss, i recalls de time dat de 'federate soldiers, bless dere
souls, hid dere few hosses in de basement of de old masonic institute in
talladega an' hid dere amunition in de hollow stone pillars. gen'l
wilson an' his raiders come th'ough dar, but dey never did fin' dem
'federate supplies. dem yankees jus' lak to scare eve'ybody roun' de
place to death. dey shot up de town an' dem blue coats tuk eve'ything we
had: cotton, sugar, flour, hams, preserves, clothes, corn; eve'ything,
boss, eve'ything. dey even burned up some houses.
"but boss, dere ain't never been nobody afightin' lak our 'federates
done, but dey ain't never had a chance. dere was jes' too many of dem
blue coats for us to lick. i seen our 'federates go off laughin' an'
gay; full of life an' health. dey was big an' strong, asingin' dixie an'
dey jus knowed dey was agoin' to win. an' boss, i seen 'em come back
skin an' bone, dere eyes all sad an' hollow, an dere clothes all ragged.
boss, dey was all lookin' sick. de sperrit dey lef' wid jus' been done
whupped outten dem, but it tuk dem yankees a long time to do it. our
'federates was de bes' fightin' men dat ever were. dere warn't nobody
lak our 'federates.
"i was in richmond dat cold day dat gen'l lee handed his sword over to
de yuther side, an' i seen jeff davis when he made a speech 'bout
startin' over. i seen de niggers leavin' dere homes an' awandering' off
into de worl' to god knows whar, asayin' good-bye to dere white folks,
an' atryin' to make dere way de bes' dey kin. but, white boss, it jes'
seem lak you let a nigger go widout a boss an' he jes' no good. dere
ain't much he kin do, 'caze dere ain't nobody to tell him. yassuh, i was
sont to richmond to bring home some of our wounded 'federates. dey sont
me 'caze dey knowed i was agoin' to do my bes', an' caze dey knowed i
warn't afeered of nothin'. dat's de way i've always tried to be, white
boss, lak my white people what raised me. god bless 'em."
anne maddox
interview with anne maddox
—preston klein, opelika
bible records place anne maddox's age at . she lives in a tiny cabin
with her youngest child, zora, about eight miles from opelika. she is
very feeble now and had to be wheeled out on the front porch to have her
picture made.
anne lives exclusively in the past. to her, the present world is "full
of de devil an' gettin' worser every day." she likes to talk about the
old days, but her voice is feeble and barely above a whisper.
"i'se heerd a heap o' talk 'bout mr. abraham lincoln," she said, "an' i
had a picture of him onc't; but i don't know nothin' 'bout him."
anne takes her religion seriously and is devoutly confident that she
will "inherit de promise."
"i jined de church in gold hill, alabama," she recalled, "an' honey, i
felt so good i don't know jest how i did feel. i shouted three days an'
wouldn't eat a bite. i couldn't even drink water."
the old former slave was born in virginia in  and belonged to john
umford. she was later sold to bill maddox, of alabama.
"when i come from virginny," she said, "us travelled in wagons and slept
in tents. eve'y mornin' us was made to clean ourselves an' dress up; den
us was put on de block an' bid on. white peoples was dere from
everywhere; de face of de earth was covered by dem. i was thirteen den,
an' i kin remember four wars.
"my mother and father was charlie an' rhody heath, an' i had two
brothers an' two sisters. our houses was lak horse stables; made of logs
wid mud an' sticks dobbed in de cracks. dey had no floors. dere warn't
no furniture 'cept a box fer de dresser wid a piece of looking glass to
look in. us had to sleep on shuck mattresses an' us cooked on big
fireplaces wid long hooks out over de fire to hang pots on to bile.
anne maddox, opelika, alabama
"us fried on three-legged skillets over de fire an' cooked ash-cakes on
de hearth wid hickory leaves on de bottom nex' to de hearth. 'tain't no
sech good cookin' now as den.
"'bout four o'clock in de evenin' all de little niggers was called up in
de big yard where de cook had put milk in a long wooden trough an'
crumbled ash-cake in it. us had pot licker in de trough, too. us et de
bread an' milk wid shells an' would use our hands, but it was good.
"ol' marster hunted a heap, but us never did git none of what he brought
in. us had plenty of clothes, sich as was, but dey was spun an' wove at
home. us had home-made shoes, hard brogans, called 'jackson ties.' dey
had brass caps on de toe an' would rub blisters on de feet.
"de plantation had several hundred acres. i was up wid de fust light to
draw water and help as house girl. when dat task was done i had to go to
de fiel'. dey blew a big hawn to 'rouse de slaves in de morning's,
sometimes 'fore day.
"marster was good to us niggers, dough. he never 'lowed us to
be whupped; jist scolded us. if us went anywheres, us had to be back
by sundown. i once seed some slaves workin' roads in chains wid a
iron ball hangin' on behin'. it was punishment fur meanness."
anne said the slaves on the maddox plantation were never allowed to
learn to read and write, declaring: "it was too bad if dey kotched a
nigger wid a pencil an' paper in his han!"
"i was made to carry marster's chilluns to school, den go back fur 'em,"
she said. "ol' mistus read us de bible, an' us went to de white folks
church an' sat in de back, wid de white peoples sittin' up front.
"oh, dem patterollers was bad. i sho' would run from dem things, too."
anne's mind leaps in fast succession from one subject to another, and at
times it is difficult to keep up with her intermingled thoughts.
"ol' marster give us plenty of licker," she said, "an' us laked dat. one
of de funniest things us had aroun' de plantation was a little goat dat

plowed ever' day us could. us cooked on dem great big fireplaces, 'bout
six feet wide an' two an' three feet deep, with pots an' kittles hangin'
out over hickory an' oak fires. nobody better not spit in dat fireplace
neither. sho' never was better eatin' collards dan dem. all the chillun
had a tin plate an' a tin cup with buttermilk in hit.
"i was whut dey called a shirt-tail fellow, had long shirt dresses of
osnaburg dyed with red mud an' cinnamon bark. in winter dey doubled de
osnaburg to be warmer. my daddy was a shoemaker. he made dem outer
cowhides an' even lef' de hair on dem sometimes. yuther times he clean

"us had good marsa and mistiss, iffen you wukked an' 'haved yourse'f.
dey was marsa willis an' miss hanna menefee. dey jes' had two chillun
willis an' willie. willie weighed two hundred pounds when he was very

raght by it.
"mr. sadler, de overseer, was good, too, but you sho' had to wuk. he's
got a great-great-grandson, sam sadler, living now in waverly, alabama.
de poor white peoples 'roun' dere used to ho'p us wuk. i disremembers
our carriage driver's name but us had one dat drove mistiss about, an'
de carriage house was close to de big house.
"marsa had seven or eight hundred acres in de plantation an' i jes'

an' 'fo'. blowed a cockle shell to get us niggers up. iffen you didn't
wuk, dey 'tended to you. dey slashed one nigger an' he died nex' week.
us plowed 'twell dark an' lots an' lots of times all night long wid a
lantern tied to front an' back of de plows. we was picking cotton all
night long too, be ready to take dat wagon to de gin by three or four
o'clock in de morning. sometimes dey would put de slaves in chains. when
dey wuk clearing up new groun' dey had chains put 'roun' dey ankles.
frank menefee, opelika, alabama
"on sunday mornin' mistiss would try to teach us niggers de bible. den
us would go to church at white church an' sit in de back wid white folks
in front. de preacher was rev'ren frank hugely. dat sunday mornin'
breakfast sho' was good to us niggers. us had meat, sugar, lard an'
butter. i used to love to hear dem sing. when my soul be resting in de
presence of my lord, i'll be satisfied. i was baptized at eleven o'clock
by dave hill an' i sho' got happy. i shouted an' sung: 'i'se never drunk
no whiskey in my life.' when any of de niggers would pass on, old
mistiss would stand over de casket and weep. us would pull off our hats
an' marsa was nice as he could be, too. hit was a home-made box dyed
black. mistiss she would see to de fixin' of de shroud.
"de patrollers sho' would get you an' dat's one thing made you stick to
your wuk.
"on sadday nights us would frolic an' dance all night long iffen you
wanted to, buck-dance, sixteen-hand reel and cake walk. dey would blow
reed quills an' have all the licker dey wanted. mistiss, dey ain't jes'
now drinkin' licker. oh, dem cornshuckings! shuk corn, drink an' holler
all night long. sometimes dey'd sing:
dark cloud arising like gwine to rain,
nothing but a black gal coming down the lane,
nigger stole a pumkin an' started outer town;
nigger heered it thunder, lord, an' throwed dat pumkin down.
"mistiss, i don't wanter tell you no mo' of dat.
"when us niggers ma'ied, dey didn't have no preacher. we jes' jumped
over de broom, an' went on an' lived together. iffen a gal went wrong,
dey beat her nearly to death. iffen you moved de place when you ma'ied,
de other marsa had to buy you.
"de li'l niggers had big times. us used to play, 'green grow the willow
tree, you swing my gal an' i swing yourn. green grow de willow tree.'
dey used to sceer up us niggers 'bout "raw head an' bloody bones," gwine
to ketch us dat was so sceer bad iffen us didn't mind 'em, but i ain't
never seed nor believed in ghostes. us didn't get sick much 'caze us
didn't have no trash to eat an' mistiss giv' us ebony of yarbs an' us
wore sacks of yarbs 'roun' our necks too.
"the yankees did plenty of harm. marsa shot at some of dem; an' dey took
off our cabin wagons. when us was freed dey singed, 'i'se gwine back to
dixie, no more my heart to wander, never see my master no mo'.'
"marsa called us all up an' told us we was jes' free as him. he give us
all a suit of clo'es, some money, a mule, a cow, wagon, hog and a li'l
corn to start off on. us moved to dr. lawrence smiths near la-fayette,
alabama.
"later years i ma'ied jane drake at the cafe in opelika, alabama, and by
de jedge at twelve o'clock. she died, den i ma'ied phoebe ethen drake.
some says de church can't save you, but i sho' feels safer in hit, an' i
jined 'caze i wants to be better dan i was an' try to be
saved."
isaam morgan
interview with isaam morgan
—mary a. poole, mobile, alabama
"mistis, i was bawn in , 'cordin' to ole miss's bible, near lotts
landing on the alabama river." it was isaam morgan who spoke from his
porch at  sligo street, mobile, alabama. "i made a special trip back
dar a few months back to de ole place, an' mistis' daughter looked it up
for me 'caze i done had forgot.
"mr. james morgan was my massa, an' his wife, miss delia, was my mistis.
my mammy's name was ann morgan, an' as for my pappy, i done forgot
his'n. i was raised raght dar in de white folks house, an' i had my own
special place to sleep. i was de house boy, an' when i growed older i
driv' mistis aroun' in de ca'iage.
"us niggers lived in sho-'nuff style. us had our regular quarters whar
us lived in white log cabins chinked wid mud, an' de slaves had built-in
beds an' a big open fireplace whar dey cooked. us had plenty somp'n
t'eat. all us had to do was to ask for it an' de massa done de res'. our
rations was gib out to us eve'y sadday. some of de bes' food us ever had
was 'possum an' taters. us'd go out at night wid a big sack, an' a pack
of houn's an' twarn't long befo' we done treed a 'possum. atter we done
treed him, de dogs would stan' aroun' de tree an' bark. iffen de tree
was small, us could shake him out. iffen it was big, one of de niggers
hadda climb up it an' git ole mr. 'possum hisself.
"funny things about 'possums, miss; de bigger dey is seem lak de littler
de tree dey picks to go up. it is sho-'nuff fun, dough, to go a trailin'
th'ough de woods atter a 'possum or coon. de coon'll give you de bes'
chase, but he ain't no good eatin' lak de 'possum. i seen a coon one
time when he was cornered bite de tip of a houn's nose off.
"massa morgan sol' wood to de steam boats, an' us slaves hadda cut de
wood, an' split it up into smaller pieces. any time a slave worked over
time or cut mo' wood dan he s'pose' to, massa pay him money for it, caze
whenever one of us slaves seen somp'n we lak, we did jus' lak de white
folks does now. us bought it.
"massa never whupped none of his slaves; he jus' tole us whut to do an'
iffen we didn't do it, he'd call us to him an' he would say in his sorta
way: 'nigger! how many mo' times is i gotta tell you to do lak you
tole?' dat's all he would say, an' believe me mistis, he hada a way of
lookin' at you dat made you jump. when he bought a new slave dat wasn't
use to doin' what he was tol', 'twarn't long befo' massa had him in
line.
"no'm none of our slaves ever tried to run away. dey all knowed dey was
well off. we didn't have no oberseer but once. he was a mean un too. he
tried to fight an' whup us slaves, an' one night six big nigger men
jumped on him an' scairt him mos' to death. atter dat de massa wouldn't
never have no mo' oberseers. he tended to dat business hisself.
"whut we do atter we finished work? go to bed! dat was de onl'es' place
we was fittin' for. us was so tired us wouldn't lie down two minutes 'fo
us was 'sleep. on some moonlight nights us was 'lowed to pick de cotton.
den us'd git a little res' de nex' day.
"massa an' his fambly used brass lamps an' candles for light, an' a few
of us slaves had brass lamps too, but most of de niggers used torch
lights.
"some of de plantations had a calaboose whar dey putt de slaves dat
wouldn't behave. dis calaboose was built of logs fastened together wid
stout ropes an' sunk into de groun', but massa didn't need no calaboose
to make his niggers behave.
isaam morgan, mobile, alabama
"yassum, us had remedies for ailments. we used wild hoarhound tea for de
chills an' fever, an' sweet gum turpentine, an' mutton suet. dey wan all
good uns too. but shucks! warn't nothin' much ever de matter wid us
niggers.
"yassum, we used rock an' cotton to start de fires on de plantation, an'
massa had a flint lock rifle, too.
"de slaves had dere own special graveyard an' us'd make de coffins raght
on de place dar. when someone die, he was taken in a ox cart to de
grave, wid all de slaves a-walkin' 'long behine de cart singin' de
spirituals.
"our clothes was made mostly outen osnaburg wove on de plantation. we
had wool clothes for de winter time dat was carded on de place. we had
shoes made by our own cobbler an' tanned on de plantation. we called
dese brogans.
"atter de surrender, de yankees camped near our place, an' bought aigs
f'um us. dey offered me a hoss iffen i would go nawth wid dem, but i
jus' couldn't leave de massa even dough i did wanted dat hoss mighty
bad. i was twenty-one years old when massa came to me one day an' say:
'isaam, you is a grown man now. you is got to boss your own business.
it's up to you to fin' work. i can't keep you no longer. good luck
isaam. you has been a good nigger, an' you is gonna make somebody a good
worker.'
"atter i lef' massa i worked at diff'ent jobs, sich as: loader,
roustabout on different steamboats an' cotton picker. i worked on de
may boyd, lula d. an' de gardner. one of de ole songs sang on de

"yes maam you can take my picture, but lemme git my hat, caze i ain't

fixed up stylish."
tony morgan
from record of a conversation in 
—francois l. diard, mobile, alabama
george washington extolling the virtues of a plain, homespun
suit—granite-jawed andrew jackson defying the british at
pensacola—horror and massacre at alabama's old fort mims—savages
skulking near the fort, their bronzed bodies glistening in the hot
august sunlight.
these were among memories of parchment-skinned uncle tony morgan, who
was interviewed on oct. ,  by jim thomas, another slave, and a
record of the conversation held in the files of a family in old mobile,
alabama. uncle tony was  years old then.
the story is told by thomas, former slave of the diard family. uncle
tony was the slave of mobile judge h. toulmin, grandfather of the later
judge h.t. toulmin, who was appointed a judge by president jefferson.
according to jim thomas, uncle tony told him:
"did i knowed gen'l andrew jackson? lord bless you honey, why, i knowed
him and remember gen'l george washington afore him."
uncle tony explained that he accompanied general jackson when the
war-loving tennessean marched from mobile against pensacola in . he
said he was serving as a wagoner, and remembered distinctly that the
british surrendered on november . he recalled that, during the battle,
jackson was standing talking with a group of officers when an enemy
shell exploded near him.
"move away, general," the old negro quoted one of the officers as
saying, "they'll kill you!"
and jackson replied in a characteristic manner:
"damn 'em—i'll have 'em all in hell tomorrow!"
concerning george washington, uncle tony told jim thomas that the great
american leader visited the town of frankfort, ky., and while there made
an address. he wore a home-spun suit, which he pointed out as an example
of what people might do in utilizing their products.
frankfort was highly excited when washington arrived in the city, and
uncle tony told of a tiny urchin exclaiming with bitter disappointment
in his voice:
"why, pa, he ain't nothing but a man!"
uncle tony's memory of what occurred at fort mims was vivid, according
to jim thomas. the older slave related that he was one of many negroes
in the fort at the time. he said the defenders had been sleeping off a
night of dissipation the morning william weatherford's warriors
attacked.
men, women and children were butchered in the ensuing slaughter and the
buildings were fired. the massacre continued until noon, uncle tony
said, when the indians retreated with scalps and several negro prisoners
to their camping site, called the holy ground. here, the half-starved
negroes lived in constant dread that they would be butchered by
war-inflamed creeks.
uncle tony also recalled carrying the mail from fort stoddert, in
alabama, through the state and mississippi. on several occasions he
barely escaped being scalped by indians, he said.
the old negro related further that his father was a wagoner under
cornwallis when that general surrendered to washington at yorktown.
concerning his age and birthplace, uncle tony told thomas he was born
in danville, ky., about . he went to mobile in  with judge
toulmin.
at the time of the interview the old slave was extremely feeble and
lame, and walked with the aid of a cane. his skin was dried and
wrinkled, and cataracts on his eyes had totally deprived him of his
sight. despite these handicaps, however, thomas said the old man's mind
was exceptionally clear, and his recollection of events occurring almost
a century before were remarkable.
mose
told by edith tatum, greenville, alabama
—mildred scott taylor, georgiana, alabama
the early spring sunshine sifted through the honey-suckle vines
clustering around the cabin door, and made a network of dancing light
upon the floor. a little negro boy sat on the steps gazing silently up
the dusty road and idly listening to the insistent buzzing of insects
hovering about the honey-suckle blooms.
"don't yer see nothin' of her yet, jerry?" came in a querulous voice
from a bed in a corner of the cabin.
"naw, unc' mose. she ain't in sight yit, but it's mos' time fer 'er."
"hit 'pear lak dis mis'ry is er gittin' wus all de time," the voice went
on.
"miss sally say dat limerumunt gwine he'p it," essayed jerry
consolingly.
"it don' do no good 'cep'in jess whilst aun' judy is er rubbin'. de
rubbin' does mo' good dan de limerumunt."
"dar she is, rat now!" exclaimed jerry presently.
"praise de lawd! fer de ole man sho is hongry en' got de mis'ry from his
haid to his heels."
"dar's ernudder lady wid miss sally. sarter looks lak er gal."
"mus' be some er ole master's gran'dahters come on er visit. whyn't yer
come an' sit some cheers out an' dus' em' an' straighten dis quilt
'stead er settin' dar lak er black patch on de sunshine? don' yer know
how ter ack when de quality is comin'?" by the time the chairs had been
arranged to his notion the visitors were at the door.
"good morning, uncle mose," said the older woman brightly, as she put a
covered basket down on a table by the bed.
she had a strong, sweet face and smooth white hair, and the gracious
dignity of a queen. "i hope you rested well last night and are feeling
very much better. i have brought some one to see you. now guess who she
is," and she placed the girl where the sunshine fell across her face.
uncle mose turned his head on the pillow, and gazed eagerly at his
visitor. then his old black face wrinkled into a smile. "lawd, honey,
you sho' mus' be one er mars' eddard's dahters, frum de favor!"
"you are right, uncle mose. it's miss caroline."
"i'm so sorry to find you in bed, uncle mose," said the girl, coming
closer, while miss sally began taking an appetizing breakfast from the
basket and putting it on the table.
"father told me not to come home without seeing uncle mose. he talks of
you so often."
the old man beamed with pleasure. "den mr. eddard's done fergive me for
not choosing him dat time," he said with a chuckle. "did you ebber h'yar
'bout dat time i choosed mah master?"
"now, uncle mose, none of your reminiscence until jerry has given you
your breakfast. then i know that caroline will be delighted to hear all
about it," and miss sally smiled indulgently. "here, caroline, put these
flowers in water where uncle mose can see them, while i measure some
medicine for him."
"dat sho was er good breakfus', miss sally," said the old negro with a
sigh of content, as jerry gave him the last bit of waffle. "ole aun'
jincy allers was er good cook, en her ma befo' 'er. couldn't nobody beat
aun' lucy cookin' in dem days. ginger cakes? she made de bes' ginger
cakes! miss sally, you 'member dat time ole marster give me an mars' wat
er whole silver dollar en we walked two miles to mars' walter's sto' en
spent ev'ry bit er it fer ginger cakes? er whole dollar's wuth er ginger
cakes, an' aunt lucy rat dar at home er cookin' de bes' ones in de
country! mars' wat sho was er sight!" and mose lay looking with dim eyes
into a happy, long-vanished past.
"now tell me about when you chose your master," said caroline, drawing a
chair closer to the bed.
"o, dat time; i 'members dat mornin' jess lak it was yistiddy. hit was
in the spring-time lak dis, en ole mose was er lil' black rascal lak
jerry dar. i was playin' roun' de cabin do' en h'yer come jim de ke'ge
driver, en say ole marster wanted me rat erway. i sho was skeered! but i
couldn't think o' no meanness i had done so i jess helt up mah haid en
marched up de road ter de big house. en dar i foun' ole marster standin'
on de steps, en in er row on de po'ch was mars' eddard, en mars' ted, an
mars' wat, en mars' tom. 'come h'yer mose,' say ole marster in dat big
way er his'n. 'come h'yer en choose yer marster. i'm gwine to give yer
ter de one you picks out.' i 'gan at mars' eddard. he was older 'en me
an' sorter se'rus lak so i passed him by. i looked at mars' ted er long
time sorter hes'tatin', but den i jess chanced ter look at mars' wat, en
dem blue eyes er his'n was fa'rly dancin' wid sump'n sorter lak ole
nick, en i say ter mahself, 'dat's de marster fer mose,' so i say out
loud, 'i chooses mars' wat,' en bress yer heart, honey, i ain' nebber
been sorry er minute sence. but de res' er ole marsters' boys nebber did
fergive mose fer dat," and he chuckled at the remembrance.
caroline laughed. "thank you, uncle mose, i've enjoyed hearing about it.
i must go and see mammy now. next time i come i hope you will be
better."
"de ole man ain' had his foots ter de flo' in five weeks dis comin'
sadd'y miss ca'line. good bye, miss ca'line honey, come ergin."
"and now, jerry, you run tell aunt judy to come up at once and rub uncle
mose's ankles," said 'miss' sally as caroline left the cabin. "i'll warm
this liniment and have it all ready." she stopped before the open
fireplace and raked up the embers into a little blazing fire, and
putting the saucer of turpentine on the floor at some distance, she
stood up and turned toward the bed. just then a spark from the fire fell
into the saucer, and the turpentine blazed up. 'miss' sally, startled,
sprang back, but in so doing, her light cotton morning gown came in
contact with the blazing turpentine and was quickly ignited. she caught
up her skirts and tried to put it out with her hands, but could not. for
several seconds 'miss' sally stood face to face with an awful death.
"my god-er-mighty!" cried uncle mose, and with the agility of youth and
health he sprang from the bed dragging a blanket with him, and throwing
it around her, wrapped it close, extinguishing the flames just as aunt
judy and jerry appeared in the door.
"de lawd in hebben!" cried fat judy, her swift glance taking in miss
sally's white face, burned garments and helpless hands, and 'uncle' mose
tottering back to his bed.
"po' lamb! now jess look at dem han's! lemme tie 'em up in wet sody this
minute! you sho 'mos' got burned up, honey."
"i would have, but for uncle mose," said 'miss' sally faintly, as she
sank into a chair.
aunt judy turned stormy eyes upon the poor groaning old man. "i'd lak
ter know how cum unc' mose jess foun' out he kin walk?" she inquired
belligerently. "i 'lowed some time ergo dat mose was possumin'. i sho
ain' gwine to waste mo' elbo' grease on dat old hyp'crite."
"hush, judy," said her mistress sternly, "uncle mose is no hypocrite. he
has inflammatory rheumatism. it was a miracle," she added reverently.
"dat's hit!" exclaimed mose, eagerly. "er miracle! hit was de
lawd-er-mighty let mose git up den. fer how you reckon i'd eber face
mars' wat ergin' ef i had to tell him i jess lay in de baid en let my
lil' mistress burn up? mose done promus mars' wat ter tek keer er miss
sally, an' ole man done de bes' he could."

when i was looking for sally murphy, i went into a clean, four room
cabin and found a small, neat negro woman.
"are you sally murphy?" i asked.

"i was jes' 'bout ten years come slavery done. i was borned down on de

pot wid meat. dey made good greens and us had poke salad, too. (made
from the leaves of the pokeberry).
"when dey dried de fruit us would cook our kind of fruit cake. i don't
recollect what went in it. dere was plenty though. mistis had de fruit
dried on tins in de yard, and at twelve o'clock every day all hands went
to de house and turned de fruit.
"our beds was homemade, scaffold bedsteads wid ropes wove acrost de top
what could tighten up. sometimes us had homewove bedspreads on de beds
most every day, but in gen'ally dat was for sunday only.
"our menfolks used to hunt possums and wild turkeys, but dey didn't mess
'roun' none wid rabbits. they didn't waste time on fishing either.
"ev'y morning in may mistis would call us little niggers to de house
and ev'y other morning give us oil and turpentine. we made our own cloth

"us mostly stayed at home and didn't go 'bout none, and effen us went to
mt. jefferson church us had to have a pass or de paterollers would sho'
git you. i did think dat 'hark from the tomb in doleful sound, how
careful, how careful den ought i to live, wid what religious fear' was
de prettiest thing, and i sho' did love to hear dem sing hit. i never
seed de baptising, 'ca'se i used to go to de 'piscopal church wid mistis
and open gates and hold de hosses. i sot in de foot of her carriage.
"christmas dey'd give us provisions and de chillun some trash (meaning
toys). dey sho' had good times on moonlight nights at de cornshuckings.
dey would haul de corn from de fields and put it in a big ring, and as
dey shucked dey would throw it in ring and den into de crib. sometimes
dey was so much corn it would stay on de ground 'twell it rotted.
"mr. dickey williams' mother, miss emily, ma'ied while us was dere and
my grandma cooked de cake. my daddy made de cake stand. hit had three
tiers, each one full of little cakes wid de big cake on top. hit sho'

opelika in de ole plank court house. i didn't have no chillun and i
lives now wid my niece, sally thomas.
"i don't know what i think 'bout abraham lincoln. i don't know nothing
'bout him. slavery was all right in its place, i guess, 'ca'se some
needed it to make 'em work.
"folks get so sinful i thought i was safest in de church. i believe god
intended for us all to be religious."
hattie anne nettles
interview with hattie anne nettles
—preston klein, opelika, alabama
"dey was sad times, honey; all de people was goin' to war wid de drums
beatin' all aroun' and de fifes blowin.'"
hattie anne nettles looks younger than her eighty years, but she
remembers climbing a fence to watch gray-clad soldiers of the
confederacy marching toward the front. she also remembers a few details
about slavery, although she was only a child at the time.
hattie was born in tallapoosa, ga. her father and mother were archie and
matilda benson. she had eight brothers and sisters; charlie, george,
abraham, mose, lucinda, mandy, margaret and queenie.
"us had corded beds in dem times," she said, "an' dey was screwed in de
corners to tighten 'em. our cookin' was simple, too. us used a griddle
hoe to cook on de big fireplaces.
"our dresses was homespun cloth dyed wid indigo, an' us didn't have very
many clothes. but us kept plenty warm in de winter; an' in de hot
summers us didn't need mor'n a thin li'l ol' dress."
hattie called her master "a good christian-hearted man who did de bes'
he could for de niggers."
"i 'members," she said, "dat all de chilluns was good, too, 'ceptin' two
of de boys. dey was bad uns for sho' an' was arguin' an' fightin' all de
time.
"honey, ol' marster sho'ly did lak to sing, an' he was pretty good at
dat. i 'members dat he useter git out in de back an' sing to de top of
his voice: 'i'se gwine home to die no more.'
"what i 'members most, dough, was de quiltin's an' spinnin' frolics dat
de women-folks had. den, on sattidy nights, dere was sattidy night
suppers an' dances. all de peoples sho'ly did cut de high step at de
dances."
hattie beamed as the trend of conversation turned to christmas on
southern plantations.
hattie anne nettles, opelika, alabama
"dat was a time!" she exclaimed. "us had to go to mornin' prayer, but
atter dat us went back to de cabins, dressed in our sunday bes', an'
went up to de 'big house' fer some foolishness. an' it was sho'ly real
foolishness, too.
"when i was growed up i married bill lockhart an' us had fifteen
chilluns an' eight gran'chilluns. in de ol' days niggers axed de white
marster for de bride an' no license was needed. iffen dey lef' de
plantation, de other white marster bought 'em so de girl could go wid
her man.
"our ol' marster was as good as he could be like i done tol' you. he
looked atter de slaves when dey got sick an' sont for de doctor. in dem
days dey would draw blood. dey would draw almos' a quart from de body,
an' you usually got well, too."
hattie recalled one night of terror on the plantation when the ku klux
klan raided a prayer meeting where a large number of negroes had
congregated.
"de klansmen beat up lots of dem," she said. "if a nigger didn't behave,
dey'd nigh 'bout kill him."
hattie lives in opelika with a daughter. flowers dot her clean yard and
her old days are full of happiness.
w.e. northcross
autobiography of reverend w.e. northcross, 
—levi d. shelby, jr. (colored), tuscumbia, alabama
(chapter —how reared)
i was born a slave in , in colbert county, alabama. education was
denied me, hence i grew up in ignorance. my mother and father were
carried from me when i was only nine years old, but as soon as chance
presented itself i ran away and went to them. my white people brought me
back, and as they were not cruel to their slaves they did not "buck" me.
i stayed with them until i was fifteen summers old. during this time my
mistress made all the children, both girls and boys, come to her every
sunday, and she taught sunday school. the book used was the old
fashioned catechism.
jesus keep me near the cross,
there's a precious fountain,
free to all, a healing stream,
flows from calvary's mountain.
it was against the law for them to learn to read and write, so she
taught them the lord's prayer and a few other things in the book. she
said that she wanted them to know how to pray, how to tell the truth and
not to steal, and always try to do right in the sight of everybody and
in the sight of god. with these influences, i confessed a hope in christ
at the age of thirteen years.
am i a soldier of the cross,
a follower of the lamb,
and shall i fear to own his cause,
or blush to speak his name?
when she did not teach herself, she had an adopted girl to do the same.
finally the adopted girl married and moved to the farm where i was born,
the farm from which i ran away. about this time, i was twenty years old.
i felt that there was something for me to do. i began to lead prayer
meetings. still i felt that there was more for me to do.
(chapter —entering the ministry)
i felt sure that i was called to preach, though "unlearned and
ignorant." i trembled at the thought of preaching the gospel, but
something seemed to push me forward in that direction. so i asked the
people to let me preach. this request was granted. the people at that
time had no place or house of worship. i began to fast and pray night
and day. being "unlearned and ignorant" (acts :) my heart silently
murmured—
bread of heaven, bread of heaven,
feed me till i want no more.
this was the only school i attended, both day and night. at this time i
did not know "a" from "b," but i met a man who could read a little. this
man liked me and promised to teach me how to read, provided i would keep
it a secret. this i gladly promised to do.
i am weak, thou art mighty,
hold me with thy powerful hand.
i secured a blue-back speller and went out on the mountain every sunday
to meet this gentleman, to be taught. i would stay on the mountain all
day sunday without food. i continued this way for a year and succeeded
well. i hired my own time and with my blue-back speller went to the
mountain to have this man teach me. the mountain was the great school
which i attended. i went from there to the blacksmith shop to work. from
that place i was captured by the yankees and carried to war. as i was
crippled i was allowed to remain in the commissary department for about
six months. while we were at camp at athens, alabama general forest came
upon us and defeated, captured, and killed until they were almost
literally wiped out of existence. i had been kind to some little white
children, by which i had won their love, and of course, the love of
their parents, and stayed with them three days during the battle. i came
to a river and turned aside to a farm from which all the people had gone
to save themselves from the war, i got a man to help reach an island
where i worked three days without anything to eat except grapes and
muscadines. i preferred to die on the island than to be killed by the
soldiers. therefore, in time of danger, i rushed to this house and the
good people hid me and changed my clothes. hence, when i was found i was
taken for one of the gentleman's slaves. when i was permitted by the man
to try to return to lagrange, and had gone some distance, i was caught
by deserters from the southern army, who voted to shoot me. they bound
me and kept me overnight, intending to do away with me the next day. it
was a lonely desert on the tennessee river. i could not sleep, so all
night i prayed to god, and the wives of the men prayed to god for the
poor "nigger," and also prayed to their cruel husbands. their prayers
prevailed, and i was robbed and let go. i had vowed not to reveal their
whereabouts. i left loving god and believing in his providence as i had
never believed before.
earth has no sorrow that
heaven cannot heal.
i went home and got another spelling-book, although it was not allowed.
some of my own people told my master that i had a book trying to read.
he sent for me to come to the house. i obeyed, though i dreaded to meet
him, not knowing what the consequence would be. but his heart had been
touched by divine power and he simply told me that he heard that i had a
book, and if i was caught with it i would be hung. so i thanked him and
departed. notwithstanding my master's counsel i thirsted for knowledge
and got some old boards and carried them to my house to make a light by
which i could see how to read. i would shut the doors, put one end of a
board into the fire, and proceed to study; but whenever i heard the dogs
barking i would throw my book under the bed and peep and listen to see
what was up. if no one was near i would crawl under the bed, get my
book, come out, lie flat on my stomach, and proceed to study until the
dogs would again disturb me. i did this for many nights. i continued in
this way to try to learn to spell and read as best i could.
blessed are they who hunger and thirst after righteousness,
for they shall be filled.
i, like the ethiopian, wanted a guide. i moved to mrs. mcreynold's. god
bless her! she gave me a lesson every night for a period of four years.
then i went to my old master's brother, whose wife helped me every night
as long as i would go to her for help. rev. shackleford (white) greatly
aided me for a period of three years.
boys and girls, grasp these golden opportunities which are now extended
you from the school room. "unlearned and ignorant" as i was i came along
that way until the present time. my readers have better chances than i
had. so i hope that they will make good use of their time and make my
heart feel glad to see them setting their marks high and preparing
themselves for the great beyond where all must go. thither all nations
will be called before the mighty judgment seat of the ruler of the
universe to give an account for the deeds done in this world. my prayer
for the reader is, that they may make strong, useful, wise and christian
men and women, and at the end of time meet their god in peace.
(chapter —my work)
i will endeaver, in this chapter, to tell something about my works and
whereabouts. i was ordained to the gospel ministry in  by rev. mr.
slater (white), and rev. henry bynum. rev. stephens coleman and rev.
henry bynum, aided by dr. joseph shackleford (white) laid down the
foundation stones for the colored baptist churches in morgan, franklin,
colbert, lauderdale, and lawrence counties, alabama. i am now pastor of
the first baptist church, at tuscumbia, alabama, which is the best negro
edifice in north alabama. this church was organized thirty-five years
ago, by me, with seventy-five members, but it now had a membership of
nine hundred. i have pastored it for lo! these many years. this church
is an excellent brick edifice. a few other brethren and myself organized
the muscle shoals baptist association—one of the oldest and largest
associations in alabama. i have been moderator for four years and its
treasurer for six years. i built the church at russellville, alabama,
and pastored it for four years, and then ordained bro. p. jones and
recommended him as pastor. i built the barten church and pastored it for
a period of fifteen years, after which i recommended rev. james hampton
there as pastor. i pastored the cherokee church five years, ordained
bro. dennis jackson and recommended him there as pastor. i pastored
liberty baptist church for three years, ordained bro. alex brown and
recommended him there as pastor. i served iuka, mississippi for five
years and then recommended a brother from the west, who belonged to the
mt. olive association, to it. i built up the sheffield church, pastored
it three years and then recommended bro. g.b. johnson there as shepherd.
i also built up mt. moriah church at prides, alabama. i frequently
uttered these words:
where jesus leads me i will follow
and his footsteps i'll pursue.
i organized st. paul church (colbert county) and pastored it for two
years. rev. e.c. white, who is now assistant moderator of the muscle
shoals association, was ordained by me. i have ordained more than twenty
preachers to the gospel ministry, baptized six thousand persons, united
in marriage five thousand couples, and buried about seven thousand
persons. i have been faithful to every charge.
hark the voice of jesus calling,
who will and work today?
fields are white and harvest waiting,
who will bear the sheaves away?
i have never left the old land mark. not an one of the churches which
i have pastored has brought a charge against me.
the deepest secrets of our hearts
shall shortly be made known.
i have been married three times and have known no woman but my wife,
"though unlearned and ignorant." i have never had but one "fuss" with my
wife. i told her at one time to hush and she failed to do so, then i
slapped her, after which i went to the lord in prayer and asked to be
forgiven. i regret very much indeed to inform the world in print that i
have been drunk from intoxicating liquors twice, which was before i
professed religion. notwithstanding i have ever held up temperance and
aimed to keep it high until shiloh comes to gather up his jewels. the
following recommendation will show what the best people of tuscumbia
think of me:
tuscumbia, ala., march , 
to whom it may concern:—
we take pleasure in stating that we have known the bearer
of this letter, rev. wilson northcross for a number of years,
and that he is a conscientious, intelligent colored man of
good character. he has been pastor of the missionary baptist
church of this place since the war, having been instrumental
in building the church, and always has made a good citizen.
we believe him in every way worthy of the respect and confidence
of his people.
fox delony, judge of probate
jas. h. simpson, circuit clerk
chas. a. simpson, deputy clerk
w.h. sawtelle
max lueddemann
the following resolution was adopted by the church which i pastored
thirty years:
resolved, that rev. w.e. northcross, our pastor, is a good,
moral, christian man. he has been our pastor for thirty
years, and we can truthfully say that he teaches in all
things by example as well as by precept.
the history of this church has undergone many changes, but they all
worked for its betterment. at the close of the civil war the few members
went from brush arbor to brush arbor for three years. then they held
services in gin houses and under shelters for two years and six months.
then as the church was growing rapidly, they thought best to draw out,
buy a lot, and build to themselves. so they bought a lot for what they
paid fifty dollars ($.) and erected a five hundred dollars ($.)
building thereon in which to worship the lord. so the church continued
to grow until it now has a membership of nine-hundred, a splendid brick
edifice worth about six thousand dollars ($,.) and a thriving
congregation. the church has never had but one pastor, and i have been
as faithful as a clock. through me (rev. w.e. northcross) the church was
built, and i have ever since held high the baptist doctrine throughout
north alabama.
wade owens
interview with wade owens
—preston klein, opelika, alabama
the reverend wade owens of opelika was born in loachapoka, alabama, in
 and just missed slavery, but he has heard his homefolks talk so
much about freeing the negroes, he feels as if he was grown then. his
mother and father, wade and hannah owens, came from virginia and moved
into "jenks quarters" on the berry owens place. they had several
children, wade, nettie, chance, anderson and iowa. wade used to help
drive up the cows. this cabin was of logs, mud and sticks with leaf and
mud chimneys and slab floors. the beds fitted into the wall with plank
sides, two posts with planks nailed on top, resembling tables. a box
served as a dresser.
"all ash-cakes were cooked on poplar an' chestnut leaves, when dey
roasted taters," wade says. "us chillun used to go early in de mornin'
an' lick de honey offen de leaves for sweets den. us didn't wear nothin'
but our long shirts, an' us had homemade hats and brogans, hard as
bricks with brass caps on de toes. i thought dey was de prettiest things
i ever seed.
"marsa berry an' miss fanny owens was good to us niggers. my daddy was
de carriage driver for miss fanny, but take keer of dat man ben boddy,
the overseer. he was de meanes' man god ever put life in. he wouldn't
let us have no fire, matter not how cold, us had to work jes' de same or
de nigger hounds 'ud sho' get you. iffen not dog caught, dey would beat
you to death nearly. he was so mean marsa run him off. dey blew de
risin' horn an' us worked from daylight 'twell dark or frum can to
can't.
"marsa had a pretty two-story log house, big columns an' big porch. he
had 'bout two or three hundred acres an' worked 'bout three hundred
slaves. us had a jail an' locked runaways in hit. brother lockhart used
to preach to us niggers in de white church at lebanon an' us walked to
hit.
"my daddy was sold fer $. when dey put chains on de niggers dey was
put 'roun' de legs and arms an' to a post. dey took pains to ho'p my
mammy an' pappy to learn. dey would teach de bible to 'em too. marsa
used to sing dem good ole songs, 'my heart frum de tomb, a doleful
sound. my ears attend to cry,' and 'amazing grace how sweet it sounds.'
"at baptising dey'd give de water invitation an' den go in water. an'
didn't dey come out happy, shouting and praying? ol' man buck could hear
dem two miles off, but hit was a glorious baptising.
"all de hands stopped when dey was a funeral an' didn't work no mo'
'till de body was buried. all de whites would go too. dey would make de
boxes, pour hot water over de plank to shape it up into a casket, den
take turpentine an' smut to paint it. den another big time, settin' up
wid de dead, sing, shout an' holler an' try to preach.
"de patrollers would come to de colored frolic, an' one time a han'
slipped off an', gentlemen, didn't he give 'em trouble to ketch him, an'
dey didn't. when dey had dem saddy night frolics an' dance all night
long an' nearly day when hit was goin, dey would turn de pot upside down
in de floor to hold de soun' in. my daddy pick de banjo. at de
cornshuckings dey'd sing 'all 'roun' de corn pile sally,' an' dey had
whiskey an' gin. us had good time on chris'mas, give us toys, syrup
candy, light bread an' grape wine.
"my brother married up at de big house an' dey giv' him a big dance an'
marsa made me drunk. 'twas fust one den t'other giv' it to me an'
knocked me out. dey had de preacher an' didn't jump de broom. dey had de
preacher so would be tied good. dey would tell us chillun all kinds of
ghos' stories 'bout witches gittin' outter dey skins. us had free
jumping grapevine ropes an' mumble peg. one night i was at notasulga an'
i heerd some singing. i stopped an' hit was right at my feet an' would
go futher off. i took out wid hit an' hit kept stoppin' an' startin' off
ag'in 'twell hit giv' out entirely. i looked to see where i was an' i
was at de cemetery an' nothin' didn't bother me neither. i eased out an'
shut de gate an' never foun' whut carried me dere.
"when us 'ud git sick, dey would bleed you, stick somp'n in your arm and
draw de blood. den dey would giv' us scurry grass and fever weed.
bone-set was use' as teas for colds an' fever to sweat you. an' hit sho'
would sweat you, too. marsa said war was comin' an' thought hit was to
free us. pappy went to war with young marsa an' stayed 'twell he got
killed.
rev. wade owens, opelika, alabama
"dey hid de carriage horses, meat, silver an' plates. yankees asked
iffen marsa was good, an' us said yes. dey searched de smokehouse an'
some scraps no good an' nothin' but scrappy horses so dey didn't bother
a thing. us stayed one year an' worked on one-eighth farm. the ku klux
klan was turrible. one john lyons would cut off a woman's breast an' a
man's ear or thumb.
"atter i got growed i married leila benford at mr. lockhart's house, an'
us had a nice little frolic, wid cake, syrup pudding an' wine. it was a
fine night wid me, 'caze all kissed de bride. us had fourteen children,
jes' eight living, minnie, wade, robert, walter, viola, joe, jim and
johnnie, an' ten grand-chilun.
"i heered abraham lincoln speak once at chicaumaugee mountain an' he
said 'for people, by people, and through people.' i always 'membered
dat. i jined de church 'caze i got converted."
molly parker
interview with molly parker
—preston klein, opelika, alabama
down in lower lee county i found molly parker, an old acquaintance,
ailing, and with the wandering mind of the aged. she could find answers
to some of my questions, but some she couldn't get straight. she was
just as clean and neat as she had always been, clad in an apron dress
that she would call a "mother huggard."
molly is eighty-five years old and lives with her sister edna in a
simple cabin, with a little patch of flowers between it and the field
where edna is still young enough to work. molly was a housewife's
treasure in the days gone by, but now she is too feeble to do more than
work her little patch of flowers.
molly parker, lee county, alabama
she was born in virginia but was brought to alabama when a child and
sold to a mr. dunn, near salem. her mother and father were john and
fanny, the parents of four children, molly, edna, sam and albert.
"i was a big size housegirl, but i sho' could work," molly recalled.
"mr. digby blowed a big bugle early every morning to get us all up and
going by bright light. mr. digby was a good overseer and treated all de
slaves de best he knew how.
"i married dick parker on a sunday and dey fixed us a big dinner wid
more good things to eat, but i was too happy to eat much myself. i ain't
had no chillun of my own, but i ho'ped mammy with hern.
"de yankees done camped nigh our house, and i had to help cook and tote
de grub down to 'em. us read in de free paper 'bout us being free. massa
didn't tell us nothing, but us stayed on for a long time atter dat.
massa had a passel of slaves.
"yes'm, i'se a member of de church. why i jined? jest for protection, i
reckon.
"i'd hate to see slavery time ag'in, 'cause hit sho' was bad for some of
de niggers, but us fared good though."
lindy patton
interview with lindy patton
—alice s. barton, eutaw, alabama
"white folks," said lindy patton, from a chair in the greene county poor
house. "i was born in  an' it taken me fifty years to git to de po'
house. now i is got jus' fo' mo' years to make it an' even fifty dat i

lindy patton, [tr: eutaw], alabama
"i wukked in de fiel's an' i worked hard all day long. de white folks
useta gimme de clothes of de lil' white chilluns. i was born in
knoxville, alabama, in greene county, an' i belonged to massa bill
patton. i remembers a slave on our plantation dat was always arunnin'
away. de massa try beatin' him but dat didn't do no good. dat nigger
would run away in spite of nothin' they could do. one day de massa
decided he was goin' to take de nigger to mobile an' swap him for
anudder one. de misstis tol' him to leave de ole fool alone, said it
warn't worth the trouble. well, de massa started out to mobile wid de

"nawsuh, de white folks didn't teach us to read or write. white folks, i
can't hardly count none at all. we didn't have no church on dat place
neither. we jus' went along wid de massa an' sot in de back. i ain't
never ma'ied, an' i ain't never goin' to."
simon phillips
interview with simon phillips
—j. morgan smith
simon phillips, ex-slave, at  years is still as clear-thinking as a
young man, and a leader among the oldsters of his race in birmingham and
alabama. he has been for the past twenty-three years president of the
union of ex-slaves which is composed of , negroes scattered
throughout alabama. he is the only one of the birmingham organizers of
the society living today and though one of the oldest of his group, he
shows but few signs of decrepitude. he walks with the aid of a hickory
cane which has been in his possession for almost a half century, and his
memory is not only accurate but vivid. his physical activity is shown by
the fact that he had already spaded his garden and tiny stalks had
pushed themselves above the ground on a plot of earth, covering
approximately seventy-five yards square, on the spring morning when he
took "a little time off" to talk of the past.
well does he recall the days when, under alabama skies in the 's, he
curried his master's fine carriage horses; the times old aunt hannah
cured him of "achin's" with vegetable and root herbs; the nights he
spent in the slave quarters singing spirituals with his family.
simon phillips was one of  negroes belonging to bryant watkins, a
planter of greensboro, alabama. he was a house man, which means that he
mixed the drinks, opened the carriage doors, brought refreshments on the
porch to guests, saw that the carriage was always in the best of
condition and tended the front lawn. when asked about slave days, he
gets a far-away expression in his eyes; an expression of tranquil joy.
"people," he says, "has the wrong idea of slave days. we was treated
good. my massa never laid a hand on me durin' the whole time i was wid
him. he scolded me once for not bringin' him a drink when i was supposed
to, but he never whup me."
the old slave added that every plantation had a still and there was much
brandy, but he rarely ever saw a drunk man. he says that when the men
felt themselves becoming intoxicated, they would go home and lie down;
now, he says, they go home and fall down.
the plantation on which simon lived was seven miles long and three miles
wide. when luncheon was served, the negroes far off in the bottom lands
had their food brought to them by the trash gang (boys and women) while
those in the nearer cotton fields ate in a large mess hall. the food
consisted of turnip greens, meat, peas, crackling bread and syrup, and
plenty of it. "not since those days," he states, "have i had such good
food."
"what about the marriage situation, simon?" he was asked. "how did you
go about getting a wife?"
"well, nigger jus' go to the massa and tell him that there's a gal over
in cap'n smith's place that he want for a wife, if she happen to be
there. then the massa go to cap'n smith and offer to buy her. maybe he
do and maybe he don't. it depend on whether the cap'n will sell her, and
iffen she a good strong, healthy nigger. niggers was bought mostly like
hosses. i was too young to have me a wife when i was wid de massa, but i
got me one later on after the war."
simon phillips, birmingham, alabama
during the war between the states, simon served as body guard for john
edward watkins, son of the plantation owner. body guards went with
their owners and cleaned the guns, kept the camp in order and did some
cooking. simon entered the war at the age of fourteen in joe wheeler's
st cavalry. he distinctly recalls the time he stood within ten feet of
the great general while he was making a speech.
sometimes slaves were parted from their families, because when one
planter bought a negro from another planter, he did not necessarily buy
his wife or children, or husband, as the case might be. the slaves were
advertised around and put on a block to stand while they were auctioned.
women invariably brought more than men. he was asked, "about overseers,
simon. what sort of men were they?"
"well," he answered, "some was mighty mean. when the massa be away, they
tried to think up things to whup us for. but when the massa around, had
he catch 'em gettin' ready for to beat a slave, he say, 'don't cut no
blood from that nigger!'"
born in hale county in , simon phillips stayed with his master until
 at which time he went to live in tuscaloosa to earn ¢ a day, but
he says he fared better on it than on three dollars now.
after the war many negroes stayed with their masters and he remembers
that some of the carpetbaggers came through his plantation and tried to
make the ex-slaves stake off the land, saying that half of it belonged
to them.
"one day," says simon, "a few niggers was stickin' sticks in the ground
when the massa come up.
"'what you niggers doin'?' he asked.
"'we is stakin' off de land, massa. the yankees say half of it is
ourn.'
"the massa never got mad. he jus' look calm like.
"'listen, niggers' he says, 'what's mine is mine, and what's yours is
yours. you are just as free as i and the missus, but don't go foolin'
around my land. i've tried to be a good master to you. i have never been
unfair. now if you wants to stay, you are welcome to work for me. i'll
pay you one third the crops you raise. but if you wants to go, you sees
the gate.'
"the massa never have no more trouble. them niggers jus' stays right
there and works. sometime they loaned the massa money when he was hard
pushed. most of 'em died on the old grounds. i was the youngest of a
family of sixteen and i has one sister still livin' on the old
plantation. i'm going down to see her next week, 'cause i can never tell
when the great master is goin' to call. we's gotta be ready when he
does, and both us is gettin' mighty old. i wanta be sure and see her and
the old place once more."

carrie pollard
interview with carrie pollard
—ruby pickens tartt, livingston, alabama
carrie pollard was born in slavery time but she was never a slave. her
grandmother was a free woman who came to tuscaloosa as a servant in the
's and was rescued from a man who claimed ownership, but whose claim
was disallowed. the grandmother went to gainesville, with her slave
husband for whom she bought freedom.
one of her daughters, who was carrie pollard's aunt cynthia, was not so
lucky. she couldn't buy her husband free. the story, told so often to
carrie when she was a child, is still a bright memory to the mulatto
woman who was born in  and still lives in gainesville in the house
of her birth.
carrie pollard, gainesville, alabama
"my aunt cynthy," said carrie, "was free born in north carolina. she
come down here to gainesville, an' though the deed sez you can't take a
blue veined chile an' make a slave outa her, de man whut brought her
made like he owned her or sump'in'. she lived on one plantation wid her
guardian. tom dobbs, a slave nigger whut belonged to mr. dobbs here in
gainesville, he lived on another farm cross de road. an' dey couldn't
marry, 'caze mr. dobbs wouldn't sell tom an' aunt cynthy's white folks
wouldn't let her marry, so dey jes' taken up an' went ahead. her an' tom
had nine chillun, as fine looking mulattoes ez you'd wanta see. an' old
mr. dobbs wanted 'em an' he couldn't get 'em.
"aunt cynthy was a good midwife, so a white lady sent fer her to come to
sumterville, alabama, to nuss her an' she went. an' while she was dere,
she dream't sump'in' done happened to her chillun an' dat dey was in
trouble. so she tole de white lady she was nussin' 'bout whut she
dream't an' she said, 'mammy, iffen you is worried 'bout your chillun
i'ze gwineter send you to a fortune teller an' see whut's de matter.'
"de fortune teller cut de cards, an' den she looked up en tole aunt
cynthia 'all yo' chillun an' your husband done gone an' i can't tell you
where dey's at.' so aunt cynthia run back an' tole de white lady. she
called her husband an' he had one of his niggers saddle up two hosses
an' ride wid aunt cynthy back to gainesville. when she foun' her
guardian, mr. steele, he met her wid de news dat dey was tuck to dekalb,
mississippi.
"he got on his hoss an' tuck some other white men wid him, an' dey
captured old man dobbs right dere wid tom an' de nine chillun. dey done
stopped an' camped an' was cookin' supper. so mr. steele tole him he
could keep tom, 'caze he was hissen, an' a slave, but cynthy was free
born an' he couldn't have her chillun. but mr. dobbs sez he didn't want
tom nohow, caze he was part indian an' no 'count an' wouldn't work. so
mr. steele bought tom for aunt cynthy an' brought 'em all back to live
wid him. an' he give aunt cynthy an' tom an' de chillun a nice house
right 'cross de branch here after surrender."
carrie tells of how her grandmother used to send them to the mill in
gainesville with wheat, "jes' lack you do corn nowadays, to git flour.
an' us git de grudgins an' de seconds an' have de bes' buckwheat cakes
you ever et."
she says there are more black negroes now in gainesville than she has
ever seen. she says, "hit use to be a sight to see 'bout fifty bes'
lookin' mulatto girls up in de public square here listenin' to de ban'
an' nussen' de chillun, not five black ones in de bunch. an' dey had
good sense, too. us didn't have no clocks, so us white mistis would say,
'yawl come home a hour by sun to do de night work,' an' us didn't hardly
ever miss it." she says her grandmother sent her two daughters to school
in mobile, and they went down the river from gainesville in a river boat
called cremonia.
irene poole
interview with irene poole
—susie r. o'brien, uniontown, alabama
under the spreading branches of an enormous fig tree laden with ripe
fruit "aunt irene" sat dreaming of old times. at her feet several
chickens scratched and waited for the soft plop of an over ripe fig as
it fell to the ground.
aunt irene's back is bent with age and rheumatism, but her two-room
cabin is as clean and neat as a pin. her small yard is a mass of color
where marigolds, zinnias, verbena and cockscomb run riot, and over the
roughly-made arch at the gate trailed cypress vine in full bloom. "good
morning aunt irene," i said. "a penny for your thoughts."
"well honey, i don't know as dey is wo'th a penny; not to you anyhow. i
was jes' stud'in' 'bout ole times an' 'bout mah ole marster. you know if
he was livin' today he would be a hundred an' sixteen years ole."
"who was your master aunt irene? tell me about him."
"his name was jeff anderson poole an' he was de bes' man in de world.
mah ole miss was name mollie. i was born on his plantation three miles
from uniontown eighty five years ago.
"mah pappy, alfred poole, b'longed to marse jeff an' he bought mah
mammy, palestine kent, from another plantation 'cause mah pappy jes'
couldn' do no work fer thinkin' 'bout her.
"marse jeff paid fifteen hunderd dollars for my mammy an' her three
little chillun. marse jeff was rich, he owned three big plantations an'
lawd knows how many niggers. dey was a hunderd head on our plantation.
he lacked to race horses an' had a stable full o' fine racers. i spec'
he made lots o' his money on dem horses. miss mollie say when he win he
swell out his ches' an' stick his thum's in de armhole of his ves' an'
talk 'bout it, but when he lose he don't say nothin'.
"yas ma'am dere was always plenty to eat. a thousan' poun's o' meat
wasn't nothin' to kill on our plantation. my mammy was de cook in de big
house an' my pappy driv de carriage an' went 'roun' wid marse jeff when
he tuck trips. i was a house servant too. when i wasn' nothin' mo' in a
baby, de oberseer's wife tuck me to train, so i would know how to ac' in
de big house.
"one day she started to give me a whuppin'. us was out in de yard an'
when she bent over to git a switch i runned under her hoopskirt. when
she look 'roun' she didn't see me nowhar. after while she started on up
to de house an' i runned along wid her under de hoopskirt, takin' little
steps so i wouldn't trip her up, till i seed a chance to slip out."
irene threw back her head and laughed loud and long at this amusing
memory.
asked then about her mistress she said: "yas ma'am she was good. she
never punished me, she used to go 'roun' de quarters eve'y mornin' to
see 'bout her sick niggers. she always had a little basket wid oil,
teppentine an' number six in it. number six was strong medicine. you had
to take it by de drap. i always toted de basket. she gived me mah
weddin' dress. it was white tarletan wid ban's o' blue ribbin. i sole de
dress las' year but i can show you de pantalets she made me. i used to
wear 'em to meetin' on sunday when us had singin' an' de preacher said
words." aunt irene brought out the deep ruffled pantalets carefully
folded and yellow with age, she had treasured them for seventy-five
years.
"no ma'am, marse jeff didn't go to de war, i don't know why. i guess it
was 'cause he was so rich. now don't you be thinkin' he was gun shy,
'cause he wasn't an' he done his part too 'cause he took keer o' five
widders an' dey chillun when dey men got kilt in de war.
"my pappy lef de night de yankees tuck selma. it was on sunday, an' i
ain't seed him since.
"after de surrender us staid on with marse jeff. us didn't keer nothin'
'bout bein' free 'cause us had good times on de plantation. on sadday
dey had corn shuckin's an' de niggers had a week at chris'mas wid
presents for eve'ybody. camping at de big house an' mo' to eat in one
day den i sees now in a year.
"aunt irene, do you remember anything about the conjurers in the old
days?"
"i don't put much sto' by dem folks. dey used to give you de han' so you
could please yo' mistess an' dey would sell you hush water in a jug.
hush water was jes' plain water what dey fixed so if you drink it you
would be quiet an' patient. de mens would git it to give to dey wives to
make 'em hush up. i reckon some of de mens would be glad to git some now
'cause gals dese days is got too much mouf."
nicey pugh
interview with nicey pugh
—ila b. prine, [hw: mobile]
"i was bawn a slave, but i ain't neber been a slave", was aunt nicey's
first remark to me as i came upon her pulling up potato draws in her
garden in prichard, alabama. "dere was 'leben chilluns in my family an'
all 'em is daid ceptin' me an' one brother who is seventy-five year old
at de present time. my pappy's name was hamp west an' my mammy was sarah
west. all my folks belonged to massa jim bettis, an' was born an' raised
on his place.
"when i was a little pickaninny i worked in massa jim's house,
sweepin' an' a-cleanin'. us slaves had to be up at de house by sunup,
build de fires an' git de cookin' started. dey had big open fireplaces
wid potracks to hang de pot on. dat's whar us boiled de vegetables. an'
honey, us sho had plenty somp'n' t'eat: greens, taters, peas, rosenyurs
an' plenty of home killed meat. sometimes my oldest brother, joe west,
an' friday davis, anudder nigger, went huntin' at night an' kotched mo'
possums dan we could eat. dey'd ketch lots of fish; 'nuf to las' us
three days.
"i remembers one day when me an' anudder little nigger gal was agoin'
atter de cows down in de fiel' an' us seed whut i reckon' was de ku klux
klan. us was so skeered us didn't know whut to do. one of 'em walked up
to us an' say: 'niggers, whar you agoin'?'
"'us is jus' atter de cows, mr. ku klux,' us say. 'us ain't up to no
debilment.'
"'all right den,' dey say, 'jus' you be sho dat you don't git up to
none.'
"atter we got home us told de massa 'bout de 'sperience, an' he jus'
laugh. he tol' us dat we warn't goin' to be hurt iffen we was good; he
say dat it was only de bad niggers dat was goin' to be got atter by dem
ku klux.
"when we was little we didn't hab no games to play, kaze massa jim an'
miss marfa didn't hab no chilluns, an' i ain't neber had no speriences
wid ha'nts or hoodoos. dey neber teach us to read or write kaze when de
niggers learn anything, dey would git upitty an' want to run away. we
would hab sad'day afternoons off, den us would sweep de yards, an' set
aroun' on benches an' talk. it was on de benches dat mos' of us slaves
set in warm weather. we et outen tin cups an' us used iron spoons to
shovel de food in.
"at christmas time, massa would have a bunch of niggers to kill a hog
an' barbecue him, an' de womens would make 'lasses cake, an' ole massa
jim had some kinda seed dat he made beer outen, an' we-alls drank beer
'roun' christmas.
"but dere warn't no udder time such as new years. us all celebrated in a
big way den. most of dem no 'count niggers stayed drunk fo' three days.
"an' as fo' de funerals, i don't eber remember but three white folks
dyin'. dey jus' didn't seem to die in dem days, an' de ones dat did die
was mostly kilt by somp'n'. one white gentman got hisself kilt in a gin
'chinery an' anudder was kilt a workin' on de big road. den dere was a
white 'oman who was kilt by a nigger boy kaze she beat him for sicking a
dog on a fine milk cow. he was de meanest nigger boy i eber seed. i'll
neber forgits de way dem white mens treated him atter he done had his
trial. dey drug him through de town behin' a hoss, an' made him walk
ober sharp stones wid his bare feets, dat bled lak somebody done cut 'em
wid a knife. dey neber gib him no water all dat day an' kep' him out in
de boilin' sun till dey got ready to hang him. when dey got ready to
hang him dey put him up on a stand and chunked rocks at his naked body;
dey thro gravel in his eyes and broke his ribs wid big rocks. den dey
put a rope around his neck an' strung him up till his eyes pop outen his
head. i knowed it was a blessin' to him to die.
"but all and all, white folks, den was de really happy days for us
niggers. course we didn't hab de 'vantages dat we has now, but dere wus
somp'n' back dere dat we ain't got now, an' dat's secu'aty. yassuh, we
had somebody to go to when we was in trouble. we had a massa dat would
fight fo' us an' help us an' laugh wid us an' cry wid us. we had a
mistis dat would nuss us when we was sick, an' comfort us when we hadda
be punished. i sometimes wish i could be back on de ole place. i kin see
de cool-house now packed wid fresh butter an' milk an' cream. i can see
de spring down amongst de willows an' de water a trickling down between
little rocks. i can hear de turkeys a gobblin' in de yard and de
chickens a runnin' aroun' in de sun, an' shufflin' in de dus'. i can see
de bend in de creek jus' below our house, an' de cows as dey come to
drink in de shallow water an' gits dere feets cool.
nicey pugh, prichard, alabama
"yassuh, white folks, you ain't neber seed nothin' lak it so you can't
tell de joy you gits f'um lookin' for dewberries an' a-huntin' guinea
pigs, an' settin' in de shade of a peach tree, reachin' up an' pullin'
off a ripe peach and eatin' it slow. you ain't neber seed your people
gathered 'bout an' singin' in de moonlight or heered de lark at de break
of day. you ain't neber walked acrost a frosty fiel' in de early
mornin', an' gone to de big house to build a fire for your mistis, an'
when she wake up slow have her say to you: 'well, how's my little nigger
today?'
"nawsuh, jus' lak i told you at fus'. i was bawn a slave, but i ain't
neber been one. i'se been a worker for good peoples. you wouldn't calls
dat bein' a slave would you, white folks?"
sally reynolds
personal conversation with sallie reynolds
 south conception street, mobile, alabama
—compiled by mary a. poole
sally reynolds, living at  south conception street, was busy at the
wash tub when the writer called to interview her on july , , so it
being a hot day we decided to continue our conversation out doors under
the washshed amid a conglomeration of tubs, buckets, empty boxes, etc.
sallie said she was born in hiltown, georgia, where her mother margaret
owens was a slave and the cook on the plantation of mr. lit albritton.
when sallie was about three years of age her mother gave her to mrs.
becke albritton, who lived at new providence, near rutledge in crenshaw
county, alabama, to whom she was bound until  years of age. there was
also a brother given by her mother to some folks in florida and of whom
sallie never had any knowledge whatever.
sallie said mrs. albritton was kind to her, taught her to spin and
sew, and she tried to learn herself to weave, but, somehow, could never
master it.
mrs. albritton had only a few slaves who were named, mose, dan, charles,
sandy (the latter so called because he ate sand as a child), and two
women, hannah and tene.
they had no regular quarters but just cabins out in a rear lot.
sallie said all the whippings were given by either of the young messrs.
albritton, they were high tempered, as their father was before them. she
laughed and said she had indian blood in her veins and sometimes she was
sassy as she felt independent knowing mrs. albritton would always take
her part.
she recalled the yankee's coming through after the war, one remained at
the albritton home after the others had gone on, and she remembered
hearing mrs. albritton telling friends who visited her, that after this
soldier had left he wrote mrs. albritton a letter, telling her to look
on the back of the bench on the gallery where he had sat and she would
find his message. sallie said she was a little girl sitting on the floor
at her mistress feet, ready to fetch and carry for her and she often
wondered but didn't dare ask what the message was; she did, however,
hear some one say that the yankees said, if they ever came again, they
would take them from the cradle and that puzzled her, to know just what
they meant.
mrs. albritton had a regular herb garden and sallie helped her to gather
the herbs, pennyroil, dock sage, tansy (single and double), thyme, and
yarrow. they used samson snake root in whiskey for cramps, and butterfly
weed for risings.
the writer asked sallie about church and she said they had no church but
mr. albritton talked to her and impressed on her as a child to never
touch anything that did not belong to her. "ask for it and if not given
to her, to let it alone and to never lie, or to carry tales, and she
could always keep out of trouble." sallie said she hated to see sunday
morning come, as the men folks were around the house and they would pick
on her and somehow she would get a beating.
sallie remained with mrs. albritton until she was  years, when she
married john russell, by whom she had three children. they all died as
babies, later she married gus reynolds, (now dead) so sallie just rents
a room and lives alone.
sallie says present generation knows too much and too little, that the
"old-time religion" was best for all, she thinks "satan's goin' 'round
wid his tail curled up, catching all he can devour"; and "folks should
do like christ did when satan tried to tempt him, and tell satan to go
get behind them, and they get behind jesus they could not have sorrow
run across their hearts and minds."
mary rice
interview with mary rice
—gertha couric, [hw: eufaula]
few of the ex-slaves will readily admit that they were mere field hands
in the old days. generally they prefer to leave the impression that they
were house servants, or at least stable boys or dairy hands.
but "aunt" mary rice, age , who lives in eufaula, holds no such view
about the superior social position of house servants. she was a "big
missy gal" ('teen age) during the war, and about her duties on the
plantation of dr. cullen battle near tuskegee, where she was born, she
said:
"honey, i lived in de quahter. i was a fiel' nigger, but when i was a
lil' gal, i helped around de milk-house, churnin', washing de pails and
de lak, and den give all de little niggers milk.
mary rice, eufaula, alabama
"massa cullen and mistis' ma'y jane was de bes' marster and mistis' in
de worl'. once when i was awful sick, mistis' ma'y jane had me brung in
de big house and put me in a room dat sot on de 'tother side of the
kitchen so she could take kere of me herself 'cause it was a right fur
piece to de quahter and i had to be nussed day and night.
"yassum, i was jes' as happy bein' a fiel' han' as i would'er been at de
big house; mebbe mo' so. de fiel' han's had a long spell when de crops
was laid by in de summer and dat's when massa cullen 'lowed us to
'jubilate' (several days of idle celebration). i was happy all de time
in slavery days, but dere ain't much to git happy over now, 'cep'n i's
livin'—thank de lawd. massa cullen was a rich man, and owned all de
worl' from chestnut hill to de ribers, and us always had eberything us
needed.
"niggers dese days ain't neber knowed whut good times is. mebbe dat's
why dey ain't no 'count. and dey is so uppity, too, callin' dereselves
'cullud folks and havin' gold teeth. dey sez de mo' gold teeth dey has,
de higher up in chu'ch dey sets. huh!"
cornelia robinson
interview with cornelia robinson
—preston klein, opelika, alabama
"one time i 'members a storm us had. i calls it a harricane; but it was
really de yankees comin' through."
quaint, little cornelia robinson was anxious to give all the facts she
could remember about slavery days; but she was only about four years old
during the latter days of that period, and must depend a great deal on
what has been told her.
"chile, dem yankees come through an' cleaned out de smokehouse; even
lef' de lard bucket as clean as yo' hand. ol' marster tuk his bes'
horses an' mules to de big swamp, an' de yankees couldn't fin' 'em. but
dey tore up everything dey couldn't take wid dem. dey poured all de
syrup out an' it run down de road lak water.
"one pore little nigger boy was so skeered dat when he went out to git
up de cows an' when he couldn't fin' some of 'em, he laid down in a
hollow stump an' nearly froze to death. dey had to thaw him out in de
branch, but he was powerful sick. he war'nt no 'count for nothin' atter
dat.
"i 'members dat ol' mistus saved all her jewels an' sech frum de
yankees. she brung 'em out to de nigger cabins an' hid 'em amongst us."
cornelia, forever smiling, wears her gray hair in two short braids down
the back. she says her father and mother were george and harriett
yancey, who belonged first to a mrs. baugh and who were later sold to a
dr. trammell, of near lafayette. her brothers and sisters were charlie,
willie, albert and ann.
cornelia robinson, opelika, alabama
"i 'members de high, four-poster beds us useter sometimes sleep on," she
said. "i was so little dat i had to crawl into 'em wid de help of a
stool. i 'members dat de mud fireplaces of early times was far back,
deep an' wide. all de little niggers was fed milk an' bread, wid de
bread crumbled in. us also had pot licker an' greens.
"our clothes was muslin an' calico for de hot weather; an' den in winter
us had linty cloth, part wool an' part cotton, homespun. us raised de
sheep, too, but us didn't wear no clothes hardly in hot weather.
"us sho' did have a good marster an' mistis. dey give us all de clothes
an' food us needed an' gived us medicine. us wore asafetida an' pennies
aroun' our necks to help us not to git sick.
"dey taught my mother to read an' write, too. not many done dat. she'd
read de bible to us little niggers an' give prayers. atter slavery, us
had schools. i 'members dat george hawkins an' his wife taught it."
cornelia recalls some of the happenings of slavery times.
"if de slaves went off de plantation widout a pass, de patterollers
would ketch 'em an' beat 'em powerful bad. if de niggers could outrun de
patterollers an' git home fust dey couldn't be whupped. dey had dogs
called 'nigger hounds', same like dey had bird dogs, an' dey would track
de slaves an' bring dem back home.
"i 'members my mother goin' to corn shuckin's. 'course dey put us little
niggers to bed 'fore dey went but dey sho' sounded lak dey was havin' a
big time, hollerin' an' singin'. us went to de white folks church in de
afternoon, an' de reverend gardner was a mighty good preacher. when any
of us niggers died, marster was good to us an' let all de niggers quit
an' attend de burial. dey made de coffins at home an' would black dem
wid soot.
"us had a ol' quack herb doctor on de place. some bad boys went up to
his house one night an' poured a whole lot of de medicine down him. an
honey, dat ol' man died de next day.
"atter i got grown i married robert benson an' us had four chillun and
several grandchillun."
cornelia, beaming and apparently happy every minute of the day, lives
with one of her grandchildren in opelika.
gus rogers
interview with gus rogers
—mary a. poole, mobile, alabama
living on the moffat road at orchard, in western mobile county, alabama,
on mr. mcintyre's place is gus rogers, who is known better by the name
of jabbo. he claims to be over ninety years of age, but could give no
proof. he claims the th of june as his birthday.
when asked how old he was, he replied with a smile:
"miss, i don't know but i found everything here when i came along."
he was born at salisbury, n.c. on the rogers' plantation, and mr. john
and mrs. mary rogers were his master and mistress. his parents were
william and lucy rogers, who had five children, three girls and two
boys.
jabbo said the rogers's home was built of boards of virgin timber and
the slave quarters were some distance from the big house. some of the
cabins were built of logs and some of boards, all having clay chimneys
and big open fireplaces equipped for cooking, as the slaves usually
cooked their own meals, except during busy seasons, when meals were
prepared in the house kitchen by the slave women too old to work in the
fields.
jabbo said one old man went around and rapped on the doors to wake up
slaves to go to work. when asked how long they worked he laughed, and
said:
"just from sun to sun and then you went to bed, 'cause you knew that old
man would sure be rapping before you were ready next morning."
when asked about earning any money, jabbo said:
"law, miss we didn't even know what money was, and we didn't have no
use for it. we had all we needed, plenty to eat and all the clothes
necessary those days."
the rogers raised lots of tobacco and wheat, and all the necessary farm
products needed on the plantation. they had a large orchard and made all
the cider they could drink.
jabbo recalled driving many a refugee wagon during the war, and when
they heard of the yankees' coming, the rogers family took all the horses
and mules and hid them in the swamps and buried all the silver and other
valuables.
after the devastation wrought by war, mr. rogers moved his family to
massey station, montgomery county, alabama, intending to raise cotton.
he brought jabbo's father and mother and family with him, but meeting
with little success he returned to salisbury, n.c. jabbo remained in
alabama.
jabbo married and raised a family of five children. there were two girls
and three boys but he has no knowledge of their present whereabouts.
when asked if he was married more than once, jabbo laughed and said:
"no, miss i always had the price of a marriage license in my pocket, but
somehow i never married."
in answer to inquiry as to religion, jabbo replied:
"miss, i am a methodist, but there's only one religion. you have to be
pure in heart to see him, because he said so, and to do unto others as
you desire others to do unto you."
continuing about religion jabbo said:
"god gave it to adam and took it away from adam and gave it to noah, and
you know, miss, noah had three sons, and when noah got drunk on wine,
one of his sons laughed at him, and the other two took a sheet and
walked backwards and threw it over noah. noah told the one who laughed,
'you children will be hewers of wood and drawers of water for the
other's two children, and they will be known by their hair and their
skin being dark,' so, miss, there we are, and that is the way god meant
us to be. we have always had to follow the white folks and do what we
saw them do, and that's all there is to it. you just can't get away from
what the lord said."
jabbo said he would like "to go back to the good old days, 'though there
was good folks and there was mean folks, then too, just like there is
today."

ex-slave, better known as "jabbo."
janie scott
personal interview with janie scott
 south lawrence street, mobile, alabama
—mary a. poole, mobile, alabama
janie scott, living in a cottage at  south lawrence street, was
interviewed by the writer on july th, . she claimed she was born
april , , but she appeared older than seventy years of age. she,
of course, was unable to give any experiences of her own as a slave but
recalled what had been told her by her mother, who was a slave on the
myers plantation at tensaw, alabama.
when asked how large was the plantation, janie answered:
"lordy, chile, many an acre an 'bout sixty slaves."
her mother worked in the house, and when the field hands were working
helped carry water out to them in buckets, each one getting a swallow or
two a piece. her father was andy white, and was raised on the plantation
of john jewett at stockton, alabama.
janie had heard her father say he was a coachman and drove the folks
around, also came over in a boat with his master to mobile to get
supplies and groceries, and that they killed many a deer in
neighborhoods just north of bienville square.
jane said her mother's master and mistress didn't want her mother to
marry andy, because he was too light in color and light niggers janie
said folks didn't think as strong as a good black one, so her mother,
sarah porter, and andy white her father just borrowed a mule without the
master's consent and rode off and were married, anyhow.
janie laughed and said she guessed it was all right after all because
they had eleven children, two are now living, janie and a sister daisy.
when the writer asked if slaves ever earned any money, she replied:
"they didn't even know what money was." then she continued: "once when
my mother was a little girl she asked her mistress to give her fifteen
cents, and her mistress wanted to know why she wanted fifteen cents.
her mother replied: "i wants to see what money looks like."
her mistress thought she was trying to act smart and in place of fifteen
cents she received a whipping.
the slaves wore homespun clothes, but her mother remembered having as
her best dress one made of marino.
the slaves quarters were log cabins with clay chimneys, and they cooked
in the open fireplaces in the winter and in the summer on what they
called scaffolds, built out in the yard. these were made of clay
foundations with iron rods across on which the pots hung.
janie said her mother "was strong and could roll and cut logs like a
man, and was much of a woman." then they had a log rolling on a
plantation the negroes from the neighboring plantations came and worked
together until all the jobs were completed.
after each log rolling they gave them molasses to make candy and have a
big frolic.
during the civil war when supplies were scarce, especially salt, marster
john rode off taking her mother's sister ca'line with him, and when he
returned alone his wife, mrs. meyers, wanted to know where was ca'line,
and marster john replied: "i sold her for a sack of salt." at first they
did not believe him, but ca'line never returned and sarah never saw her
sister anymore.
after the surrender the yankees came through and the slaves hid under
the house, but the soldiers made them come out and told them they were
free, and gave the slaves everything on the place to eat. they all went
down to the creek and praised god for what he had done for them.
janie does not believe in charms, hoodoo or fortune-tellers, saying:
"those folks can't tell you nothing. when christ was risen he carried
all prophets with him and didn't leave any wise folks able to tell
things going to happen here on earth—everything christ wanted folks to
know had already happened."
janie did say the best charm she knew of was a bag of asafetida worn
around the neck to ward off sickness or to take nine or ten drops in a
little water would sure keep the worms down.
the slaves got plenty of coons, rabbits and bear meat, and could go
fishing on sundays, as well as turtle hunting.
the overseer on the myers plantation was not a mean man, they had a
calaboose or sweat box to punish unruly slaves in place of whipping
them.
after the surrender her father and mother moved to mobile, alabama, and
her father continued to work for mr. jewett at his mill located at the
foot of palmetto street on the mobile river front.
maugan shepherd
interview with maugan shepherd
—gertha couric, [hw: eufaula]
"mistus, i hears slavery times is comin' back."
uncle maugan shepherd is past . he idled about the front of his
tumble-down house in eufaula, happily recalling the old plantation days.
he has never learned to read, and therefore pins a great deal of
dependence upon hearsay.
"where did you hear about slavery coming back?" the interviewer asked
him.
"well, mam, 'pear lak i heard it somewhar. i don't rikolect jest now."
"would you like to have the old times back again, uncle maugan?"
he studied a moment, beamed:
"yassum, i would. i'se proud i was borned a slave. i'se too young to
'member much, but i knows i always had enough to eat and wear den, and i
sho don't now.
uncle maugan said that he was "birthed" at chestnut hill; that he
belonged to marse and mistus rich wiley, and that his father and mother
were bunk and betsy wiley, both "field niggers." maugan had two
brothers, oliver and monroe; but no sisters.
"i never seed ma and pa much 'cept on sundays," he explained. "dey was
allus workin' in de fields an' i was out chasin' rabbits an' sech mos'
of de time. at night i jest et my cornpone an' drink my buttermilk an'
fell on de bed asleep."
maugan remembers one overseer, scornfully referring to him as "po' white
trash."
"us slaves called him by his las' name behin' his back," the
old darky explained, "'caze us hated to 'mister' dat white man."
maugan remembers reconstruction and a great deal about "atter de
surrender," but says "rickolection ain't so good" on things that
happened before.
"i 'members dat i was powerful scared of de yankee soldiers," he said,
"but dey never hurt nobody. dey come through eufaula an' all us niggers
tried to hide; but dey jest come on by an' laughed at us fer bein'
scared."
maugan shepherd, eufaula, alabama
more than fifty years ago, maugan married kitty. she is about  and
makes her living washing clothes for "de white peoples." they never had
any children.
maugan says he never goes anywhere except to church on sundays. his legs
are not so strong anymore, he explains.
"my ol' 'oman, she sho' lak to go to funerals," he chuckled. "but in
dese days day takes de body to have it vulcanized, so we can't have no
settin' ups. dis went hard on kitty, 'caze she was a mourner; but it
didn't do her no good, shoutin' an' amournin' all night. she would
always come home wid her head tied up an' her eyes set back in her
head."
maugan still works. he is a good yardman, but says some day he is just
"gwine ter drap out, lak his pa did."
allen sims
interview with allen sims
—preston klein, opelika
while interviewing former slaves in the rural sections of lee county, i
ran across allen sims, a sturdy old negro, who proved to have an
unusually clear recollection of slavery as the institution appeared to
the small boy of that era. he was not old enough to make a work-hand at
its close. he spoke slowly, but with evident positiveness as to the
facts:
"i 'members lots 'bout slavery times; 'cause i was right dar. i don't
'member much 'bout de war, 'cause i was too little to know what war was,
and de most i seed was when de yankees come through and burnt up de big
house, de barns, de ginhouse and took all old marster's hosses and
mules, and kilt de milk-cows for beef. they didn't leave us nothing to
eat, and us lak to starve to death.
"our folks, de simses, dey come fum virginny. my pappy and mammy was
borned dere. dey names was allen sims and kitty sims. my old marster was
marse jimmie sims, and my old mistis was miss creasie. some of pappy and
mammy's chillun was borned in virginny, and some of 'em in alabama. i
was de baby chile, and i was borned right on dis very place whar us is
now. dey had a whole passel of chillun. dere was chaney, becky, judy,
sam, phoebe, king, alex, jordan and allen—dat's me.
"us lived in a log house in de quarter, wid a board roof and a ol' rock
fireplace wid a stick and dirt chimley. we had plenty wood, and could
build jes' as big fire as we need, if de weather was cold. mammy, she
cook ash-cake in de fireplace, and it was de bes' bread i ever eat,
better'n any dis store-bought bread. you ain't never eat no ash-cake?
umph, missy, you don't know what good bread is lak!
"old marster was good to his niggers and all of 'em, big and little had
plenty to eat, and it wa'n't trash neither. us had ash-cake, hoe-cake,
pone-bread, meat and gravy, peas, greens, roast-neers, pot-liquor, and
sweet 'taters, i'ish taters, and goobers—i spec old marster's niggers
live better dan lots of white folks lives now.
"aunt mandy, what was too old to work, looked atter all de little nigger
chilluns, whilst dey mammys was working, and she whip us wid a brush, if
we didn't mind her; but she fuss more dan she whip, and it didn't hurt
much, but us cry lak she killing us.
"when us got sick, old mistis looked atter us herself, and she gin us
oil and turpentine and lobelia and if dat didn't cure us, she sont for
de doctor—de same doctor dat come to see her own fambly. sometime a old
nigger die, and old marster and old mistis dey cry jes' lak us did. dey
put 'em in a coffin and bury 'em in de graveyard, wid de white preacher
dar and nobody didn't work none dat day, atter us come back fum de
graveyard.
"our beds was bunks in de corner of de room, nailed to de wall and jes'
one post out in de flo'. de little chilluns slep' crosswise de big bed
and it was plum' full in cold weather.
allen sims, lee county, alabama
"our clothes was osnaburg, spun and weave' right at home, and it sho'
did last a long time. de little niggers jes' wore a long shirt, 'twell
dey got big 'nough to work in de field, and us had red shoes made at de
tan-yard to wear in winter time; but us foots was tough and us went
barefooted most all de winter too. us played games too, ginerly, jumping
de rope and base.
"de grown niggers had good times sadday nights, wid dances, suppers and
wras'lin. de corn-shuckings was de biggest time dey had, 'cause de
neighbors come and dey laughed and hollered nearly all night.
"old marster and old mistis lived in a big two-story white house. dey
had ten chillun, five boys and five gals, and dey all growed up and
married off. de old carriage-driver was name clark, and he sho' was
proud. de overseer was tetter roberson, and he was mean. he beat niggers
a lot, and bimeby old marster turned him off. he used to blow de horn
way befo' day to git de niggers up, and he work 'em 'tell smack dark.
"atter de yankees burned up everyt'ing 'cept de cabins, us jes' stayed
right dar wid old marster when us freed. old marster built a new house
for him and old mistis, but it wa'n't much better dan our cabin and dey
lived dere 'tell dey died.
"when i growed up, i married laura frazier, and us had a big wedding and
a preacher, and didn't jump over no broom lack some niggers did. us had
jes' two chillun dat lived to be grown. dey is filmore and mary lou, and
us ain't got no gran'chillun.
"when i got grown, i j'ined de baptist church at rough neck, 'cause i
felt i had done enough wrong, and i been a deacon forty year."

john smith
interview with john smith
—susie r. o'brien, uniontown, alabama
john smith is  but he doesn't want to be tied down. "effen i's free,
i wants to 'joy it," john says, and he lives up to his desire. though he
is a "war veter'n" with bullets in his side and leg and his century of
life has enfeebled him, he roams the countryside about uniontown
continually, "settin' a spell" with his acquaintances.
it was only after several trips i finally caught him "settin'," and he
showed no inclination to move from his advantageous position near a
watermelon patch. he was industriously working on a huge slice of melon,
his face buried in the sweet fruit, as i drove up to the little cabin
where he was visiting.
as the car came to a stop he raised his head and wiped his dripping chin
on his sleeve. he called to a little negro girl in the yard, "gal, go
bring de white lady a rockin' cheer", and turning to me he said, "you'll
'scuse me for not gittin' up lak i ain't got no manners, won't you
mistess? i got a misery in my laig; you know de one whar i got shot in
de war."
the rocking chair was brought out and taking a seat nearby i said,
"uncle john, i want you to tell me all about yourself, were you in the
war and are you really a hundred and three years old?"
"glad to, glad to mistess, but fust don't you want a watermillon?" he
pointed to a patch nearby where the melons glistened in the sun. "dis
july sun make de juice so sweet you'll smack yo' mouf for mo'," and
searching the rind to see that he had left none of the juicy red meat,
uncle john began his story.
"well, i been livin' 'roun' dese parts 'bout ninety year. i
was born somewar in north ca'lina, i don't 'member much 'bout my
mammy an' pappy 'cause i was took 'way from dem by de speckerlaters
when i was 'bout thirteen year ole. de speckerlaters raised niggers
to sell. dey would feed 'em up an' git 'em fat and slick and make
money on 'em. i was sold off de block in 'speckerlater's grove' in
north ca'lina. de fus' day i was put up i didn't sold, but de nex'
day i brung a thousand dollars. mr. saddler smith from selma bought
me. dey called him saddler smith cause he was in de saddle business
and made saddles for de army. dey fotch us down on boats. i 'member
de song de men on de boat singed. hit go like dis:
up an' down de mobile ribber,
two speckerlaters for one po' lil nigger.
"my marster was de best in dis country. he didn't had many niggers, but
he sho' tuck good keer o' dem what he did had. he didn't 'low nobody to
hit 'em a lick. sometime when i would git cotch up wid in some diverment
de white folks would say, 'whose nigger is you?" and i say, 'marse
saddler smith.' den dey look at each oder an' say kinder low, 'better
not do nothin' to ole smith's nigger. he'll raise de debil.'
"i didn't had no mistiss. my marster was a widder. he raised me up
workin' 'roun' de saddle shop. i ain't never liked to work nowhow, but
don't tell nobody dat. i was bout twenty seven year ole when de war
broke out. de ole uns was called out fust and de young uns stayed home
and practiced so dey could shoot straight an' kill a yankee. us

'bout. i jes' knowed dey was mad 'bout somepin'. atter while marster's
son jim j'ined de 'federate sogers an' i went wid him for to tote his
knapsack, canteen and sichlike and to look atter him. dat's when i got
dese here balls in my side and got a bullet in my laig, too. i was
movin' de hawses to de back of de lines out de thick of de fight when,
zipp, a minit ball cotch me right in de shoulder."
proudly john displayed the balls in his side and the scar on his leg.
the old woman, at whose cabin john was visiting, interrupted the story
several times. finally he got tired of it and said: "shet yo' mouf
'oman, i don't need no ho'p, dis is grown folks talk, you don't know
nothin' 'bout it, you wasn't even birthed tell two year 'fo' de
surrender. now whar was i at? i slep' right by marsa jim's side.
sometime atter us done laid down and bofe of us be thinkin' 'bout home,
marse jim say, 'john, i lak to have some chicken.' i don't say nothin' i
jes' ease up an' pull my hat down over my eyes an' slip out. atter while
i come back wid a bunch o'chickens crost my shoulder. nex' mornin' marse
jim have nice brown chicken floatin' in graby what i done cook for him.
us was fightin' on blue mountain when marse jim got kilt. i looked and
looked for him but i never did find him. atter i lost my marster i
didn't 'long to nobody and de yankee's was takin' eve'y thing anyhow, so
dey tuck me wid dem.
"i tuck keer of gen'l wilson's hawse, gen'l wilson was de head man in de
yankee army. but i didn't lak dey ways much. he wanted his hawse kep'
spick and span. he would take his white pocket hankercher an' rub over
de hawse and if it was dirty he had me whupped. i was wid gen'l wilson
when he tuck selma 'gins't gen'l forrest and sot fire to all dem things.
i drive de artillery wagon sometime. atter surrender i was kinda puny
wid de balls in my side."
"john," i asked, "why didn't they remove the balls at the time
you were shot?"
"how could dey 'move de balls when i was runnin' fast as i could pick up
my foots? i driv de stagecoach twixt selma and montgomery. i 'member my
stops. dey was selma, benton, lown'esboro and mon'gomery. i driv four
hawses to it. dere was a libbery stable at benton and i changed hawses
dere."
"now john tell me about your wife and children," i said. "how many
children did you have?"
"gawd, i don't know mistess. dey runnin' 'roun' de country like hawgs.
dey don't know me an' i don't know dem. i ain't never been mai'ed.
niggers didn't marry in dem days. i jes' tuk up wid one likely gal atter
anoder. i ain't even mai'ed to de one i got now. i jes' ain't gwine tie
myse'f down. effen i's free, i's gwine to be free."
uncle john sat for a time in deep thought, then said, "i wish i mought
be back in dem days, 'cause i been seed de debil since i been free.
atter i was free i didn't had no marster to 'pend on and i was hongry a
heap of times. i 'long to de 'federate nation and always will 'long to
y'all, but i reckon it's jes' as well we is free 'cause i don't b'lieve
de white folks now days would make good marsters."
uncle john had about talked out and as i rose to leave i said, "thank
you john, this will make a good story," to which he replied indignantly,
"hit ain't no story. hit's de gawd's trufe mistess."
annie stanton
personal interview with "aunt annie" stanton
rylands lane, mobile, alabama
—ila b. prine, mobile, alabama
out on ryland's lane is an old negro woman  years of age who is
totally blind, but whose mind is clear in regards to things pertaining
to the long ago.
"aunt annie" says that things that happened when she was a child are
much more vivid in her mind than are things of today. she said "sumtimes
i now starts tuh do dumpin' an' fogits what i wants tuh do, den i ahs
tuh go bac' tuh de place whar i started from so i kin 'member whats i
started tuh do".
"aunt annie" was born on knight's place on the alabama river, june nd.,
. this place is now known as finchburg, in monroe county, alabama.
her mother's name was mary knight and her father's name was atlas
williams, who had the same name as his owner, mr. offord williams. "aunt
annie's" mother's people were owned first by mr. cullen knight and after
his death, were owned by mr. john marshall.
"aunt annie" was seven years old then the civil war started, and that
she had "nursed two cullered chillun afore de war."
when asked by the writer about nursing these children, so as to be sure
she said colored children, she replied, "dat de slaves lived on de
plantation, and dey had an overseer who libed on dis place, an' she
neber seed de marshall's place 'til after dey was freed. as i growed
bigger into a big yearlin' gal i was tuk intuh de oversee'rs home to
'tend tuh de dinin' room table sich as settin' hit an' washin' de dishes
an' cleanin' up, an' later on i was showed how to iron, spin thread,
weave cloth, and make candles. honey, folks talkin' 'bout depression now
don't kno' nothin' 'bout hard times. in dem days folks didn't hab
nothin' 'ceptin' what dey made. eben if yo' had a mint ob money, dere
was nothin' to buy. we made de candles to burn by tying strings on the
stick and puttin' dem down in melted tallow in moulds. in dem times we
had no matches, folks made fire by strikin' flint rocks together an' de
fire droppin' on cotton. i don't know whether dese rocks were ones dat
de indians lef' or no, but day was dif'rent from other rocks. people
usta carry dem an' de cotton roun' in boxes sumtin lak snuff boxes tuh
keep de cotton dry. sumtimes when dey could'nt get de fire no odder way,
dey would put de cotton in de fireplace and shoot up in dere an' set hit
on fire."
"aunt annie" said she never could start a fire with the flint rock and
cotton, and she said, "de fust matches and lantern i'se eber seed was
when de yankees cum tuh dere place, i th'ot dey was two officers, 'couse
dey had de matches and lantern. two years a'ter i was freed, an' twar
den i seed mah first lamp.
"de men did mos' ob de farm wurk, dey planted cotton, corn, potatoes,
cane, peas and pumpkins, an' dey ginned de cotton by hitching four
horses tuh de gin, and dey run hit dat way."
when asked if they had plenty to eat when they were slaves, "aunt annie"
said:
"lor', yes i guess we had 'nough, but, 'tearn't much, c'ase i 'members
when we was li'l chillun we had a big wooden tray dat dey put de food in
and we all set 'round dat an' et like li'l pigs. de rations for a week
was  lbs of meat a week,  peck ob meal, potatoes an' syrup. at
christmas times de overseer called all de men an' women in an' gib each
woman a dress, a head handkerchief, an' tuh de men he gave a hat, knife,
an' a bottle of whiskey. de overseer also gib tuh us flour and sugar fo'
christmas, an' i 'members one christmas when i was a li'l gal, a'ter de
overseer gib all de women a dress dere was a short piece ob cloth lef'
an' he gib dat tuh me." "aunt annie" said "dat de slaves went tuh de
white folks church, an' sot on de seats on de outside ob de church, an'
dat church was a hewed log building. atter de white folks got thro'
preachin', den de cullered preacher would preach. sumtimes de cullered
folks would hab church when de white folks didn't an' den de slaves
would hab tuh get a pass from his owner, 'ca'se dere would be some mean
folks what would beat de niggers ef dey didn't hab a pass from dere
owners or bosses."
"aunt annie" also said, "i'se neber hyeard of no hoodoo stuff 'til in
late years, dey's mo' ob dat foolishness now dan i'se ebber hyeard of in
mah life. nowadays de hoodoos doctors, what is allus agoin' 'round
foolin' folks out ob dey money, looks lack de dogs might ob and' dem,
dey is so turrible lookin'. i don't believes in dem. us folks a long
time ago neber hab no money fo' dem to git. us had tuh make own
medicine. when de babies had de colic us wud tie soot up in a rag an'
boil it, and den gib dem de water, an' tuh ease de prickly heat us used
cotton wood powdered up fine, and fo' de yellow thrash us would boil de
sheep thrash an' gib em de tea."
"aunt annie" has been married twice, her first husband left her years
ago, when she married louis stanton and had five children by him. louis
was killed in a hailstorm, april , , and all of her children are
dead. she is now being cared for by friends, and she said, "that ef i's
didn't git a li'l he'p from de government tuh gib dis frien'" she didn't
know what she would do as she has been totally blind for two years.

"de years are mighty long widout lottie, massa. she done gone on to de
promise; but i knows she wid jesus. and us gwine 'er walk dem golden
streets together holdin' hands."
uncle theodore fontaine stewart lives alone in a weather-beaten,
one-room eufaula shanty. it is clean and surrounded by flowers. in the
rear is a small garden; and there you will find uncle stewart when the
dawn is fresh or the dusk is coolly approaching.
"lottie been gone away nigh onto twenty-two year now, massa. her was a
good woman; one of de best de lord ever sont to de earth."
he paused to think when the interviewer asked his age.
"it hard fer me to tell 'bout dat," he said, "but i knows i'se well past
de ninety mark. i guess i'se gwine on a hundred, caze i was borned 'fore
de war an' was a right peart boy at de surrender."
"what about slavery times, uncle stewart?"
he mused a moment, his black fingers gently caressing the buttons on his
rust-colored old vest.
"i 'members all 'bout dem times," he said, "an' de lord know dey was
better times den we got now, for white or black. nobody was hongry den,
massa, and peoples didn't git in de devilment dey gits in now. folks

"who was my ol' marster?" he looked at the interviewer a moment,
answered proudly, "why, he was de riches' man in georgy. i knows you has
heard of marse theodore fontaine. he had three big plantations and mo'
niggers dan he could count. he moved clost to florence, an' his three
places was so big you couldn't see 'crost de littlest field.
"ol' marster he lib in a big house, bigger dan any meetin'-house in
eufaula. he had a gang of fine horses, an' when company was dar he had
horse races on his own track. his horses could beat all de horses
brought dar, an' dat's de direc' trufe."
uncle stewart filled a blackened old corncob pipe with tobacco,
continued:
"ol' marster, he didn't go to de war. he too ol' to go, so he stay home
an' make corn an' fodder an' oats an' sen' dem to de soldiers what
killin' yankees. one day de yankees come along an' burnt up everything
on de place, 'cept de nigger cabins. dey took all de horses and
everything us had to eat.
"ol' marster went off somewhar when dey come; i don't 'member where; an'
when he come back he had to live in one of de nigger cabins 'twel he
could build a house. but de new one wasn't big lak de old one.
"my pappy was a fiel' han' 'twel one time ol' marster put him on a horse
to ride in a race, an' pappy beat de other horse so far ol' marster was
tickled pink. he said a nigger what could ride lak dat had no bizness in
de fiel', so he made a stable boy outen pappy.
theodore fontaine stewart, eufaula, alabama
"ol' marster didn't have no ol' mistus. he say he so big all de little
ladies look funny 'side of him. when company was dar his sisters, mistus
mary an' mistus lucy, come an' kep' house; but dey lef' when de company

"my pappy was name ed stewart, caze ol' marster buy him from a stewart.
atter de war dey call pappy's chilluns stewart; but us is fontaines by
right, bet yo' life on dat.
"ol' marster was good to de niggers, but his overseers was mean.
ol' marster fired dem atter awhile an' got some good overseers. he
didn't 'low dem to whip a nigger 'cept when he say, an' he didn't say
so much.
"my mammy was name' sarah, an' her an' pappy stayed right wid ol'
marster when de surrender come. dey was right in de room when ol'
marster died, an' dey cried something awful. us all stayed dar 'twel
pappy an' mammy die; den us chilluns split up an' went everywhere.
"mammy an' pappy had ten head o' chilluns sides me, but i don' know whar

george strickland
interview with george strickland
—preston klein, opelika, alabama
george strickland, alert for all his ninety-one years but blinking in
the bright sunlight as he laid his battered felt hat beside the rocking
chair in front of his cabin in opelika, alabama, as he looked back down
the decades and remembered the times when "cornshuckin' was de greates'
thing." though only a boy when the war between the states ended, he
recalled days of slavery easily as he told the following story.
"i was nine years old when us niggers was sot free an' 'fo' dat time us
refugeed from mississippi to mobile, den to selma, den to montgomery an'
from dar to uchie, near columbus, georgia, whar we stayed 'til us was
freed.
"my mammy an' daddy come from mississippi fust. dey was cleveland an'
eve strickland an' dar was fo' of us chilluns, will, sam, missouri an'
me. us quarters had dirt flo's an' was in two long rows wid a street
between. on de east side of de settlement was de barns, shops an' sich
like. de beds was boxed up an' nailed to de wall, den dey was filled wid
pinestraw. dey fed us li'l niggers in wood troughs made of poplar. de
cook in de big house cooked pots of greens an' po'd potlikker an' all in
de troughs. us et hit wid mussel shells or wid usses han's or gourds.
our wimmin folks would bile de gourds to keep dem from being bitter.
usses had two acre paster dat usses would turn under in de fall an'
plant hit in turnips. i 'clare fo' goodness dey growed nearly as big as
a gallon bucket.
"dey gived us clo'es ev'y saddy night an' de winter clo'es had some cow
hair in dem to make 'em warm.
"ol' marsa john strickland was circuit preacher an' him an' miss polly
lived up in a big log house. de logs was hewed an' split an' lined on
each side. de logs stood on dey sides an' didn' lay flat. dey chilluns
was mary, laura, sallie, wiley, george an' lougene.
"when ol' marsa went off to preach, de overseer was mean an' whupped de
niggers so bad mistis runned him off. dey had 'bout a hundred slaves an'
would wake dem up by beating on a big piece of sheet ine (iron) wid a
long piece of steel.
"de well didn' hab no windless but had a lever wid a bucket fastened on
one end of hit, an' we would hold to de yuther end to dip de bucket in
de water.
"when dey whupped de niggers dey would tie dem to a tree an' whup dem
good. when dey was sold dey would put 'em on a stand or block, as dey
called hit den, an' dey w'ud roll up dey sleeves to see de muscles. den
dey bid on dem an' bought 'em for 'bout $, to $, apiece. us
traveled in ox carts, an' i fust rid on a stage when i went to uchie.
when slaves would be ver' bad dey would chain dem out all night. you
sho' had to stay at home an' wuk.
"our chu'ch was nearby an' us sot nex' to de do'. mistis called up all
de li'l niggers, talked to dem an' had pra'r. de yuthers had pra'r
meetin' oncet a week.
"de wimmin folks had a big time quiltin's wid somebody aplayin' on ol'
gourds wid horse hair strings, called old gourd, horse hair dance.
"cornshuckin' was de greates' thing of all. ol' marsa tuck a jug of
likker 'roun' an' got dem tight an' when dey got full dey would h'ist
him up an' down, tote him 'roun' an' holler. den de fun started an' dey
would play de old gourd an' horse hair dance, de han'saw an' case knife.
dey could run dey han' up an' down de saw to change de tune an' de
leader was on top of de pile of corn singin' whilst all de yuthers
would follow.
"us chilluns was 'sleep den, but us had our good times hidin' de switch
an' playin' han'-over ball. dey sho' skeer us nearly into fits wid tales
of rawhead and bloody-bones.
"i'se never tuk a oath ner teched nothin' didn' b'long to me in all my
life.
"our med'cin' was jerus'lem oak seed what was beat up to give de
chilluns for worms.
"on sund' mornin' dey giv' us biskits for breakfast, which was so rar'
dat we would try to beat de yuthers outten dey'n.
"oncet dey piled ev'ythin' on waggins an' put all us li'l niggers on
top. us rations, lak coffee, meal, meat an' mos' ev'ythin' was kivvered
over wid sheets. den dey tuk us off an' us stayed t'ree days an' nights.
"ol' marsa tuk one of de fellers wid him to be on de front line to help
keep off de injuns, so us chilluns b'lieves.
george strickland, opelika, alabama
"dat battle of atlanta was de wust thing dat's ever been. all de houses
for a fur piece jes' shuck from de big guns. de yankees camped in a big
hundred acre fiel' close by. den dey rushed up to de house, kicked de
gate down, tuk mistiss trunk out an' bus' hit open huntin' money. but
dey foun' none, so dey sot fire to de house an' ast, whar de horses? de
niggers couldn' tell an' den dey burnt de house down.
"atter dat, ol' marsa tell us, us is free from him but needn't leave
iffen us didn' want to go, but could stay on wid him an' he'd treat us
right an' give us half of what us made.
"in after years i ma'ed josephine bedell an' us had george, phillip,
renza, eldridge (de baby), may willie an' leila. i's got some
gran-chillun, too, but kain't think of dey names.
"hit was de plans of god to free us niggers an' not abraham lincoln's.
"i's allus tried to live under de correction of de lord. hit's my duty
to try to do so."
cull taylor
personal interview with cull taylor
 n. scott street, mobile, alabama
—ila b. prine, mobile, alabama
a tall, stoop-shouldered, black negro man came trudging down the road
with a hoe in his hand. asked where cull taylor lived, the old man said,
"lady i'se cull taylor. dis is mah house here. does you want to see me?"
when told that his visitor was looking for old people who lived during
slavery days cull said:
"i were born a slave, but warn't very old when de niggers was freed. i
were born march , , in augusta county, alabama. mah maw come from
richmond, virginia and her name were jane hare. mah paw's name were
willingham hare, and he were brought to alabama from north carolina. i
guess you'se wonderin' why mah name is taylor when mah maws and paws
name was hare?
"you see when dey was fust brought here, a man name tom taylor bought
'em, an' when i were born, dey gib me to miss bennie taylor. ol' marse
tom's girl. miss bennie gib me de name taylor an' i'se allus kept hit.
she shorely was good to me. i neber had nothing much to do, i stayed wid
her, 'til i was grown, atter she married mr. bob alexander.
"'bout de war, i does 'member how mah maw was a-weavin' cloth when de
yankees come through. an' atter de niggers was freed ol' marse tom gib
mah maw de loom.
"ol' marse was a good man. he neber 'lowed no o'seer or anybody to
mistreat his niggers. he had plenty of 'em, too, and a big plantation
wid plenty to eat. course de slaves had to work on de plantation an'
raise de stuff to eat. his house was a big fine, white place, an' de
cabins whar de slaves libed was built in rows, wid streets between dem,
so you could drive 'tween 'em wid big double team wagons. de cabins was
built out ob logs wid a notch out in de shoulders, an' laid on top ob
one another an' when dey built de wall up as high as dey wanted hit, dey
would bore a augor hole an' put a pin in hit to hold 'em together. den
dey put de roof on. dey filled de cracks between de logs wid mortar, so
as to keep de wind out, an' it sho' made de houses warm. us had jes'
wooden home-made beds, wid mattresses made of cotton, or moss, an'
sometimes hay. us neber hab no springs on de beds.
"as i said, ol' marse tom was a good man, an' he was too old to go to de
war, but he had two boys. de oldest one went to de war an' was killed.
but de youngest warn't old enough to go. ol' marse tom had de women sew,
makin' clothes, an' had nurse women to look atter de little niggers
while dere maws was in de fields. i 'members as a li'l boy how dey had
one house whar de nurse kept de chillun an' it was as clean as a pin.
dere was wooden troughs different heights for de different age chillun,
an' dose troughs was scrubbed as white as cotton mos'. when meal time
come, dey would crumble up cornbread wid pot licker, or milk an' gib to
de youngest ones. an' dey had plenty ob milk, i 'members de big milk
dairy, an' smoke house on de place, an' when de yankees come through dey
went into de dairy an' drank all de milk dey wanted.
"i 'members mah paw was out in de woods hidin' de mules when dey come
through an' dere was only one old horse on de place. dem yankees turn
hit loose, but otherwise dey behaved very nice."
cull said that they didn't know anything about dishes and spoons such as
are used now, for they had wooden spoons for the slaves. he said that
the usual rations for a week included a peck of meal, and six or seven
pounds of meat to each man, and if he had a big family he was given
more. they raised rice, sugar cane, pumpkins, watermelons, cushaws,
peaches, pears, plums and grapes.
"mah white folks not only tuk keer ob us durin' slavery times, but dey
gib us things atter us was freed. you ax me 'bout de slaves clothes?
yas'm, lady, us had good, stout, clothes, made out ob de cloth dat de
women wove. i can see mah maw throwing dat ol' shickle from one side to
de other, weaving cloth on dat loom. dey dyed de cloth wid red oaks an'
dogwood bark, and chinaberry bark, and had all kinds ob colors, sich as
blue, red, brown, and black.
"den dere was de big times, sich as de hog killin' time, an' corn
shucking, an' 'specially cotton pickin' time. sometimes de neighboring
plantation would hab a regular cotton pickin' festival, an' all ob us
would go and he'p pick de cotton, and de nigger what would pick de mos'
would git a dress or de men would git a suit ob clothes. de suits was
made out ob osnaburg, and sometimes bed tickin'. when a big crowd would
come to dese cotton pickin's, dey would pick out three or four bales ob
cotton.
"de li'l niggers had a good time playin' in de sand makin' frog houses,
an' spinnin' tops. but, lordy! when us got sick, dey gib us jerusalem
oak and sassafras tea. but neber was dere anything said 'bout hoo-doo
stuf. i never heard ob hit, 'til dese later years.
"but us did hab church, an' prayer meetin', an' funerals! lor', yes, dey
don't bury folks now. in dose days dey started singin' at de house an'
sung all de way to de graveyard; an' den dey put dem in de groun' good
full six feet deep, dey jes' lays folks on top ob de groun' now-a-days.
but times is different now, lady.
"i 'members how de men would go out nights an' hunt de possums an' de
coons, and wild cats. dey den would sometimes go deer an' rabbit huntin'
in de daytime; an', too, dey would set traps to ketch other varmints.
dere was plenty ob squirrels too.
"but let me tell you, de bes' thing ob all, was de good locust beer, dey
made from locust seeds. dey also made 'simmon beer, an' wine out ob
plums. dem war good days den."
daniel taylor
interview with daniel taylor
montgomery, alabama
—john proctor mills, montgomery, alabama
foreword:—in uncle daniel taylor we find the unusual, fast disappearing
type of negro ex-slave (it makes the sentimental white man feel a deep
sadness in the passing of these gentle old souls, whose lives have been
well spent in serving to the best of their ability.) uncle dan is a
light complected mulatto (octoroon) with a high and broad forehead (a
noble brow) devoid of all negroid features, a heavy suit of silk-like
hair almost free of any kinks, a heavy suit of gray beard (it is in the
short kinky hair next to his throat that the negro stands out most
prominently) a fine moustache which matches the snowy silkiness of his
hair up on his head. deep set, dark blue-grey eyes which beam with
kindliness, wide apart and far-searching. a voice well modulated and
refined in timbre, of tenor quality. uncle dan has been so closely
associated with the educated white man of the south until he uses no
negro dialect, but his speech is that of one who has tried at all times
to speak correctly and deliberately. he has served as janitor at nearly
all of the public schools of the montgomery city schools system, and for
fifteen years or more has been at the baldwin high school; is janitor at
this school at present (may ) where he is highly respected, and
greatly beloved by the student body and members of the large faculty.
"strange to say, i do not remember the name of my first master, nor of
the second master to whom my mother and myself were sold to in alabama.
i was born at charleston, south carolina, and at the age of two and a
half years we landed at luverne, ala., where with my mother i was sold
for four-hundred dollars.
"i was fourteen years old at the time of the 'surrender,' and was living
at old 'rocky mount' in crenshaw county, at the time of the 'civil war.'
professor mack barnes of highland home, alabama, was the first man i
ever worked for, and he, as you know, was at the head of the large
school located in highland home.
"the hottest moments of my life were the ones in which my mother got
tight in behind me with a hickory (switch) and i always took to the
woods. i'll just bet that i knew and could tell more about the woods and
the cane-brake than anyone in that section. yes sir! i knew every
varmint that crawled on its belly, and all the rest which went on four
feet, that lived there. believe me, i knew every one of them by name and
right where they stayed.
"the hot moments just mentioned usually found me 'cooling off' in the
creek in the old swimmin' hole.
daniel taylor, montgomery, alabama
"among the thrilling moments of my life well do i remember the visits of
president jefferson davis, (the first and only president of the
confederate states of america) to the home of my master. mr. davis
always gave me a quarter of a dollar for holding his horse, and up 'til
lately i had one of those quarters as a highly valued keep-sake, but it
suddenly disappeared, i know not where.
"the most exciting moments of my whole life was when the herron street
school (at present the cottage hill school) caught fire and burned to
the ground. we had marched all of the children out of the building to
safety (you see we had all had disciplined fire drills) but professor
charles l. floyd (superintendent of the montgomery public schools) was
mindful lest there should still be one person left in the building, so
hastened back into the rapidly burning building. he just wouldn't listen
to the pleadings of miss jinny (miss virginia hereford, who was the
principal of this school) nor to miss sophy (miss sophia holmes) a
teacher at the primary department, nor would he listen to my humble
plea. the roof was already tumbling in, and the blazing rafters were
falling in every direction. i could stand it no longer, so rushed right
through the smoke and flames, finally i found mr. floyd and dragged him
out to safety. my god! i loved that white man, he was one of the finest
men i ever knew!
"no! mister john, i have never sought a 'heroe's medal for bravery and
for risking my life', my one great reward was in the saving of the life
of my true friend professor charles l. floyd."
george taylor
personal interview with george taylor
 south hamilton street, mobile, alabama
—ila b. prine, mobile, alabama
george taylor, an old and very black man, who lives at  south
hamilton street in mobile, says he is an ex-slave. he knows that he was
born in mobile on the corner of cedar and texas streets, but left
mobile, and was carried to gosport, alabama, when he was twelve years
old. his father's name was gus taylor and his mother's sarah taylor, and
they were owned by mr. w.g. herrin. there were twenty-one children in
george's family, and he said he was the oldest one, and helped "nuss de
odders."
"mah grandfather's name was mac wilson an' mah grandmother's name was
ellen wilson, an' de ol' miss's name was miss mamie herrin. all de
colored folks' chillun called mr. herrin 'cl' marster, an' he sho' was a
good marster, too. i 'members dat atter i got to be a big boy dey put me
in de fiel's choppin' cotton, but i neber could pick cotton. i knows dat
mah paw said i was too crazy 'bout de girls, so he tuk me an' made me
plow.
"ol' marster had a big place, i don't jes' exactly knows how many acres
dey was, but i knows us had plenty ob cotton, 'ca'se sometimes dey would
pick four or five bales a day. an' den i knows durin' cotton time mah
paw hauled cotton all day long to de gin whut was run by five or six
mules.
"durin' de busy season on de plantation ol' marster had de older women
cookin' an' sendin' de dinner to de fiel'. dere was two big baskets, one
to put de bread in, an' de odder basket to put de meat in. every mornin'
at three o'clock de women begun cookin' an' each han' brought his own
meat an' bread to this cabin to be cooked. every person's plate had
their names on 'em. ever'body had to be up by daylight an' ready to
begin work. de men had to get up before daylight an' begin to harness
de mules, an' soon as light dey was in de fiel's. dere was two hundred
and fifty head ob colored people, 'scusing chillun. dey would raise
four, five, and six hundred bales ob cotton, a year. us worked den, dere
warn't no walkin' 'bout den, not eben on sat'day atternoons, but i
believes i'd lack it betta dan i does now, 'cause de chillun was taught
to be mannerable den, but now dey cuss if you say anything to dem.
"us had a good place to stay, de ol' marster's house was a big two-story
house, an' our cabins was built ob boards an' was in a row. us didn't
hab no stoves, jes' cooked out in de yard ober a fire wid stakes on each
side of hit, wid an' iron bar across 'em to hang de pots on. ol' marster
rationed out de food, an' each man was 'lowed seven pounds ob meat, de
women was 'lowed six pounds an' five pounds for each child. den dey gib
us a peck ob meal, five pounds of flour and some molasses.
"i neber did eat at home wid mah folks, 'ca'se i nussed in de big house,
an' ebery time dat de white chillun eat, i had to eat, too. dere was
plenty ob pecan, walnut, an' ches'nut trees on de place, an' us could
eat all de nuts we wanted; and den de slaves had dere own gardens if dey
wanted to.
"den i 'members how dere was four men who put de hogs in de pens to
fatten, sometimes, dey would put as many as a hundred or a hundred an'
fifty at a time. den hit was dere duty to tote feed from de fiel's to
feed 'em.
"my! when i think ob dat big smoke house, mah mouth jes' waters. at hog
killin' time, dere was certain men to kill, an' certain ones to cut 'em
up. dere warn't neber no special time to hog killin', jes' when de ol'
marster said do hit, we did hit.
"you see us was allus under his direction, 'ca'se if us wanted to go
anywhere, us had to git a pass, eben to church. de white folks had
methodist church, an' de collored had de baptist church.
"i also 'members de time i was put up on de block to be sold, an' when
de man only offered five hundred dollars, fer me, an' ol' marster tole
me to git down, dat i was de mos' valuable nigger he had, 'ca'se i was
so strong, an' could do so muck work.
"mah maw was de weaver, an' dere was a woman named assella who did de
dyeing. mah paw gathered de bark, sich as red oak, elm, maple and
juniper bark, an' dry hit an' den grin' hit up. dey also used borax,
alum and blue stone, to set de dye. de women made de clothes out ob dis
cloth dat was woven on de place.
"you axed 'bout weddin's. us didn't hab weddin's lack us do now. de way
us married would be to go to de big house, an' ol' marster had us to
jump over a broom stick, an' den us was considered married. but dere was
one thing dat us warn't 'lowed to do, an' dat was to abuse or cuss our
wives, an' you betta not strike 'em, ca'se hit would be jes' too bad.
"you know, miss, i'se been here a long time. i 'members when dere was
only one house 'tween st. louis street an' frascati, an' dat was de
guard house. i also 'members de ole time remedies dat dey used in de ole
days. dey used red oak bark for fever an' colds, an' den dere was
hoarhound, an' black snake root dat de ol' marster put whiskey on. ol'
marster made his own whiskey. an' oh! yes, de calomus root growed in de
woods whar dey lived. i neber seed dem send to no store for medicine. i
neber hyeard ob no hoodoo stuff, 'till i was grown, an' anudder thing
folks didn't die of lack dey do now. when any one did die, dey allus had
a big funeral, an' de men would sometimes hitch up a ox team or mule
teams, an' as many as could git in would go. de coffins was home made
an' stained. dere was plenty ob han's to dig de graves, too.
"i'se tell you, miss, folks is pretty much de same, if de white folks
treat de niggers right, you couldn't get dem to leave dem. i 'members
when de yankees come through, i was standin' on de ol' marster's porch,
an' i seed dem comming, an' marster got up on his crutch an' go to de
steps an' invite dem in, an' believe me dey come in, too. dey jes'
natcherly tore up ol' marster's place; then de furniture all 'roun' an'
broke heaps ob hit. i knows b'fore dey got dere ol' marster had mah paw,
an' jerry lee, an' mace pouncey, an' anudder man take four barrels ob
money an' carry down to de spring an' put hit in de spring, an' i'se
tellin' you, miss, you couldn't any more git near dat spring, dan
nothin', ca'se de quicksan' made dem barrels boil up, one at a time, an'
de way dey had to git dem barrels, was to buil' a scaffold from de
river, an' let a line down an' ketch aroun' dem barrels.
"atter we was freed, ol' marster come out in de yard an' got in de
middle ob all ob us, an' tole us dat de ones dat wants to stay wid him,
to stan' on one side, an' de odders to stan' on de odder side. so mah
paw got on de side wid dose who wanted to leave, an' us lef' ol' marster
an' paddled down de river, in a paddlin' boat to belle's landing.
"as i'se said before, i'se been here a long time, i eben 'members seeing
jeff davis. i knows i ain't here for long, but i'se ready, 'ca'se i'se
been fightin' for jesus twenty-nine years, an' i ain't tired ob fightin'
yet. i'se a deacon in de baptist church."
amanda tellis
personal interview with amanda tellis
and her daughter sarah chastan
in allenville, mobile county, alabama
—written by ila b. prine
amanda tellis, a tall, thin, light lulatto woman, who was born a slave
november , , lives in allenville, a negro settlement about four
miles north of mobile, alabama.
amanda's father was a spaniard, whose name was john quick, and her
mother's name was sallie pugh, her mother having the same name as the
people who owned her. sallie, amanda's mother, was born a slave in
charleston south carolina, and she and her mother were brought to
alabama and sold when sallie was twelve years old. the mother was sold
to someone in demopolis, alabama, while sallie was sold to the pugh
family in grove hill, alabama.
amanda was born in grove hill, alabama and mr. meredith pugh was her
master, and mrs. fannie pugh was her mistress. her young "missus" was
miss maria pugh, a daughter, one of seven children in the pugh family.
amanda said she willed to "miss maria" and she nursed and took care of
her until the surrender. many times when amanda would be promised a
whipping for not doing things as she should have, miss maria would save
her from the whipping, by throwing herself back from the table and
screaming for them not to touch amanda, her nurse.
aside from caring for "miss maria", amanda said she spun three cuts of
thread a day, and when the writer asked what a cut was, she said: "a cut
was a broach full." during the war, (meaning the civil war,) amanda said
she and her sister nancy spun  yards of cloth, and they finished the
last on the day of the surrender, when the cannons were fired at fort
morgan, and they were mustering the men out.
amanda's life was a very easy one in comparison to some of the other
slaves. she said she had seen many of the slaves cruelly mistreated, but
her people were fortunate in having a good master and mistress.
however, at the close of the war, amanda was told to pretend she had a
chill, and go to her mother's cabin, so she did as she was told. when
she reached the cabin, her mother, brothers and sisters each had a
pillow slip, filled with clothes and she was given hers and they ran
away, and came to mt. vernon, alabama. amanda was only eleven years old
then.
her life has been varied since, having married three times. her first
husband was scott johnson, and was the father of all of her children,
seven boys and one girl. amanda lives with this girl now. her second
husband was vance stokes, and her third was s.t. tellis, a negro
methodist preacher. amanda said he was "no count and i did not stay with
him long."
amanda is now confined to her bed and has been for the past seven weeks,
her body has wasted away, until she is skin and bones. her eyes however
are still bright and keen, her hair snow white and she still has a few
teeth. her mind seems to be clear, and her memory good, in fact the past
is now a part of her, and she told the writer she was so happy because
she had come to ask her about it, before it was too late.
ellen thomas
interview with ellen thomas
—mary a. poole, mobile
in a little cottage at  wienacker avenue, in the western part of
mobile, lives ellen thomas, who claims to be  years old. she is small
of stature, dark brown in color, with high cheek bones and small regular
features. although she wears the old-fashioned bandana handkerchief
bound about her head, the story of 'aunt' ellen is unusual, in that
having been raised as a house servant in a cultured southern family, she
absorbed or was trained in the use of correct speech, and does not
employ the dialect common to negroes of the slavery days.
'aunt' ellen was born in mobile. her mother, emeline, was a dwarf who
was brought from st. louis to mobile by a slave-trader. when put up for
sale, her deformity enlisted the sympathy of judge f.g. kimball, who
bought her and brought her to his home on dauphin street, between
hallett street and georgia avenue. later, sam brown, a free negro from
the west indies, came to mobile and, wanting emeline for his wife,
agreed to pay judge kimball for her, giving himself as security. sam and
emeline had only two children, pedro and ellen, both born on judge
kimball's place and raised in his home as house servants, having little
contact with the field slaves.
in her childhood, ellen had as her special mistress miss cornelia, one
of the kimball girls, who trained her in the arts of good housekeeping,
including fine sewing, which was itself an art among the women of that
period. ellen relates with much pride, her ability to put in tucks and
back-stitch them in the front of men's shirts, to equal the best machine
work of the present day. although hampered by failing eyesight in recent
years, her work with the needle today is proof that her claims are not
exaggerated.
in all her experience as a slave, she recalls but one whipping. this was
with a small switch in the hands of judge kimball. the cause? she
answered: "i ain't coming," when he called her; and at his second call,
she said: "i shan't do it." she was seven years old at the time.
judge kimball insisted that the house servants use good english, she
said. thus brought up as a child among the kimball children, and because
of her duties as a house servant, she mingled little with the field
hands and acquired none of their dialect. even her long association with
free negroes since the war, has failed to eradicate early impressions
and practices in the use of words, and she stresses this in conversation
with educated white persons.
because she was a house servant, ellen was accorded many privileges not
enjoyed by ordinary slaves. good food, neat clothing and cleanliness of
person were requirements rigidly enforced. as personal maid to young
girls little older than herself, her lot was quiet and the association
developed a devotion and friendship that was lifelong. among the
privileges that fell to her as a child, she recalls that of accompanying
the family on carriage rides—usually seated beside the driver to the
envy of her little mistress on the more dignified inside seat.
ellen thomas, mobile, alabama
her training as a house servant was very broad and involved every
feature of a well kept household of that period. she has especial pride
in her ability to serve at table, particularly when there were guests
present. a feature of the training given her and which ellen says she
never knew of anyone else receiving was, after being taught to set the
dining table complete for guests, she would be blindfolded and then told
to go through the motions of serving and so learn to do so without
disturbing anything on the table. so proficient did she become in
serving, that a few times when they had guests, judge kimball would for
their amusement have ellen blindfolded and direct her to serve the
dinner. in passing dishes a small silver tray was used.
ellen said that they tried to teach her brother pedro to serve the table
likewise; but his natural clumsiness prevented. he could never learn.
during the war, she said, her master had an immense pit dug near the
house, put his cotton in the pit and built the woodpile over it. the
federal invaders never found it.
judge kimball owned extensive tracts of land above mobile and used a
large number of his slaves to cut timber for wood and lumber; hewn
timber being largely used for house-building. he built a house for every
one of his children, from his own timber, and even had his own coffin
made from home-grown cedar. ellen failed to follow this act of her
master with approval, judging from her tone in speaking of it.
she remembers the surrender and the incidents accompanying that event.
she was seventeen years old. thus she describes the first visit
afterward of the enemy. "i was helping to cook breakfast one morning,
frying codfish and potatoes, when i heard a drum and ran to tell master.
he jumped up and said: 'it's the yankees! tell pedro to get a sheet and
hang it out in front.' pedro was excited and, instead of getting a
sheet, got one of mistress' best table cloths and hung it from a big oak
tree near the front gate. when the yankees rode up, they dismounted and
master invited them in for breakfast."
one of the yankee lieutenants asked her name, and she told him: "ellen
brown." he looked puzzled at her answer, knowing her master's name to be
kimball. (since her father was a free man, 'aunt' ellen said that she
and her brother, pedro, always retained their own name, instead of
"kimball.") the lieutenant then said: "all right, ellen, bring me a
glass of milk at thirteen o'clock."
she went to her little mistress, and asked her "what that old lieutenant
meant by 'thirteen o'clock.'" miss cornelia laughed and said he meant
"one o'clock."
'aunt' ellen related how judge kimball was always teaching them and gave
them regular lectures. she particularly remembers one of his sayings:
"you can never swing on yellow pine tree, as it is tender and pliable."
she remained with the kimballs three years after the war, worked for
other families a short time and then married amos thomas when she was
about twenty years old. they had a very large family, eleven girls and
nine boys. she now has great-grandchildren who are married.
although there is little doubt that her age is approximately what she
claims, 'aunt' ellen is remarkably well preserved, physically and
mentally. her activity and industry would not be inappropriate to a
woman a score of years younger. unlike many persons of her years she
does not constantly look forward to her time of departure, but takes
life as it comes—caring more for today than for tomorrow.
elizabeth thomas
interview with elizabeth thomas
—montgomery
elizabeth thomas who lives at  eugene street, montgomery, alabama stuck
up one finger when asked her age. that meant  she said. she is
typical the oldtime negro with head rag tightly covering her hair,
carrying a slick old walking-stick whose bark is worn in places because
of constant use, and little old straightcut full apron. her memory is
not clear but her hearing is perfect.
she stated—
"i lived mighty fine in dem days, i tel' you. mister ben martin jones
was my marster, and i was born on de red bridge road. i was a house
servant. all our clo'es was made at de quarters. my mammy made mine an'
all i wanted, too. i useter hear my mammy say, de patteroles (patrols)
would git us ef we done wrong but i didn't know nothin' 'bout
patteroles, 'cause dey wasn't none on our place. dey whipped you, too,
but my marster could control all his niggers so he didn't 'low none uv
'em on our place.
"i was  years ole when de yankees come but i didn't run and dey didn't
do nuthin' to me but folks was in such a hurry they hid things dat ain't
never been foun' yet. i liked meetin' on sundays an' sometime we never
got outer church tell daylight. i wants to live jes' as long as jesus
say an' when he say go, i'se ready. at christmas times we always had
good dinners and heap o' company; plenty uv it. my missus died and atter
dat my mother raised ole marster's chile, tommy john, right 'long wid
me. o, dem was happy days, i tell you."
mollie tillman
interview with mollie tillman
—susie r. o'brien, uniontown, alabama
aunt mollie tillman was fifteen years old when the southern slaves were
freed; but despite her advanced age, she is able to work every day in
the cotton fields and admits that she is "purty peart."
she said, "honey, i kin ricolleck all 'bout slavery time, 'caze i was a
big ol' gal den. why, i 'members when de 'mancipation come as if 't'was
yestidy."
aunt mollie recalls that she was born on a plantation near rome,
georgia, and that her owners were dan and lucy phillips.
"marse dan was a baptis' preacher," she explained, "an' he shorely was a
good man. he was a chaplain in de big war and he didn't get hurt.
"marster owned lots an' lots of slaves an' de plantation was jes' full
o' niggers. he was a powerful important man.
"honey, i warn't no common eve'yday slave, i ho'ped de white folks in de
big house. mistus lucy wouldn't let 'em take me to de fiel'. dem was
good days, chile; might good days. i was happy den, but since
'mancipation i has jes' had to scuffle an' work an' do de bes' i kin."
aunt mollie's hair is snow white in sharp contrast to her ginger-cake
skin.
"i 'members all 'bout when de yankees come," she said. "dey was jes'
ruineration to de plantation. dey tuck all de mules an' cows, den sont
out an' got all de chickens an' eggs dey could fin'. eatin' was kind o'
slack wid us atter dey lef'."
aunt mollie's life has known romance. let her tell it:
"i was ol' 'nough to be castin' my eyes 'roun' at de young bucks, an'
dere was a nigger what lived on de plantation jinin' our'n whut tuck a
shine to me. i lacked dat boy fine, too.
"he would come over to see me ever' time he git a chanct. one night he
'low he gwine'r ax his marster to buy me so's me an' him could git
married. well, atter dat he didn' come no mo'.
"i waited an' i watched, but i didn' hear nuffin of dat nigger. atter
'while i got worried. i was 'fraid de patterollers done kotch him, or
maybe he done foun' some gal he lak better dan he do me. so i begin to
'quire 'bout him an' foun' dat his marster done sol' him to a white man
whut tuck him 'way down yonder to alabama.
"well ma'am, i grieved fo' dat nigger so dat my heart was heavy in my
breas'. i knowed i never would see him no mo'. soon atter dat, peace was
'clared an' de niggers was free to go whar dey pleased.
"my folks stayed on wid marse dan fer a year; den dey 'cided to go to
alabama an' farm. we hit it off to alabama an' i begin to go 'bout some
wid de young bucks. but somehow i couldn't git my min' off dat other
nigger.
"well ma'am, one day at a big meetin' i runned up on him. i was so happy
i shouted all over dat meetin' house. we jes' tuck up whar we lef' off
an' 'fo' long us got married."
and, aunt mollie continued, they lived happily until his death about 
years ago.
she now lives in uniontown, happy and contented. she has her garden and
flowers; but emphasizes that "de ol' days was de bes' of all."

william henry towns
interview with william henry towns
—levi d. shelby, jr., tuscumbia, alabama
"it's been so long sence, i don' 'member much," william henry (bill)
towns said talking of slavery days. towns was only seven when the civil
war began and his memories are those of childhood, which he mixes with
reminiscences and opinions of the older slaves with whom he came in
contact immediately after the war. towns knows the exact date of his
birth. he says:
"i was born in tuscumbia, alabama, december , . my mother was name
jane smoots. she come from baltimore, maryland. my father's name was joe
towns, and he come from huntsville, alabama.
"i had a passel of brudders an' sisters; charlie and bob was my
brudders; betty, kate, lula an' nelie was my sisters. dere wasn't but
two of us endurin' slavery. dat was me an' nelie; de rest was born atter
slavery. me an' nelie was townses, the rest, charlie, kate, lula, bob
and betty was joneses. how dat come 'bout was dis away. endurin' slavery
my father was sold to anudder slave owner. atter de war my mother
married frank jones; den dese yuther chillun was born.
"it done been so long sence all of dis was i disremembers most 'bout it.
anyway, the big house was a two-story house; white like mos' houses
endurin' dat time. on the north side of the big house set a great, big
barn, where all de stock an' stuff dat was raised was kep'. off to de
southwes' of de barn an' wes' of de big house set 'bout five or six log
houses. these house was built facin' a space of ground in de center of a
squa'e what de houses made. anybody could stan' in his front do' an' see
in at the front of de yuther houses.
"sometimes enduring' de week an' on sunday, too, de people would git
together out in dis squa'e an' talk 'fore goin' to bed. the chillun what
was too young to work was always out in de front playin'. jes' acrost
from our place was anudder wid de quarters built 'mos' de same as ourn
'ceptin' dat dey had a picket fence 'roun' de quarters to pervent 'em
from runnin' away. 'course mr. young didn't have to worry 'bout his
han's runnin' away, cause he wan't a mean man like some of de slave
holders was. he never spoke harsh or whupped 'em, an' he didn't 'low
nobody else to do it neither.
"i remember one day a fellow come from acrost on anudder farm an' spoke
sumpin' 'bout mr. young bein' too easy wid his servants. he said, 'them
darn niggers will think they is good as you iffen you keep up de rate
you goin' now, young.' mr. young just up an' told him if he ever spoke
like dat again he'd call his bluff. mr. young told him de he didn't work
his people like dey was oxes.
"all of mr. young's hands liked him 'cause he didn't make 'em sleep on
corn shuck mattresses an' he didn't have dey meals cooked in a wash pot.
a lot of de yuther slaves didn't know what it was to eat meat, lessen it
was a holiday. mr. young 'lowed his people to eat just what he eat. i
hear my mother tell a tale 'bout a man what took a meat skin an' whipped
his chillun's mouth wid it to fool folks like dey had some meat for
dinner. ole caleb told one a lil' bit bigger'n dat, though. he said one
night him an' a feller was comin' from prayer meeting an' they runned
'crost a possum settin' in de root of a tree by de side of de road. he
say he stopped to git him an' dis yuther feller told him he wouldn't
bother wid him 'cause he wouldn't git none of him no how. caleb ast him
why he said that. he said, ''cause your ole master is gwine take him
jes' soon as you git home wid him.' caleb told him dat mr. young wasn't
dat kin'er man. de yuther feller ho'ped caleb to ketch dat possum, an'
he got a piece of him de nex' night when ever'body come in from de
fiel'. caleb said de ol' feller enj'yed de meat so much dat he wished he
took him an' his family de 'hole possum.
"we didn't live so far from big spring creek. 'co'se, we didn't do no
fishin', 'cause we younguns had to 'tend gaps to keep de cattle off'n de
crops. de grownups had to go to de fiel'. life was kin'er happy durin'
slavery 'cause we never knowed nothing 'bout any yuther sort of life or
freedom. all we knowed was work from one en' of de year to de yuther,
'ceptin' on holidays. den we'd have to go to church or set around de
fire an' lis'en to de old folks tell stories. the grownups would go to a
dance or do sumpin' else for indertainment. co'se us younguns got a heap
of pleasure outten dem fairy tales dat was tol' us by de older ones. i
know ma an' dem use to tell some of de awf'lest tales sometimes. i'd be
'fraid to go from one part of de house to de yuther widoutten somebody
wid me. us younguns would had to play some sort of a game for
indertainment. dere was a whole lot of games an' riddles to be played
dem days. it have been so long sence i played any of 'em i'se mos' near
disremembers de biggest part of 'em. i 'members a song or two an' a few
riddles what ol' caleb use to tell us. de song goes sumpin' like dis:
saturday night an' sunday, too.
had a yaller gal on my mind.
monday mornin', break of day,
white folks had me gwine.
"de riddles was like dis;
slick as a mole, black as a coal,
got a great long tail like a thunder hole.
(skillet)
crooked as a rainbow, teeth lak a cat,
guess all of your life but you can't guess dat.
(black berry bush)
grows in de winter, dies in de spring,
lives wid de root stickin' straight up.
(icicle)
"dere was anudder song what caleb use to sing. it goes like dis:
whar you gwine buzzard? whar you gwine crow?
gwine down to de river to do jes' so.
"dere was a whole lot more to dat song what i disremembers.
"anudder song what comes to my min' is:
hawk an' de buzzard went down to de law;
when de hawk got back he had a broken jaw.
lady's pocketbook on de judge's bench
haden' had no use for a pocketbook sence.
"sometimes i visits wid ol' mingo white an' me an' him talks over dem
days dat me an' him was boys. we gits to talkin' an' 'fore you knows it
ol' mingo is cryin' lak a baby. 'cordin' to what he says he is lucky ter
be a-livin'. dis is one thing i never likes ter talk 'bout. when slavery
was goin' on it was all right for me 'cause i never had it hard, but it
jes' wan't right to treat human bein's dat way. if we hadn't a-had to
work an' slave for nothin' we might have somepin' to show for what we
did do, an' wouldn't have to live from pillar to pos' now.
william henry towns, [tr: tuscumbia?], alabama
"speakin' of clothin', everything that we wore back den was made by
han'. many a night my ma use' to set an' spin wid a spindle. i have set
an' done the cardin' for her so she could git her tas' done. in de
summer we would wear un'erwear what was made outten cotton. in de
winter it was made outten flannel. de shoes was made of cowhide what was
tanned right dere on de place. dem was de hardes' shoes i ever seen.
sometimes dey'd wear out 'fore dey was any ways soft, an' den sometimes
atter dey was wore out you couldn't hardly ben' 'em. some of de han's
would go bar'footed until de fall an' den wear shoes. slippers wan't
wore den. de fust pair of slippers i ever 'members havin' was de ones
what i bought for my weddin'. dey didn't cos' but a dollar an' six bits.
my weddin' suit didn't cos' but eight dollars, an' a straw hat to match
it cos' six bits.
"as i said afore, massa young an' ol' mistis was mighty good folks on
'count of dey never whupped any of they han's. iffen dere was one dat
would give trouble dey would git rid of him. de overseers had to be kin'
to de hands or else he was outten a job. de chillun was mighty nice,
too. ever' time dey went to town or to de sto' dey would bring us
younguns some candy or somepin'. joinin' our farm was a farm whar de
slaves fared lak dogs. dey was always beatin' on some of dem.
"ever'body worked hard enduring' dat time. dat was all we thought we was
'spose' to do, but abe lincoln taught us better'n dat. some say dat abe
wan't intrusted so much in freein' de slaves as he was in savin' de
union. don' make no diff'ence iffen he wan't intrusted in de black
folks, he sho' done a big thing by tryin' to save de union. some of de
slaveholders would double de proportion of work so as to git to whip 'em
when night come. i heard my ma say after slavery that dey jes' whipped
de slaves so much to keep dem cowed down an' 'cause dey might have
fought for freedom much sooner'n it did come.
"caleb come from n'orleans, louiseanner. he say dat many a day ship
loads of slaves was unloaded dere an' sold to de one offerin' de mos'
money for dem. dey had big chains an' shackles on dem to keep 'em from
gittin' away. sometime dey would have to go a long ways to git to de
farm. dey would go in a wagon or on hoss back.
"talk 'bout learnin' to read an' 'rite—why, iffen we so much as spoke
of learnin' to read an' 'rite we was scolded like de debil. iffen we was
caught lookin' in a book we was treated same as iffen we had killed
somebody. a servant bett'nt be caught lookin' in a book; didn't make no
diff'ence if you wan't doin' nothin' but lookin' at de pictures.
"speakin' of church; we went to de same church as de white folks did;
only thing was we had to go in de evenin' atter de white folks. de white
folks would go along an' read de bible for de preacher, an' to keep dem
from talkin of things dat might help dem to git free. dey would sing
songs like 'steal away,' 'been toilin' at the hill so long,' an'
'old-time religion.'
"ever' once in a while slaves would run away to de north. mos' times dey
was caught an' brought back. sometimes dey would git desp'rit an' would
kill demse'ves 'fore dey would stand to be brought back. one time dat i
heard of a slave that had 'scaped and when dey tried to ketch him he
jumped in de creek an' drown hisse'f. he was brought from over in
geo'gia. he hadn't been in alabama long 'fore him an' two more tried to
'scape; two of 'em was caught an' brought back but dis yuther one went
to de lan' of sweet dreams.
"after de day's work was done an' all had eat, de slaves had to go to
bed. mos' slaves worked on sat'day jes' lak dey did on monday; that was
from kin' to caught, or from sun to sun. mr. young never worked his
slaves 'twell dark on sat'day. he always let 'em quit 'roun' fo' 'clock.
we would spen' dis time washin' an' bathin' to git ready for church on
sunday. speakin' of holidays; de han's celebrated ever' holiday dat deir
white folks celebrated. dere wan't much to do for indertainment,
'ceptin' what i'se already said. ever' christmas we'd go to de big house
an' git our present, 'cause ol' mistis always give us one.
"slaves never got sick much, but when dey did dey got de bes'. dere was
always a nurse on de farm, and when a slave got sick dey was righ' dere
to give dem treatments. back in dose days dey used all sorts of roots
and yarbs for medicine. peach tree leaves was one of de mos' of'en.
sassafras was anudder what was used of'en; hit was used mostly in de
spring made in tea. asafetida was anudder what was use to keep you from
havin' azma. hit was wore 'round de neck in a lil bag. prickler ash was
anudder what was tooken in de spring. hit was 'spose ter clean de blood.
some of de folks would use brass, copper an' dimes wid holes in 'em to
keep from havin' their rumertiz.
"i was seben years old when de war commence. i 'members mrs. young said
when de yankees come dey was goin' to ast us iffen dey had been good to
us. she said dat dey was goin' to ast us all 'bout how much money dey
had; an' how many slaves what dey owned. she told us to say dey was po'
folks an' dat dey didn't have no money. i 'member my mother said dat she
hoped mr. young and dem to hide deir money som'ers in a well dat wan't
bein' used 'cause it gone dry. dem yankees sho' did clean up whar they
went along. dey would ketch chickens by de bunches and kill 'em an' den
turn 'roun' an' make de ol' mistis clean 'em an' cook 'em for dem. dem
yankees set fire to bales an' bales of cotton. dey took de white folks
clo'se an' did away wid 'em. sometimes dey would tear 'em up or give dem
to de slaves to wear. de war ended in sixty-five an' i was eleben years
ol' den.
"jes' atter de war we was turned loose to go for ourse'f. what i mean by
dat, we was free. i didn't mean that we lef' mr. young's 'cause we
stayed wid him for de longest atter slavery was over.
"my fust work was in a blacksmith shop down on west six street. i worked
for fifty cents a day den until i learned de trade. atter i worked at de
blacksmith shop for about two years i took up carpenter work. i served
apprentice for three years. i followed carpent'ing the res' of my life.
"i married lizzie anderson when i was twenty-one years ol'. she wan't
but seventeen years ol'. we didn't have no big weddin', we jes' had de
fambly dere. i raised ten chillun up until april de twenty fourth.
that's when william henry died. my chilluns doin' pretty well in life.
dere's two of my sons what's doctors; one is a carpenter. the other one
is grand orator of the shriners. my gals is doin' fine, too. three of
'em is been school teachers, one a beauty cult'ist an' de other one a
nurse. i feels sati'fied 'bout my chillun now. dey seems to be able to
make a livin' for they se'ves pretty well.
"i thinks that abe lincoln was a mighty fine man even if he was tryin'
to save their union. i don't like to talk 'bout this that have done
happened. it done passed so i don't say much 'bout it, specially de
presidents, 'cause it might cause a 'sturbance right now. all men means
well, but some of 'em ain't broadminded 'nough to do anythin' for nobody
but themse'fs. any man that tries to help humanity is a good man."
stepney underwood
interview with stepney underwood
—john morgan smith
"yassuh, i was a slave. i was tin year' old whin de war begin." uncle
stepney spoke the words between intermittent jerks of an uncontrollable
voice. the nervousness which resulted from hard work and a long struggle
for existence had not only given him palsy, but had left him with an
upheaving diaphragm. thus he shook and shivered while stuttering so
constantly as to be almost unintelligible.
"my mammy belonged to the johnstons and my pappy was owned by the
underwoods," he continued; "dey lived next to each other on two big
plantations in lowndes county. dey was good peoples—dem underwoods. i
remembers dat dey use to think i was as funny as a little monkey. de
massa usta laugh his head off at me, and when dere was parties, de
guestes would always say: 'whar stepney? we wants to see stepney dance.'
i usta cut many a [...] pigeon wing fur 'em.
"one day atter i finish' my chores, i slip off an go across de line to
see my mammy. when i was a-comin' back th'ough de woods, i met up wid
two pattyrollers. dey stop me and say: 'nigger, who you belong to?'
"'massa jim johns'on,' i answers.
"'whut you a doin' out here, den?' dey say, all de time a slippin' a
little closer so's to grab me.
"i don't take time to gib 'em no mo' answers kaze i knowd dat dis meant
a beatin'. i starts my legs a-flyin' an' i runs through de fores' lak a
scar't rabbit wid dem pattyrollers right behin' me. my bare feets flew
over dem stones an' i jus' hit de high spots in de groun'. i knowed dem
two mens didn't have no chance to kotch me, but dis sho meant a whuppin'
when i got home.
stepney underwood, [tr: birmingham], alabama
"but i didn't go home dat night. i stay out in de woods and buil' me a
little fiah. i laid down under a sycamo' tree a-tryin' ter make up my
min' ter go an' take dat beatin'. i heered de panthers a screamin' a way
off in de fores' an' de wildcats a howlin', an' how i wished i coulda
been wid my mammy. eve'y now and den, i could see eyes a shinin' in de
darkness an' rustlin's in de bushes. warn't no use of me a-cryin' kaze i
was a long way fum home an' dere warn't no one to could hear me. eve'y
thing seem to be agin' me. far off across de ridge i heered a screech
owl a-callin', an' i knowd dat meant death. i was glad i had my overalls
on so's i could turn my pockets inside out'ards to stop him. atter i
done dis, he sho-nuf stopped. den my lef' ear it commence to ichin', and
i knowd dat someone was a-sayin' somethin' mean about me. probably dat
oberseer dat was a-goin' to whup me when i got home. soon i fell slap to
sleep on a bed of moss. de nex' day i was awful hongry, an' long 'bout
de time de sun was a-comin' ober de ridge, i heerd some mens a-comin'
through de brush. it was de massa, de oberseer an' some mo' mens. i runs
toward de massa and i calls as loud as i could: 'massa jim, here i is.'
"he come up wid an awful frown on his face and de oberseer, he had a big
whup in his han'.
"'you little bur-head nigger debil', de massa say, 'i teach you ter run
away fum yo' place. come on home; i'se gwine give you a good breakfast
an' fix you up in some decent clothes. i'se got visitors a-comin' an'
heah you is out in de woods when i needs you to dance.' den de massa, he
smile lak i ain't done nothin' wrong. 'i guess you wants yo mammy, you
little lonesome pickaninny. well, i s'pose i hadda go ober and buy her.
you little debil you—now git on home.'"
charlie van dyke
personal conversation with charlie van dyke
 s. lawrence street, mobile, ala.
—written by mary a. poole
an old colored man, named charlie van dyke, living at  s. lawrence
street, mobile, ala. claims to be  years old, but he has no authentic
record of his birth. he told the writer he was born in north carolina,
and when he was ten years old, mr. william martee king, who owned his
mother, "nellie drish", moved to tuscaloosa, ala., where the king family
remained about a year, moving then from tuscaloosa down into dallas
county, near selma, ala.
while mr. and mrs. king and their family remained in tuscaloosa,
charlies mother nellie drish met and married william van dyke, who
belonged to the van dykes, who owned the neighboring plantation.
charlie assumed his step-father's name, but knew little of him, or of
the van dykes to whom his step-father belonged, because, as charlie
explained to the writer, after the kings moved down in dallas county,
(as charlie always referred to his home in alabama) and brought his
mother nellie and her family with them, his stepfather could only visit
them once a year, and that privilege was given him on christmas day. he
had to start back the next day, as he had to make the trip to and fro on
horse back.
uncle charlie said the kings owned about a thousand acres in dallas
county and had about a hundred head of slaves, but with all their riches
they lived in a plain plank house.
he smiled and said, "now-a-days folks passing such a house, would say
'colored folks live there.'"
the slave quarters were the regular log wood cabins, said uncle charlie,
with space between each row and a little plot of ground to separate each
cabin to itself.
uncle charlie said his mother cooked for the white folks, and sometimes
she didn't get down to their cabin but on sunday afternoon, that he
being the oldest had to look after the younger children, and that he was
never required to do heavy work as he broke his leg when a boy, so the
folks let him just work around the yard and look after his sisters and
brothers and also the other slave children.
uncle charlie said mr. king traveled a lot, went to france once, that
took almost a year and the overseer had full charge and he was mean and
made everybody stand around. he even made the slaves shuck corn on
sundays, each had their allotted amount to shuck before they could stop.
when the writer asked about church on the plantation, uncle charlie
replied: "church was what they called it but all that preacher talked
about was for us slaves to obey our masters and not to lie and steal.
nothing about jesus was ever said, and the overseer stood there to see
the preacher talked as he wanted him to talk."
the only day that uncle charlie said they were given any real holiday
was christmas, everybody got his drink of whiskey on christmas, and not
another drink until next christmas, "it sure seemed a long time between
drinks", added charlie with a smile.
uncle charlie said they did let you have a funeral when some one died,
they made the coffin on the plantation and carried it by hand to the
graveyard, singing as they went along. he tried to recall the hymns, but
all he could chant in a sing-song way was,
last word he said was about jerusalem
and he traveled along to the grave!
when asked about war days, uncle charlie was first on the confederate
side, then on the northern side, and he seemed somewhat bewildered about
it all, he said he saw a stockade, as he called it, in selma, ala., and
he remembered food stuff being sent to the soldiers, and also recalled
the yankees coming, and a captain coming up the road and telling them
the soldiers were coming. uncle charlie said the colored folks thought
the captain had to go back north before they came back, but in a flash
like lightening there they were, hundreds of them, and they scared folks
so bad some of them jumped in the river and tried to swim across and
those that couldn't, they just drowned.
when the writer tried to check up on uncle charlie's age, asking him how
old he was when the war started, he replied:
"i dont know but i was a man long afore it all started, lady, and i was
thirty-three years old when i married 'bout a year after the surrender."
when asked why he waited so long to get married, uncle charlie said:
"didn't you know in slavery days they wouldn't alow a man to marry
unless he could split a hundred rails a day?"
the writer smiled and said:
"now, uncle charlie," and then he chuckled, and said:
"well, i guess the right one didn't come 'long till i met her."
when asked if he had a regular wedding feast, he replied.
"yes, lady, it took $. to put me on the floor."
charlie and theresa had "five head of children", as uncle charlie
expressed it, of which three are dead and two living, but he claims his
children do not look after him, but his church folks and friends give
him the helping hand. he is a member of the st. luke missionary baptist
church, of mobile.
uncle charlie says he has his religion from the foregone prophets, that
he "don't understand this day religion", that he came along when people
were serving daniel's god, and when people had to be born again, now
they serve a sanctified god and jump from one religion to another.
uncle charlie finished the interview by saying, "lord teach me how to
pray, and teach me to love it woo."
lilah walker
interview with lilah walker
—william b. strickland, carbon hill
i walked through a small glade overshadowed by large oak trees, near
carbon hill in walker county, alabama. a weird little cabin confronted
me; its porch and steps loosely held to the main part of the structure
by a few weak boards. lilah walker, an old negro woman, squatted on the
steps with her chin resting in her black hands, in an attitude of deep
reverie. as the old woman heard me approaching she raised her head in
cordial greeting.
"come in, young marster," she said. "how is you today?"
"fine, aunt lilah," i answered. 'how's the world treating you?"
"oh, i can't complain," she replied.
the old woman continued.
"it mought be safer to set inside, 'case dey says when de sun swing low
lak dis dat de miassahs whut make you sick 'gin to rise outten yon'
swamp." then she chuckled: "i bin here since 'fo' de wah, an' i ain't
neber seen no miassahs rise outten dat swamp yit. yassuh, dat sho is so,
but from whut i seed rise outten it my 'pinion is dat dey done lef' long
'fo' dis. but i seed quare wings whirrin' outten dat swamp jus' 'fo'
days atter de surrender, an' i seed 'em near 'bout eve'y day since. i
seed 'em an' i heered 'em jus' a whirrin'!
"nawsuh, i sho can't 'splain de wings, but i is got my 'pinion how come
dey is. when i tells you whut took place here durin' dem dark ole days,
den maybe you'll hab yourn. ole mistis died 'fo de war, an' ole massa,
he too ole to go. he didn't do nothin' but set aroun' an' read de books
an' papers. 'peer lak to me he jus' plum forgit 'bout young mistis after
her mammy died, an' de little gal jus' growed up lak a wild flower in de
woods, cep'n for a handsome young boy on de nex' plantation. dey was
nearly always together.
"by an' by de boy got ole enough to go to de wah. it was jus' a little
fo' de close. den young mistis, she droop an' she droop. 'reckley she
'gin to swoon, long jus' anywheres she would. one day she swoon an'
nothin' i could do would bring her back to her senses. i jus' couldn't
fetch her to. i call ole massa an' he git a doctor. dey putt me outten
de room an' i ain't neber heared whut dat doctor said till yit, but ole
massa, he go stark wild. he holla an' carry on in his sleep all de
night; an' de nex' day he druv' de young mistis away. dere was a cabin
den in de swamp, an' she went dar to live. i snuk out dar an' tote her
vittles to her fo' days an' days. she always grab me an' say: 'don't you
love me an' don't you believe in me, mammy?'
"'co'se i does, honey chile, 'ca'se i useta sing to you 'bout de good
ole lan' of promise.' den i says to her: 'dese times is powerful
triflin', an' maybe 'fo' long i's gwine home an' de white folks will
miss me 'ca'se dey can't raise chilluns.' den she cry an' i cry.
"'bout dat time de word come of de surrender. ole massa seem to come to
his wits den an' he kep' a close watch on me so's i can't leave de house
to carry de food. on de fo'th day, i cotch a chance an' i snuck off.
when i come close to de cabin i call, but young mistis neber answer. den
i went to de do', but i neber go in de do', 'ca'se millions of black
wings come a-whirrin' outten de house. i run an' run an' i pray too, but
de big black wings still follow me. sometimes in de early mornin' i
still hears an' sees two pairs of wings, sometimes white, sometimes
black.
"yassuh, i is aimin' to tell you 'bout ole massa; whut 'come of him. one
evenin' i ventured to de aidge of dat swamp, an' somep'n cracked under
my feets. i is jus' about to run when i sees it's jus' a piece of paper.
i sees it has writin' on it so i taken it to ole massa. den when he read
dat he sho 'nough go plum crazy. 'bout dat time dey open what dey called
a 'sane 'slylum in tusaloosy an' dey taken ole massa dar an' a little
later he died.
