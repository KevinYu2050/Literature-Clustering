 suffered all. before she rose, she no longer bore the name of maid; in the
 morning she was a new-made dame. that day the minstrels were in happy
 mood, for they were all well paid. they were fully compensated for the
 entertainment they had given, and many a handsome gift was bestowed upon
 them: robes of grey squirrel skin and ermine, of rabbit skins and violet
 stuffs, scarlets and silken stuffs. whether it be a horse or money, each
 one got what he deserved according to his skill. and thus the wedding
 festivities and the court lasted almost a fortnight with great joy and
 magnificence. for his own glory and satisfaction, as well as to honour
 erec the more, king arthur made all the knights remain a full fortnight.
 when the third week began, all together by common consent agreed to hold a
 tournament. on the one side, my lord gawain offered himself as surety that
 it would take place between evroic and tenebroc: and meliz and meliadoc
 were guarantors on the other side. then the court separated.
 (vv. -.) a month after pentecost the tournament assembled, and the
 jousting began in the plain below tenebroc. many an ensign of red, blue,
 and white, many a veil and many a sleeve were bestowed as tokens of love.
 many a lance was carried there, flying the colours argent and green, or
 gold and azure blue. there were many, too, with different devices, some
 with stripes and some with dots. that day one saw laced on many a helmet
 of gold or steel, some green, some yellow, and others red, all aglowing in
 the sun; so many scutcheons and white hauberks; so many swords girt on the
 left side; so many good shields, fresh and new, some resplendent in silver
 and green, others of azure with buckles of gold; so many good steeds
 marked with white, or sorrel, tawny, white, black, and bay: all gather
 hastily. and now the field is quite covered with arms. on either side the
 ranks tremble, and a roar rises from the fight. the shock of the lances is
 very great. lances break and shields are riddled, the hauberks receive
 bumps and are torn asunder, saddles go empty and horsemen ramble, while
 the horses sweat and foam. swords are quickly drawn on those who tumble
 noisily, and some run to receive the promise of a ransom, others to stave
 off this disgrace. erec rode a white horse, and came forth alone at the
 head of the line to joust, if he may find an opponent. from the opposite
 side there rides out to meet him orguelleus de la lande, mounted on an
 irish steed which bears him along with marvellous speed. on the shield
 before his breast erec strikes him with such force that he knocks him from
 his horse: he leaves him prone and passes on. then raindurant opposed him,
 son of the old dame of tergalo, covered with blue cloth of silk; he was a
 knight of great prowess. against one another now they charge and deal
 fierce blows on the shields about their neck. erec from lance's length
 lays him over on the hard ground. while riding back he met the king of the
 red city, who was very valiant and bold. they grasp their reins by the
 knots and their shields by the inner straps. they both had fine arms, and
 strong swift horses, and good shields, fresh and new. with such fury they
 strike each other that both their lances fly in splinters. never was there
 seen such a blow. they rush together with shields, arms, and horses. but
 neither girth nor rein nor breast-strap could prevent the king from coming
 to earth. so he flew from his steed, carrying with him saddle and stirrup,
 and even the reins of his bridle in his hand. all those who witnessed the
 jousting were filled with amazement, and said it cost him dear to joust
 with such a goodly knight. erec did not wish to stop to capture either
 horse or rider, but rather to joust and distinguish himself in order that
 his prowess might appear. he thrills the ranks in front of him. gawain
 animates those who were on his side by his prowess, and by winning horses
 and knights to the discomfiture of his opponents. i speak of my lord
 gawain, who did right well and valiantly. in the fight he unhorsed
 guincel, and took gaudin of the mountain; he captured knights and horses
 alike: my lord gawain did well. girtlet the son of do, and yvain, and
 sagremor the impetuous, so evilly entreated their adversaries that they
 drove them back to the gates, capturing and unhorsing many of them. in
 front of the gate of the town the strife began again between those within
 and those without. there sagremor was thrown down, who was a very gallant
 knight. he was on the point of being detained and captured, when erec
 spurs to rescue him, breaking his lance into splinters upon one of the
 opponents. so hard he strikes him on the breast that he made him quit the
 saddle. then he made of his sword and advances upon them, crushing and
 splitting their helmets. some flee, and others make way before him, for
 even the boldest fears him. finally, he distributed so many blows and
 thrusts that he rescued sagremor from them, and drove them all in
 confusion into the town. meanwhile, the vesper hour drew to a close. erec
 bore himself so well that day that he was the best of the combatants. but
 on the morrow he did much better yet: for he took so many knights and left
 so many saddles empty that none could believe it except those who had seen
 it. every one on both sides said that with his lance and shield he had won
 the honours of the tournament. now was erec's renown so high that no one
 spoke save of him, nor was any one of such goodly favour. in countenance
 he resembled absalom, in language he seemed a solomon, in boldness he
 equalled samson,  and in generous giving and
 spending he was the equal of alexander. on his return from the tourney
 erec went to speak with the king. he went to ask him for leave to go and
 visit his own land; but first he thanked him like a frank, wise, and
 courteous man for the honour which he had done him; for very deep was his
 gratitude. then he asked his permission to leave, for he wished to visit
 his own country, and he wished to take his wife with him. this request the
 king could not deny, and yet he would have had him stay. he gives him
 leave and begs him to return as soon as possible: for in the whole court
 there was no better or more gallant knight, save only his dear nephew
 gawain; 
 with him no one could be compared. but next after him, he prized erec
 most, and held him more dear than any other knight.
 (vv. -.) erec wished to delay no longer. as soon as he had the
 king's leave, he bid his wife make her preparations, and he retained as
 his escort sixty knights of merit with horses and with dappled and grey
 furs. as soon as he was ready for his journey, he tarried little further
 at court, but took leave of the queen and commended the knights to god.
 the queen grants him leave to depart. at the hour of prime he set out from
 the royal palace. in the presence of them all he mounted his steed, and
 his wife mounted the dappled horse which she had brought from her own
 country; then all his escort mounted. counting knights and squires, there
 were full seven score in the train. after four long days' journey over
 hills and slopes, through forests, plains, and streams, they came on the
 fifth day to camant, where king lac was residing in a very charming town.
 no one ever saw one better situated; for the town was provided with
 forests and meadow-land, with vineyards and farms, with streams and
 orchards, with ladies and knights, and fine, lively youths, and polite,
 well-mannered clerks who spent their incomes freely, with fair and
 charming maidens, and with prosperous burghers. before erec reached the
 town, he sent two knights ahead to announce his arrival to the king. when
 he heard the news, the king had clerks, knights, and damsels quickly
 mount, and ordered the bells to be rung, and the streets to be hung with
 tapestries and silken stuffs, that his son might be received with joy;
 then he himself got on his horse. of clerks there were present fourscore,
 gentle and honourable men, clad in grey cloaks bordered with sable. of
 knights there were full five hundred, mounted on bay, sorrel, or
 white-spotted steeds. there were so many burghers and dames that no one
 could tell the number of them. the king and his son galloped and rode on
 till they saw and recognised each other. they both jump down from their
 horses and embrace and greet each other for a long time, without stirring
 from the place where they first met. each party wished the other joy: the
 king makes much of erec, but all at once breaks off to turn to enide. on
 all sides he is in clover: he embraces and kisses them both, and knows not
 which of the two pleases him the more. as they gaily enter the castle, the
 bells all ring their peals to honour erec's arrival. the streets are all
 strewn with reeds, mint, and iris, and are hung overhead with curtains and
 tapestries of fancy silk and satin stuffs. there was great rejoicing; for
 all the people came together to see their new lord, and no one ever saw
 greater happiness than was shown alike by young and old. first they came
 to the church, where very devoutly they were received in a procession.
 erec kneeled before the altar of the crucifix, and two knights led his
 wife to the image of our lady. when she had finished her prayer, she
 stepped back a little and crossed herself with her right hand, as a
 well-bred dame should do. then they came out from the church and entered
 the royal palace, when the festivity began. that day erec received many
 presents from the knights and burghers: from one a palfrey of northern
 stock, and from another a golden cup. one presents him with a golden
 pigeon-hawk, another with a setter-dog, this one a greyhound, this other a
 sparrowhawk, and another a swift arab steed, this one a shield, this one
 an ensign, this one a sword, and this a helmet. never was a king more
 gladly seen in his kingdom, nor received with greater joy, as all strove
 to serve him well. yet greater joy they made of enide than of him, for the
 great beauty which they saw in her, and still more for her open charm. she
 was seated in a chamber upon a cushion of brocade which had been brought
 from thessaly. round about her was many a fair lady; yet as the lustrous
 gem outshines the brown flint, and as the rose excels the poppy, so was
 enide fairer than any other lady or damsel to be found in the world,
 wherever one might search. she was so gentle and honourable, of wise
 speech and affable, of pleasing character and kindly mien. no one could
 ever be so watchful as to detect in her any folly, or sign of evil or
 villainy. she had been so schooled in good manners that she had learned
 all virtues which any lady can possess, as well as generosity and
 knowledge. all loved her for her open heart, and whoever could do her any
 service was glad and esteemed himself the more. no one spoke any ill of
 her, for no one could do so. in the realm or empire there was no lady of
 such good manners. but erec loved her with such a tender love that he
 cared no more for arms, nor did he go to tournaments, nor have any desire
 to joust; but he spent his time in cherishing his wife. he made of her his
 mistress and his sweetheart. he devoted all his heart and mind to fondling
 and kissing her, and sought no delight in other pastime. his friends
 grieved over this, and often regretted among themselves that he was so
 deep in love. often it was past noon before he left her side; for there he
 was happy, say what they might. he rarely left her society, and yet he was
 as open-handed as ever to his knights with arms, dress, and money. there
 was not a tournament anywhere to which he did not send them well
 apparelled and equipped. whatever the cost might be, he gave them fresh
 steeds for the tourney and joust. all the knights said it was a great pity
 and misfortune that such a valiant man as he was wont to be should no
 longer wish to bear arms. he was blamed so much on all sides by the
 knights and squires that murmurs reached enide's ears how that her lord
 had turned craven about arms and deeds of chivalry, and that his manner of
 life was greatly changed.  she grieved sorely over this,
 but she did not dare to show her grief; for her lord at once would take
 affront, if she should speak to him. so the matter remained a secret,
 until one morning they lay in bed where they had had sport together. there
 they lay in close embrace, like the true lovers they were. he was asleep,
 but she was awake, thinking of what many a man in the country was saying
 of her lord. and when she began to think it all over, she could not keep
 back the tears. such was her grief and her chagrin that by mischance she
 let fall a word for which she later felt remorse, though in her heart
 there was no guile. she began to survey her lord from head to foot, his
 well-shaped body and his clear countenance, until her tears fell fast upon
 the bosom of her lord, and she said: "alas, woe is me that i ever left my
 country! what did i come here to seek? the earth ought by right to swallow
 me up when the best knight, the most hardy, brave, fair, and courteous
 that ever was a count or king, has completely abjured all his deeds of
 chivalry because of me. and thus, in truth, it is i who have brought shame
 upon his head, though i would fain not have done so at any price." then
 she said to him: "unhappy thou!" and then kept silence and spoke no more.
 erec was not sound asleep and, though dozing, heard plainly what she said.
 he aroused at her words, and much surprised to see her weeping, he asked
 her: "tell me, my precious beauty, why do you weep thus? what has caused
 you woe or sorrow? surely it is my wish to know. tell me now, my gentle
 sweetheart; and raise care to keep nothing back, why you said that woe was
 me? for you said it of me and of no one else. i heard your words plainly
 enough." then was enide in a great plight, afraid and dismayed. "sire,"
 says she, "i know nothing of what you say." "lady, why do you conceal it?
 concealment is of no avail. you hare been crying; i can see that, and you
 do not cry for nothing. and in my sleep i heard what you said." "ah! fair
 sire, you never heard it, and i dare say it was a dream." "now you are
 coming to me with lies. i hear you calmly lying to me. but if you do not
 tell me the truth now, you will come to repent of it later." "sire, since
 you torment me thus, i will tell you the whole truth, and keep nothing
 back. but i am afraid that you will not like it. in this land they all say—the
 dark, the fair, and the ruddy—that it is a great pity that you
 should renounce your arms; your reputation has suffered from it. every one
 used to say not long ago that in all the world there was known no better
 or more gallant knight. now they all go about making game of you—old
 and young, little and great—calling you a recreant. do you suppose
 it does not give me pain to hear you thus spoken of with scorn? it grieves
 me when i hear it said, and yet it grieves me more that they put the blame
 for it on me. yes, i am blamed for it, i regret to say, and they all
 assert it is because i have so ensnared and caught you that you are losing
 all your merit, and do not care for aught but me. you must choose another
 course, so that you may silence this reproach and regain your former fame;
 for i have heard too much of this reproach, and yet i did not dare to
 disclose it to you. many a time, when i think of it, i have to weep for
 very grief. such chagrin i felt just now that i could not keep myself from
 saying that you were ill-starred." "lady," said he, "you were in the
 right, and those who blame me do so with reason. and now at once prepare
 yourself to take the road. rise up from here, and dress yourself in your
 richest robe, and order your saddle to be put on your best palfrey." now
 enide is in great distress: very sad and pensive, she gets up, blaming and
 upbraiding herself for the foolish words she spoke: she had now made her
 bed, and must lie in it. "ah!" said she, "poor fool! i was too happy, for
 there lacked me nothing. god! why was i so forward as to dare to utter
 such folly? god! did not my lord love me to excess? in faith, alas, he was
 too fond of me. and now i must go away into exile. but i have yet a
 greater grief, that i shall no longer see my lord, who loved me with such
 tenderness that there was nothing he held so dear. the best man that was
 ever born had become so wrapped up in me that he cared for nothing else. i
 lacked for nothing then. i was very happy. but pride it is that stirred me
 up: because of my pride, i must suffer woe for telling him such insulting
 words, and it is right that i should suffer woe. one does not know what
 good fortune is until he has made trial of evil." thus the lady bemoaned
 her fate, while she dressed herself fitly in her richest robe. yet nothing
 gave her any pleasure, but rather cause for deep chagrin. then she had a
 maid call one of her squires, and bids him saddle her precious palfrey of
 northern stock, than which no count or king ever had a better. as soon as
 she had given him the command, the fellow asked for no delay, but
 straightway went and saddled the dappled palfrey. and erec summoned
 another squire and bade him bring his arms to arm his body withal. then he
 went up into a bower, and had a limoges rug laid out before him on the
 floor. meanwhile, the squire ran to fetch the arms and came back and laid
 them on the rug. erec took a seat opposite, on the figure of a leopard
 which was portrayed on the rug. he prepares and gets ready to put on his
 arms: first, he had laced on a pair of greaves of polished steel; next, he
 dons a hauberk, which was so fine that not a mesh could be cut away from
 it. this hauberk of his was rich, indeed, for neither inside nor outside
 of it was there enough iron to make a needle, nor could it gather any
 rust; for it was all made of worked silver in tiny meshes triple-wove; and
 it was made with such skill that i can assure you that no one who had put
 it on would have been more uncomfortable or sore because of it, than if he
 had put on a silk jacket over his undershirt. the knights and squires all
 began to wonder why he was being armed; but no one dared to ask him why.
 when they had put on his hauberk, a valet laces about his head a helmet
 fluted with a band of gold, shining brighter than a mirror. then he takes
 the sword and girds it on, and orders them to bring him saddled his bay
 steed of gascony. then he calls a valet to him, and says: "valet, go
 quickly, run to the chamber beside the tower where my wife is, and tell
 her that she is keeping me waiting here too long. she has spent too much
 time on her attire. tell her to come and mount at once, for i am awaiting
 her." and the fellow goes and finds her all ready, weeping and making
 moan: and he straightway addressed her thus: "lady, why do you so delay?
 my lord is awaiting you outside yonder, already fully armed. he would have
 mounted some time ago, had you been ready." enide wondered greatly what
 her lord's intention was; but she very wisely showed herself with as
 cheerful a countenance as possible, when she appeared before him. in the
 middle of the courtyard she found him, and king lac comes running out.
 knights come running, too, striving with each other to reach there first.
 there is neither young nor old but goes to learn and ask if he will take
 any of them with him. so each offers and presents himself. but he states
 definitely and affirms that he will take no companion except his wife,
 asserting that he will go alone. then the king is in great distress. "fair
 son," says he, "what dost thou intend to do? thou shouldst tell me thy
 business and keep nothing back. tell me whither thou will go; for thou art
 unwilling on any account to be accompanied by an escort of squires or
 knights. if thou hast undertaken to fight some knight in single combat,
 yet shouldst thou not for that reason fail to take a part of thy knights
 with thee to betoken thy wealth and lordship. a king's son ought not to
 fare alone. fair son, have thy sumpters loaded now, and take thirty or
 forty or more of thy knights, and see that silver and gold is taken, and
 whatever a gentleman needs." finally erec makes reply and tells him all in
 detail how he has planned his journey. "sire," says he, "it must be so. i
 shall take no extra horse, nor have i any use for gold or silver, squire
 or sergeant; nor do i ask for any company save that of my wife alone. but
 i pray you, whatever may happen, should i die and she come back, to love
 her and hold her dear for love of me and for my prayer, and give her so
 long as she live, without contention or any strife, the half of your land
 to be her own." upon hearing his son's request, the king said: "fair son,
 i promise it. but i grieve much to see thee thus go off without escort,
 and if i had my way, thou shouldst not thus depart." "sire, it cannot be
 otherwise. i go now, and to god commend you. but keep in mind my
 companions, and give them horses and arms and all that knight may need."
 the king cannot keep back the tears when he is parted from his son. the
 people round about weep too; the ladies and knights shed tears and make
 great moan for him. there is not one who does not mourn, and many a one in
 the courtyard swoons. weeping, they kiss and embrace him, and are almost
 beside themselves with grief. i think they would not have been more sad if
 they had seen him dead or wounded. then erec said to comfort them: "my
 lords, why do you weep so sore? i am neither in prison nor wounded. you
 gain nothing by this display of grief. if i go away, i shall come again
 when it please god and when i can. to god i commend you one and all; so
 now let me go; too long you keep me here. i am sorry and grieved to see
 you weep." to god he commends them and they him.
 (vv. -.) so they departed, leaving sorrow behind them. erec
 starts, and leads his wife he knows not whither, as chance dictates. "ride
 fast," he says, "and take good care not to be so rash as to speak to me of
 anything you may see. take care never to speak to me, unless i address you
 first. ride on now fast and with confidence." "sire," says she, "it shall
 be done." she rode ahead and held her peace. neither one nor the other
 spoke a word. but enide's heart is very sad, and within herself she thus
 laments, soft and low that he may not hear: "alas," she says, "god had
 raised and exalted me to such great joy; but now he has suddenly cast me
 down. fortune who had beckoned me has quickly now withdrawn her hand. i
 should not mind that so much, alas, if only i dared to address my lord.
 but i am mortified and distressed because my lord has turned against me, i
 see it clearly, since he will not speak to me. and i am not so bold as to
 dare to look at him." while she thus laments, a knight who lived by
 robbery issued forth from the woods. he had two companions with him, and
 all three were armed. they covet the palfrey which enide rides. "my lords,
 do you know the news i bring?" says he to his two companions. "if we do
 not now make a haul, we are good-for-nothing cowards and are playing in
 bad luck. here comes a lady wondrous fair, whether married or not i do not
 know, but she is very richly dressed. the palfrey and saddle, with the
 breast-strap and reins, are worth a thousand livres of chartres. i will
 take the palfrey for mine, and the rest of the booty you may have. i don't
 want any more for my share. the knight shall not lead away the lady, so
 help me god. for i intend to give him such a thrust as he will dearly pay.
 i it was who saw him first, and so it is my right to go the first and
 offer battle." they give him leave and he rides off, crouching well
 beneath his shield, while the other two remain aloof. in those days it was
 the custom and practice that in an attack two knights should not join
 against one; thus if they too had assailed him, it would seem that they
 had acted treacherously. enide saw the robbers, and was seized with great
 fear. "god," says she, "what can i say? now my lord will be either killed
 or made a prisoner; for there are three of them and he is alone. the
 contest is not fair between one knight and three. that fellow will strike
 him now at a disadvantage; for my lord is off his guard. god, shall i be
 then such a craven as not to dare to raise my voice? such a coward i will
 not be: i will not fail to speak to him." on the spot she turns about and
 calls to him: "fair sire, of what are you thinking? there come riding
 after you three knights who press you hard. i greatly fear they will do
 you harm." "what?" says erec, "what's that you say? you have surely been
 very bold to disdain my command and prohibition. this time you shall be
 pardoned; but if it should happen another time, you would not be
 forgiven." then turning his shield and lance, he rushes at the knight. the
 latter sees him coming and challenges him. when erec hears him, he defies
 him. both give spur and clash together, holding their lances at full
 extent. but he missed erec, while erec used him hard; for he knew well the
 right attack. he strikes him on the shield so fiercely that he cracks it
 from top to bottom. nor is his hauberk any protection: erec pierces and
 crushes it in the middle of his breast, and thrusts a foot and a half of
 his lance into his body. when he drew back, he pulled out the shaft. and
 the other fell to earth. he must needs die, for the blade had drunk of his
 life's blood. then one of the other two rushes forward, leaving his
 companion behind, and spurs toward erec, threatening him. erec firmly
 grasps his shield, and attacks him with a stout heart. the other holds his
 shield before his breast. then they strike upon the emblazoned shields.
 the knight's lance flies into two bits, while erec drives a quarter of
 lance's length through the other's breast. he will give him no more
 trouble. erec unhorses him and leaves him in a faint, while he spurs at an
 angle toward the third robber. when the latter saw him coming on he began
 to make his escape. he was afraid, and did not dare to face him; so he
 hastened to take refuge in the woods. but his flight is of small avail,
 for erec follows him close and cries aloud: "vassal, vassal, turn about
 now, and prepare to defend yourself, so that i may not slay you in act of
 flight. it is useless to try to escape." but the fellow has no desire to
 turn about, and continues to flee with might and main. following and
 overtaking him, erec hits him squarely on his painted shield, and throws
 him over on the other side. to these three robbers he gives no further
 heed: one he has killed, another wounded, and of the third he got rid by
 throwing him to earth from his steed. he took the horses of all three and
 tied them together by the bridles. in colour they were not alike: the
 first was white as milk, the second black and not at all bad looking,
 while the third was dappled all over. he came back to the road where enide
 was awaiting him. he bade her lead and drive the three horses in front of
 her, warning her harshly never again to be so bold as to speak a single
 word unless he give her leave. she makes answer: "i will never do so, fair
 sire, if it be your will." then they ride on, and she holds her peace.
 (vv. -.) they had not yet gone a league when before them in a
 valley there came five other knights, with lances in rest, shields held
 close in to the neck, and their shining helmets laced up tight; they, too,
 were on plunder bent. all at once they saw the lady approach in charge of
 the three horses, and erec who followed after. as soon as they saw them,
 they divided their equipment among themselves, just as if they had already
 taken possession of it. covetousness is a bad thing. but it did not turn
 out as they expected; for vigorous defence was made. much that a fool
 plans is not executed, and many a man misses what he thinks to obtain. so
 it befell them in this attack. one said that he would take the maid or
 lose his life in the attempt; and another said that the dappled steed
 shall be his, and that he will be satisfied with that. the third said that
 he would take the black horse. "and the white one for me," said the
 fourth. the fifth was not at all backward, and vowed that he would have
 the horse and arms of the knight himself. he wished to win them by
 himself, and would fain attack him first, if they would give him leave:
 and they willingly gave consent. then he leaves them and rides ahead on a
 good and nimble steed. erec saw him, but made pretence that he did not yet
 notice him. when enide saw them, her heart jumped with fear and great
 dismay. "alas!" said she, "i know not what to say or do; for my lord
 severely threatens me, and says that he will punish me, if i speak a word
 to him. but if my lord were dead now, there would be no comfort for me. i
 should be killed and roughly treated. god! my lord does not see them! why,
 then, do i hesitate, crazed as i am? i am indeed too chary of my words,
 when i have not already spoken to him. i know well enough that those who
 are coming yonder are intent upon some wicked deed. and god! how shall i
 speak to him? he will kill me. well, let him kill me! yet i will not fail
 to speak to him." then she softly calls him: "sire!" "what?" says he,
 "what do you want?" "your pardon, sire. i want to tell you that five
 knights have emerged from yonder thicket, of whom i am in mortal fear.
 having noticed them, i am of the opinion that they intend to fight with
 you. four of them have stayed behind, and the other comes toward you as
 fast as his steed can carry him. i am afraid every moment lest he will
 strike you. 'tis true, the four have stayed behind; but still they are not
 far away, and will quickly aid him, if need arise." erec replies: "you had
 an evil thought, when you transgressed my command—a thing which i
 had forbidden you. and yet i knew all the time that you did not hold me in
 esteem. your service has been ill employed; for it has not awakened my
 gratitude, but rather kindled the more my ire. i have told you that once,
 and i say it again. this once again i will pardon you; but another time
 restrain yourself, and do not again turn around to watch me: for in doing
 so you would be very foolish. i do not relish your words." then he spurs
 across the field toward his adversary, and they come together. each seeks
 out and assails the other. erec strikes him with such force that his
 shield flies from his neck, and thus he breaks his collar-bone. his
 stirrups break, and he falls without the strength to rise again, for he
 was badly bruised and wounded. one of the others then appeared, and they
 attack each other fiercely. without difficulty erec thrusts the sharp and
 well forged steel into his neck beneath the chin, severing thus the bones
 and nerves. at the back of his neck the blade protrudes, and the hot red
 blood flows down on both sides from the wound. he yields his spirit, and
 his heart is still. the third sallies forth from his hiding-place on the
 other side of a ford. straight through the water, on he comes. erec spurs
 forward and meets him before he came out of the water, striking him so
 hard that he beats down flat both rider and horse. the steed lay upon the
 body long enough to drown him in the stream, and then struggled until with
 difficulty he got upon his feet. thus he conquered three of them, when the
 other two thought it wise to quit the conflict and not to strive with him.
 in flight they follow the stream, and erec after them in hot pursuit,
 until he strikes one upon the spine so hard that he throws him forward
 upon the saddle-bow. he put all his strength into the blow, and breaks his
 lance upon his body, so that the fellow fell head foremost. erec makes him
 pay dearly for the lance which he has broken on him, and drew his sword
 from the scabbard. the fellow unwisely straightened up; for erec gave him
 three such strokes that he slaked his sword's thirst in his blood. he
 severs the shoulder from his body, so that it fell down on the ground.
 then, with sword drawn, he attacked the other, as he sought to escape
 without company or escort. when he sees erec pursuing him, he is so afraid
 that he knows not what to do: he does not dare to face him, and cannot
 turn aside; he has to leave his horse, for he has no more trust in him. he
 throws away his shield and lance, and slips from his horse to earth. when
 he saw him on his feet, erec no longer cared to pursue him, but he stooped
 over for the lance, not wishing to leave that, because of his own which
 had been broken. he carries off his lance and goes away, not leaving the
 horses behind: he catches all five of them and leads them off. enide had
 hard work to lead them all; for he hands over all five of them to her with
 the other three, and commands her to go along smartly, and to keep from
 addressing him in order that no evil or harm may come to her. so not a
 word does she reply, but rather keeps silence; and thus they go, leading
 with them all the eight horses.
 (vv. -.) they rode till nightfall without coming to any town or
 shelter. when night came on, they took refuge beneath a tree in an open
 field. erec bids his lady sleep, and he will watch. she replies that she
 will not, for it is not right, and she does not wish to do so. it is for
 him to sleep who is more weary. well pleased at this, erec accedes.
 beneath his head he placed his shield, and the lady took her cloak, and
 stretched it over him from head to foot. thus, he slept and she kept
 watch, never dozing the whole night, but holding tight in her hand by the
 bridle the horses until the morning broke; and much she blamed and
 reproached herself for the words which she had uttered, and said that she
 acted badly, and was not half so ill-treated as she deserved to be.
 "alas," said she, "in what an evil hour have i witnessed my pride and
 presumption! i might have known without doubt that there was no knight
 better than, or so good as, my lord. i knew it well enough before, but now
 i know it better. for i have seen with my own eyes how he has not quailed
 before three or even five armed men. a plague for ever upon my tongue for
 having uttered such pride and insult as now compel me to suffer shame!"
 all night long she thus lamented until the morning dawned. erec rises
 early, and again they take the road, she in front and he behind. at noon a
 squire met them in a little valley, accompanied by two fellows who were
 carrying cakes and wine and some rich autumn cheeses to those who were
 mowing the hay in the meadows belonging to count galoain. the squire was a
 clever fellow, and when he saw erec and enide, who were coming from the
 direction of the woods, he perceived that they must have spent the night
 in the forest and had had nothing to eat or drink; for within a radius of
 a day's journey there was no town, city or tower, no strong place or
 abbey, hospice or place of refuge. so he formed an honest purpose and
 turned his steps toward them, saluting them politely and saving: "sire, i
 presume that you have had a hard experience last night. i am sure you have
 had no sleep and have spent the night in these woods. i offer you some of
 this white cake, if it please you to partake of it. i say it not in hope
 of reward: for i ask and demand nothing of you. the cakes are made of good
 wheat; i have good wine and rich cheeses, too, a white cloth and fine
 jugs. if you feel like taking lunch, you need not seek any farther.
 beneath these white beeches, here on the greensward, you might lay off
 your arms and rest yourself a while. my advice is that you dismount." erec
 got down from his horse and said: "fair gentle friend, i thank you kindly:
 i will eat something, without going farther." the young man knew well what
 to do: he helped the lady from her horse, and the boys who had come with
 the squire held the steeds. then they go and sit down in the shade. the
 squire relieves erec of his helmet, unlaces the mouth-piece from before
 his face; then he spreads out the cloth before them on the thick tuff. he
 passes them the cake and wine, and prepares and cuts a cheese. hungry as
 they were, they helped themselves, and gladly drank of the wine. the
 squire serves them and omits no attention. when they had eaten and drunk
 their fill, erec was courteous and generous. "friend," says he, "as a
 reward, i wish to present you with one of my horses. take the one you like
 the best. and i pray it may be no hardship for you to return to the town
 and make ready there a goodly lodging." and he replies that he will gladly
 do whatever is his will. then he goes up to the horses and, untying them,
 chooses the dapple, and speaks his thanks; for this one seems to be the
 best. up he springs by the left stirrup, and leaving them both there, he
 rode off to the town at top speed, where he engaged suitable quarters. now
 behold! he is back again: "now mount, sire, quickly," says he, "for you
 have a good fine lodging ready." erec mounted, and then his lady, and, as
 the town was hard by, they soon had reached their lodging-place. there
 they were received with joy. the host with kindness welcomed them, and
 with joy and gladness made generous provision for their needs.
 (vv. -.) when the squire had done for them all the honour that he
 could do, he came and mounted his horse again, leading it off in front of
 the count's bower to the stable. the count and three of his vassals were
 leaning out of the bower, when the count, seeing his squire mounted on the
 dappled steed, asked him whose it was. and he replied that it was his. the
 count, greatly astonished, says: "how is that? where didst thou get him?"
 "a knight whom i esteem highly gave him to me, sire," says he. "i have
 conducted him within this town, and he is lodged at a burgher's house. he
 is a very courteous knight and the handsomest man i ever saw. even if i
 had given you my word and oath, i could not half tell you how handsome he
 is." the count replies: "i suppose and presume that he is not more
 handsome than i am." "upon my word, sire," the sergeant says, "you are
 very handsome and a gentleman. there is not a knight in this country, a
 native of this land, whom you do not excel in favour. but i dare maintain
 concerning this one that he is fairer than you, if he were not beaten
 black and blue beneath his hauberk, and bruised. in the forest he has been
 fighting single-handed with eight knights, and leads away their eight
 horses. and there comes with him a lady so fair that never lady was half
 so fair as she."  when the count hears this
 news, the desire takes him to go and see if this is true or false. "i
 never heard such a thing," says he; "take me now to his lodging-place, for
 certainly i wish to know if thou dost lie or speak the truth." he replies:
 "right gladly, sire. this is the way and the path to follow, for it is not
 far from here." "i am anxious to see them," says the count. then he comes
 down, and the squire gets off his horse, and makes the count mount in his
 place. then he ran ahead to tell erec that the count was coming to visit
 him. erec's lodging was rich indeed—the kind to which he was
 accustomed. there were many tapers and candles lighted all about. the
 count came attended by only three companions. erec, who was of gracious
 manners, rose to meet him, and exclaimed: "welcome, sire!" and the count
 returned his salutation. they both sat down side by side upon a soft white
 couch, where they chat with each other. the count makes him an offer and
 urges him to consent to accept from him a guarantee for the payment of his
 expenses in the town. but erec does not deign to accept, saying he is well
 supplied with money, and has no need to accept aught from him. they speak
 long of many things, but the count constantly glances about in the other
 direction, where he caught sight of the lady. because of her manifest
 beauty, he fixed all his thought on her. he looked at her as much as he
 could; he coveted her, and she pleased him so that her beauty filled him
 with love. very craftily he asked erec for permission to speak with her.
 "sire," he says "i ask a favour of you, and may it not displease you. as
 an act of courtesy and as a pleasure, i would fain sit by yonder lady's
 side. with good intent i came to see you both, and you should see no harm
 in that. i wish to present to the lady my service in all respects. know
 well that for love of you i would do whatever may please her." erec was
 not in the least jealous and suspected no evil or treachery. "sire," says
 he, "i have no objection. you may sit down and talk with her. don't think
 that i have any objection. i give you permission willingly." the lady was
 seated about two spear-lengths away from him. and the count took his seat
 close beside her on a low stool. prudent and courteous, the lady turned
 toward him. "alas," quoth he, "how grieved i am to see you in such humble
 state! i am sorry and feel great distress. but if you would believe my
 word, you could have honour and great advantage, and much wealth would
 accrue to you. such beauty as yours is entitled to great honour and
 distinction. i would make you my mistress, if it should please you and be
 your will; you would be my mistress dear and lady over all my land. when i
 deign to woo you thus, you ought not to disdain my suit. i know and
 perceive that your lord does not love and esteem you. if you will remain
 with me, you would be mated with a worthy lord." "sire," says enide, "your
 proposal is vain. it cannot be. ah! better that i were yet unborn, or
 burnt upon a fire of thorns and my ashes scattered abroad than that i
 should ever in any wise be false to my lord, or conceive any felony or
 treachery toward him. you have made a great mistake in making such a
 proposal to me. i shall not agree to it in any wise." the count's ire
 began to rise. "you disdain to love me, lady?" says he; "upon my word, you
 are too proud. neither for flattery nor for prayer you will do my will? it
 is surely true that a woman's pride mounts the more one prays and flatters
 her; but whoever insults and dishonours her will often find her more
 tractable. i give you my word that if you do not do my will there soon
 will be some sword-play here. rightly or wrongly, i will have your lord
 slain right here before your eyes." "ah, sire," says enide, "there is a
 better way than that you say. you would commit a wicked and treacherous
 deed if you killed him thus. calm yourself again, i pray; for i will do
 your pleasure. you may regard me as all your own, for i am yours and wish
 to be. i did not speak as i did from pride, but to learn and prove if i
 could find in you the true love of a sincere heart. but i would not at any
 price have you commit an act of treason. my lord is not on his guard; and
 if you should kill him thus, you would do a very ugly deed, and i should
 have the blame for it. every one in the land would say that it had been
 done with my consent. go and rest until the morrow, when my lord shall be
 about to rise. then you can better do him harm without blame and without
 reproach." with her heart's thoughts her words do not agree. "sire," says
 she, "believe me now! have no anxiety; but send here to-morrow your
 knights and squires and have me carried away by force. my lord will rush
 to my defence, for he is proud and bold enough. either in earnest or in
 jest, have him seized and treated ill, or strike his head off, if you
 will. i have led this life now long enough; to tell the truth. i like not
 the company of this my lord. rather would i feel your body lying beside me
 in a bed. and since we have reached this point, of my love you may rest
 assured." the count replies: "it is well, my lady! god bless the hour that
 you were born; in great estate you shall be held." "sire," says she,
 "indeed, i believe it. and yet i would fain have your word that you will
 always hold me dear; i could not believe you otherwise." glad and merry,
 the count replies: "see here, my faith i will pledge to you loyally as a
 count, madame, that i shall do all your behests. have no further fear of
 that. all you want you shall always have." then she took his plighted
 word; but little she valued or cared for it, except therewith to save her
 lord. well she knows how to deceive a fool, when she puts her mind upon
 it. better it were to lie to him than that her lord should be cut off. the
 count now rose from her side, and commends her to god a hundred times. but
 of little use to him will be the faith which she has pledged to him. erec
 knew nothing at all of this that they were plotting to work his death; but
 god will be able to lend him aid, and i think he will do so. now erec is
 in great peril, and does not know that he must be on his guard. the
 count's intentions are very base in planning to steal away his wife and
 kill him when he is without defence. in treacherous guise he takes his
 leave: "to god i commend you," says he, and erec replies: "and so do i
 you, sire." thus they separated. already a good part of the night was
 passed. out of the way, in one of the rooms, two beds were made upon the
 floor. in one of them erec lays him down, in the other enide went to rest.
 full of grief and anxiety, she never closed her eyes that night, but
 remained on watch for her lord's sake; for from what she had seen of the
 count, she knew him to be full of wickedness. she knows full well that if
 he once gets possession of her lord, he will not fail to do him harm. he
 may be sure of being killed: so for his sake she is in distress. all night
 she must needs keep her vigil; but before the dawn, if she can bring it
 about, and if her lord will take her word, they will be ready to depart.
 (vv. -.) erec slept all night long securely until daylight. then
 enide realised and suspected that she might hesitate too long. her heart
 was tender toward her lord, like a good and loyal lady. her heart was
 neither deceitful nor false. so she rises and makes ready, and drew near
 to her lord to wake him up. "ah, sire," says she, "i crave your pardon.
 rise quickly now, for you are betrayed beyond all doubt, though guiltless
 and free from any crime. the count is a proven traitor, and if he can but
 catch you here, you will never get away without his having cut you in
 pieces. he hates you because he desires me. but if it please god, who
 knows all things, you shall be neither slain nor caught. last evening he
 would have killed you had i not assured him that i would be his mistress
 and his wife. you will see him return here soon: he wants to seize me and
 keep me here and kill you if he can find you." now erec learns how loyal
 his wife is to him. "lady," says he, "have our horses quickly saddled;
 then run and call our host, and tell him quickly to come here. treason has
 been long abroad." now the horses are saddled, and the lady summoned the
 host. erec has armed and dressed himself, and into his presence came the
 host. "sire," said he, "what haste is this, that you are risen at such an
 hour, before the day and the sun appear?" erec replies that he has a long
 road and a full day before him, and therefore he has made ready to set
 out, having it much upon his mind; and he added: "sire, you have nor yet
 handed me any statement of my expenses. you have received me with honour
 and kindness, and therein great merit redounds to you. cancel my
 indebtedness with these seven horses that i brought here with me. do not
 disdain them, but keep them for your own. i cannot increase my gift to you
 by so much as the value of a halter." the burgher was delighted with this
 gift and bowed low, expressing his thanks and gratitude. then erec mounts
 and takes his leave, and they set out upon their way. as they ride, he
 frequently warns enide that if she sees anything she should not be so bold
 as to speak to him about it. meanwhile, there entered the house a hundred
 knights well armed, and very much dismayed they were to find erec no
 longer there. then the count learned that the lady had deceived him. he
 discovered the footsteps of the horses, and they all followed the trail,
 the count threatening erec and vowing that, if he can come up with him,
 nothing can keep him from having his head on the spot. "a curse on him who
 now hangs back, and does not spur on fast!" quoth he; "he who presents me
 with the head of the knight whom i hate so bitterly, will have served me
 to my taste." then they plunge on at topmost speed, filled with hostility
 toward him who had never laid eyes on them and had never harmed them by
 deed or word. they ride ahead until they made him out; at the edge of a
 forest they catch sight of him before he was hid by the forest trees. not
 one of them halted then, but all rushed on in rivalry. enide hears the
 clang and noise of their arms and horses, and sees that the valley is full
 of them. as soon as she saw them, she could not restrain her tongue. "ah,
 sire," she cries, "alas, how this count has attacked you, when he leads
 against you such a host! sire, ride faster now, until we be within this
 wood. i think we can easily distance them, for they are still a long way
 behind. if you go on at this pace, you can never escape from death, for
 you are no match for them." erec replies: "little esteem you have for me,
 and lightly you hold my words. it seems i cannot correct you by fair
 request. but as the lord have mercy upon me until i escape from here, i
 swear that you shall pay dearly for this speech of yours; that is, unless
 my mind should change." then he straightway turns about, and sees the
 seneschal drawing near upon a horse both strong and fleet. before them all
 he takes his stand at the distance of four cross-bow shots. he had not
 disposed of his arms, but was thoroughly well equipped. erec reckons up
 his opponents' strength, and sees there are fully a hundred of them. then
 he who thus is pressing him thinks he had better call a hair. then they
 ride to meet each other, and strike upon each other's shield great blows
 with their sharp and trenchant swords. erec caused his stout steel sword
 to pierce his body through and through, so that his shield and hauberk
 protected him no more than a shred of dark-blue silk. and next the count
 comes spurring on, who, as the story tells, was a strong and doughty
 knight. but the count in this was ill advised when he came with only
 shield and lance. he placed such trust in his own prowess that he thought
 that he needed no other arms. he showed his exceeding boldness by rushing
 on ahead of all his men more than the space of nine acres. when erec saw
 him stand alone, he turned toward him; the count is not afraid of him, and
 they come together with clash of arms. first the count strikes him with
 such violence upon the breast that he would have lost his stirrups if he
 had not been well set. he makes the wood of his shield to split so that
 the iron of his lance protrudes on the other side. but erec's hauberk was
 very solid and protected him from death without the tear of a single mesh.
 the count was strong and breaks his lance; then erec strikes him with such
 force on his yellow painted shield that he ran more than a yard of his
 lance through his abdomen, knocking him senseless from his steed. then he
 turned and rode away without further tarrying on the spot. straight into
 the forest he spurs at full speed. now erec is in the woods, and the
 others paused a while over those who lay in the middle of the field.
 loudly they swear and vow that they will rather follow after him for two
 or three days than fail to capture and slaughter him. the count, though
 grievously wounded in the abdomen, hears what they say. he draws himself
 up a little and opens his eyes a tiny bit. now he realises what an evil
 deed he had begun to execute. he makes the knights step back, and says:
 "my lords, i bid you all, both strong and weak, high and low, that none of
 you be so bold as to dare to advance a single step. all of you return now
 quickly! i have done a villainous deed, and i repent me of my foul design.
 the lady who outwitted me is very honourable, prudent, and courteous. her
 beauty fired me with love for her; because i desired her, i wished to kill
 her lord and keep her back with me by force. i well deserved this woe, and
 now it has come upon me. how abominably disloyal and treacherous i was in
 my madness! never was there a better knight born of mother than he. never
 shall he receive harm through me if i can in any way prevent it. i command
 you all to retrace your steps." back they go disconsolate, carrying the
 lifeless seneschal on the shield reversed. the count, whose wound was not
 mortal, lived on for some time after. thus was erec delivered.
 (vv. -.) erec goes off at full speed down a road between two
 hedgerows—he and his wife with him. both putting spurs to their
 horses, they rode until they came to a meadow which had been mown. after
 emerging from the hedged enclosure they came upon a drawbridge before a
 high tower, which was all closed about with a wall and a broad and deep
 moat. they quickly pass over the bridge, but had not gone far before the
 lord of the place espied them from up in his tower. about this man i can
 tell you the truth: that he was very small of stature, but very courageous
 of heart. when he sees erec cross the bridge, he comes down quickly from
 his tower, and on a great sorrel steed of his he causes a saddle to be
 placed, which showed portrayed a golden lion. then he orders to be brought
 his shield, his stiff, straight lance, a sharp polished sword, his bright
 shining helmet, his gleaming hauberk, and triple-woven greaves; for he has
 seen an armed knight pass before his list against whom he wishes to strive
 in arms, or else this stranger will strive against him until he shall
 confess defeat. his command was quickly done: behold the horse now led
 forth; a squire brought him around already bridled and with saddle on.
 another fellow brings the arms. the knight passed out through the gate, as
 quickly as possible, all alone, without companion. erec is riding along a
 hill-side, when behold the knight comes tearing down over the top of the
 hill, mounted upon a powerful steed which tore along at such a pace that
 he crushed the stones beneath his hoofs finer than a millstone grinds the
 corn; and bright gleaming sparks flew off in all directions, so that it
 seemed as if his four feet were all ablaze with fire. enide heard the
 noise and commotion, and almost fell from her palfrey, helpless and in a
 faint. there was no vein in her body in which the blood did not turn, and
 her face became all pale and white as if she were a corpse. great is her
 despair and dismay, for she does not dare to address her lord, who often
 threatens and chides at her and charges her to hold her peace. she is
 distracted between two courses to pursue, whether to speak or to hold her
 peace. she takes counsel with herself, and often she prepares to speak, so
 that her tongue already moves, but the voice cannot issue forth; for her
 teeth are clenched with fear, and thus shut up her speech within. thus she
 admonishes and reproaches herself, but she closes her mouth and grits her
 teeth so that her speech cannot issue forth. at strife with herself, she
 said: "i am sure and certain that i shall incur a grievous loss, if here i
 lose my lord. shall i tell him all, then, openly? not i. why not? i would
 not dare, for thus i should enrage my lord. and if my lord's ire is once
 aroused, he will leave me in this wild place alone, wretched and forlorn.
 then i shall be worse off than now. worse off? what care i? may grief and
 sorrow always be mine as long as i live, if my lord does not promptly
 escape from here without being delivered to a violent death. but if i do
 not quickly inform him, this knight who is spurring hither will have
 killed him before he is aware; for he seems of very evil intent. i think i
 have waited too long from fear of his vigorous prohibition. but i will no
 longer hesitate because of his restraint. i see plainly that my lord is so
 deep in thought that he forgets himself; so it is fight that i should
 address him." she spoke to him. he threatens her, but has no desire to do
 her harm, for he realises and knows full well that she loves him above all
 else, and he loves her, too, to the utmost. he rides toward the knight,
 who challenges him to battle, and they meet at the foot of the hill, where
 they attack and defy each other. both smite each other with their
 iron-tipped lances with all their strength. the shields that hang about
 their necks are not worth two coats of bark: the leather tears, and they
 split the wood, and they shatter the meshes of the hauberks. both are
 pierced to the vitals by the lances, and the horses fall to earth. now,
 both the warriors were doughty. grievously, but not mortally, wounded,
 they quickly got upon their feet and grasped afresh their lances, which
 were not broken nor the worse for wear. but they cast them away on the
 ground, and drawing their swords from the scabbard, they attack each other
 with great fury. each wounds and injures the other, for there is no mercy
 on either side. they deal such blows upon the helmets that gleaming sparks
 fly out when their swords recoil. they split and splinter the shields;
 they batter and crush the hauberks. in four places the swords are brought
 down to the bare flesh, so that they are greatly weakened and exhausted.
 and if both their swords had lasted long without breaking, they would
 never have retreated, nor would the battle have come to an end before one
 of them perforce had died. enide, who was watching them, was almost beside
 herself with grief. whoever could have seen her then, as she showed her
 great woe by wringing her hands, tearing her hair and shedding tears,
 could have seen a loyal lady. and any man would have been a vulgar wretch
 who saw and did not pity her. and the knights still fight, knocking the
 jewels from the helmets and dealing at each other fearful blows. from the
 third to the ninth hour the battle continued so fierce that no one could
 in any wise make out which was to have the better of it. erec exerts
 himself and strives; he brought his sword down upon his enemy's helmet,
 cleaving it to the inner lining of mail and making him stagger; but he
 stood firmly and did not fall. then he attacked erec in turn, and dealt
 him such a blow upon the covering of his shield that his strong and
 precious sword broke when he tried to pull it out. when he saw that his
 sword was broken, in a spite he threw as far away as he could the part
 that remained in his hand. now he was afraid and must needs draw back; for
 any knight that lacks his sword cannot do much execution in battle or
 assault. erec pursues him until he begs him, for god's sake, not to kill
 him. "mercy, noble knight," he cries, "be not so cruel and harsh toward
 me. now that i am left without my sword, you have the strength and the
 power to take my life or make me your prisoner, for i have no means of
 defence." erec replies: "when thou thus dost petition me i fain would hear
 thee admit outright whether thou art defeated and overcome. thou shalt not
 again be touched by me if thou dost surrender at my discretion." the
 knight was slow to make reply. so, when erec saw him hesitate, in order to
 further dismay him, he again attacked him, rushing at him with drawn
 sword; whereupon, thoroughly terrified, he cried: "mercy, sire! regard me
 as your captive, since it cannot be otherwise." erec answers: "more than
 that is necessary. you shall not get off so easily as that. tell me your
 station and your name, and i in turn will tell you mine." "sire," says he,
 "you are right. i am king of this country. my liegemen are irishmen, and
 there is none who does not have to pay me rent.  my name
 is guivret the little. i am very rich and powerful; for there is no
 landholder whose lands touch mine in any direction who ever transgresses
 my command and who does not do my pleasure. i have no neighbour who does
 not fear me, however proud and bold he may be. but i greatly desire to be
 your confidant and friend from this time on." erec replies: "i, too, can
 boast that i am a noble man. my name is erec, son of king lac. my father
 is king of farther wales, and has many a rich city, fine hall, and strong
 town; no king or emperor has more than he, save only king arthur. him, of
 course, i except; for with him none can compare." guivret is greatly
 astonished at this, and says: "sire, a great marvel is this i hear. i was
 never so glad of anything as of your acquaintance. you may put full trust
 in me! and should it please you to abide in my country within my estates,
 i shall have you treated with great honour. so long as you care to remain
 here, you shall be recognised as my lord. we both have need of a
 physician, and i have a castle of mine near here, not eight leagues away,
 nor even seven. i wish to take you thither with me, and there we shall
 have our wounds tended." erec replies: "i thank you for what i have heard
 you say. however, i will not go, thank you. but only so much i request of
 you, that if i should be in need, and you should hear that i had need of
 aid, you would not then forget me." "sire" says he, "i promise you that
 never, so long as i am alive, shall you have need of my help but that i
 shall go at once to aid you with all the assistance i can command." "i
 have nothing more to ask of you," says erec; "you have promised me much.
 you are now my lord and friend, if your deed is as good as your word."
 then each kisses and embraces the other. never was there such an
 affectionate parting after such a fierce battle; for from very affection
 and generosity each one cut off long, wide strips from the bottom of his
 shirt and bound up the other's wounds. when they had thus bandaged each
 other, they commended each other to god.
 (vv. -.) so thus they parted. guivret takes his way back alone,
 while erec resumed his road, in dire need of plaster wherewith to heal his
 wounds. he did not cease to travel until he came to a plain beside a lofty
 forest all full of stags, hinds, deer, does, and other beasts, and all
 sorts of game. now king arthur and the queen and the best of his barons
 had come there that very day. the king wished to spend three or four days
 in the forest for pleasure and sport, and had commanded tents, pavilions,
 and canopies to be brought. my lord gawain had stepped into the king's
 tent, all tired out by a long ride. in front of the tent a white beech
 stood, and there he had left a shield of his, together with his ashen
 lance. he left his steed, all saddled and bridled, fastened to a branch by
 the rein. there the horse stood until kay the seneschal came by. 
 he came up quickly and, as if to beguile the time, took the steed and
 mounted, without the interference of any one. he took the lance and the
 shield, too, which were close by under the tree. galloping along on the
 steed, kay rode along a valley until it came about by chance that erec met
 him. now erec recognised the seneschal, and he knew the arms and the
 horse, but kay did not recognise him, for he could not be distinguished by
 his arms. so many blows of sword and lance had he received upon his shield
 that all the painted design had disappeared from it. and the lady, who did
 not wish to be seen or recognised by him, shrewdly held her veil before
 her face, as if she were doing it because of the sun's glare and the dust.
 kay approached rapidly and straightway seized erec's rein, without so much
 as saluting him. before he let him move, he presumptuously asked him:
 "knight," says he, "i wish to know who you are and whence you come." "you
 must be mad to stop me thus," says erec; "you shall not know that just
 now." and the other replies: "be not angry; i only ask it for your good. i
 can see and make out clearly that you are wounded and hurt. if you will
 come along with me you shall have a good lodging this night; i shall see
 that you are well cared for, honoured and made comfortable: for you are in
 need of rest. king arthur and the queen are close by here in a wood,
 lodged in pavilions and tents. in all good faith, i advise you to come
 with me to see the queen and king, who will take much pleasure in you and
 will show you great honour." erec replies: "you say well; yet will i not
 go thither for anything. you know not what my business is: i must yet
 farther pursue my way. now let me go; too long i stay. there is still some
 daylight left." kay makes answer: "you speak madness when you decline to
 come. i trow you will repent of it. and however much it may be against
 your will, you shall both go, as the priest goes to the council,
 willy-nilly. to-night you will be badly served, if, unmindful of my
 advice, you go there as strangers. come now quickly, for i will take you."
 at this word erec's ire was roused. "vassal," says he, "you are mad to
 drag me thus after you by force. you have taken me quite off my guard. i
 tell you you have committed an offence. for i thought to be quite safe,
 and was not on my guard against you." then he lays his hand upon his sword
 and cries: "hands off my bridle, vassal! step aside. i consider you proud
 and impudent. i shall strike you, be sure of that, if you drag me longer
 after you. leave me alone now." then he lets him go, and draws off across
 the field more than an acre's width; then turns about and, as a man with
 evil intent, issues his challenge. each rushed at the other. but, because
 kay was without armour, erec acted courteously and turned the point of his
 lance about and presented the butt-end instead. even so, he gave him such
 a blow high up on the broad expanse of his shield that he caused it to
 wound him on the temple, pinning his arm to his breast: all prone he
 throws him to the earth. then he went to catch the horse and hands him
 over by the bridle to enide. he was about to lead it away, when the
 wounded man with his wonted flattery begs him to restore it courteously to
 him. with fair words he flatters and wheedles him. "vassal," says he, "so
 help me god, that horse is not mine. rather does it belong to that knight
 in whom dwells the greatest prowess in the world, my lord gawain the bold.
 i tell you so much on his behalf, in order that you may send it back to
 him and thus win honour. so shall you be courteous and wise, and i shall
 be your messenger." erec makes answer: "take the horse, vassal, and lead
 it away. since it belongs to my lord gawain it is not meet that i should
 appropriate it." kay takes the horse, remounts, and coming to the royal
 tent, tells the king the whole truth, keeping nothing back. and the king
 summoned gawain, saying: "fair nephew gawain, if ever you were true and
 courteous, go quickly after him and ask him in winsome wise who he is and
 what his business. and if you can influence him and bring him along with
 you to us, take care not to fail to do so." then gawain mounts his steed,
 two squires following after him. they soon made erec out, but did not
 recognise him. gawain salutes him, and he gawain: their greetings were
 mutual. then said my lord gawain with his wonted openness: "sire," says
 he, "king arthur sends me along this way to encounter you. the queen and
 king send you their greeting, and beg you urgently to come and spend some
 time with them (it may benefit you and cannot harm), as they are close
 by." erec replies: "i am greatly obliged to the king and queen and to you
 who are, it seems, both kind of heart and of gentle mien. i am not in a
 vigorous state; rather do i bear wounds within my body: yet will i not
 turn aside from my way to seek a lodging-place. so you need not longer
 wait: i thank you, but you may be gone." now gawain was a man of sense. he
 draws back and whispers in the ear of one of the squires, bidding him go
 quickly and tell the king to take measures at once to take down and lower
 his tents and come and set them up in the middle of the road three or four
 leagues in advance of where they now are. there the king must lodge
 to-night, if he wishes to meet and extend hospitality to the best knight
 in truth whom he can ever hope to see; but who will not go out of his way
 for a lodging at the bidding of any one. the fellow went and gave his
 message. the king without delay causes his tents to be taken down. now
 they are lowered, the sumpters loaded, and off they set. the king mounted
 aubagu, and the queen afterwards mounted a white norse palfrey. all this
 while, my lord gawain did not cease to detain erec, until the latter said
 to him: "yesterday i covered more ground than i shall do to-day. sire, you
 annoy me; let me go. you have already disturbed a good part of my day."
 and my lord gawain answers him: "i should like to accompany you a little
 way, if you do not object; for it is yet a long while until night. they
 spent so much time in talking that all the tents were set up before them,
 and erec sees them, and perceives that his lodging is arranged for him.
 "ah! gawain," he says, "your shrewdness has outwitted me. by your great
 cunning you have kept me here. since it has turned out thus, i shall tell
 you my name at once. further concealment would be useless. i am erec, who
 was formerly your companion and friend." gawain hears him and straightway
 embraces him. he raised up his helmet and unlaced his mouthpiece. joyfully
 he clasps him in his embrace, while erec embraces him in turn. then gawain
 leaves him, saying, "sire, this news will give great pleasure to my lord;
 he and my lady will both be glad, and i must go before to tell them of it.
 but first i must embrace and welcome and speak comfortably to my lady
 enide, your wife. my lady the queen has a great desire to see her. i heard
 her speak of her only yesterday." then he steps up to enide and asks her
 how she is, if she is well and in good case. she makes answer courteously:
 "sire, i should have no cause for grief, were i not in great distress for
 my lord; but as it is, i am in dismay, for he has hardly a limb without a
 wound." gawain replies: "this grieves me much. it is perfectly evident
 from his face, which is all pale and colourless. i could have wept myself
 when i saw him so pale and wan, but my joy effaced my grief, for at sight
 of him i felt so glad that i forgot all other pain. now start and ride
 along slowly. i shall ride ahead at top-speed to tell the queen and the
 king that you are following after me. i am sure that they will both be
 delighted when they hear it." then he goes, and comes to the king's tent.
 "sire," he cries, "now you and my lady must be glad, for here come erec
 and his wife." the king leaps to his feet with joy. "upon my word!" he
 says, "right glad i am. i could hear no news which could give me so much
 happiness." the queen and all the rest rejoice, and come out from the
 tents as fast as they may. even the king comes forth from his pavilion,
 and they met erec near at band. when erec sees the king coming, he quickly
 dismounts, and enide too. the king embraces and meets them, and the queen
 likewise tenderly kisses and embraces them: there is no one that does not
 show his joy. right there, upon the spot, they took off erec's armour; and
 when they saw his wounds, their joy turned to sadness. the king draws a
 deep sigh at the sight of them, and has a plaster brought which morgan,
 his sister, had made. this piaster, which morgan had given to arthur, was
 of such sovereign virtue that no wound, whether on nerve or joint,
 provided it were treated with the piaster once a day, could fail to be
 completely cured and healed within a week. they brought to the king the
 piaster which gave erec great relief. when they had bathed, dried, and
 bound up his wounds, the king leads him and enide into his own royal tent,
 saying that he intends, out of love for erec, to tarry in the forest a
 full fortnight, until he be completely restored to health. for this erec
 thanks the king, saying: "fair sire, my wounds are not so painful that i
 should desire to abandon my journey. no one could detain me; to-morrow,
 without delay, i shall wish to get off in the morning, as soon as i see
 the dawn." at this the king shook his head and said: "this is a great
 mistake for you not to remain with us. i know that you are far from well.
 stay here, and you will do the right thing. it will be a great pity and
 cause for grief if you die in this forest. fair gentle friend, stay here
 now until you are quite yourself again." erec replies: "enough of this. i
 have undertaken this journey, and shall not tarry in any wise." the king
 hears that he would by no means stay for prayer of his; so he says no more
 about it, and commands the supper to be prepared at once and the tables to
 be spread. the servants go to make their preparations. it was a saturday
 night; so they ate fish and fruit, pike and perch, salmon and trout, and
 then pears both raw and cooked.  soon
 after supper they ordered the beds to be made ready. the king, who held
 erec dear, had him laid in a bed alone; for he did not wish that any one
 should lie with him who might touch his wounds. that night he was well
 lodged. in another bed close by lay enide with the queen under a cover of
 ermine, and they all slept in great repose until the day broke next
 morning.
 (vv. -.) next day, as soon as it is dawn. erec arises, dresses,
 commands his horses to be saddled, and orders his arms to be brought to
 him. the valets run and bring them to him. again the king and all the
 knights urge him to remain; but entreaty is of no avail, for he will not
 stay for anything. then you might have seen them all weep and show such
 grief as if they already saw him dead. he puts on his arms, and enide
 arises. all the knights are sore distressed, for they think they will
 never see them more. they follow them out from the tents, and send for
 their own horses, that they may escort and accompany them. erec said to
 them: "be not angry! but you shall not accompany me a single step. i'll
 thank you if you'll stay behind!" his horse was brought to him, and he
 mounts without delay. taking his shield and lance, he commends them all to
 god, and they in turn wish erec well. then enide mounts, and they ride
 away.
 (vv. -.) entering a forest, they rode on without halting till hour
 of prime. while they thus traversed the wood, they heard in the distance
 the cry of a damsel in great distress. when erec heard the cry, he felt
 sure from the sound that it was the voice of one in trouble and in need of
 help. straightway calling enide, he says: "lady, there is some maiden who
 goes through the wood calling aloud. i take it that she is in need of aid
 and succour. i am going to hasten in that direction and see what her
 trouble is. do you dismount and await me here, while i go yonder."
 "gladly, sire," she says. leaving her alone, he makes his way until he
 found the damsel, who was going through the wood, lamenting her lover whom
 two giants had taken and were leading away with very cruel treatment. the
 maiden was rending her garments, and tearing her hair and her tender
 crimson face. erec sees her and, wondering greatly, begs her to tell him
 why she cries and weeps so sore. the maiden cries and sighs again, then
 sobbing, says: "fair sire, it is no wonder if i grieve, for i wish i were
 dead. i neither love nor prize my life, for my lover has been led away
 prisoner by two wicked and cruel giants who are his mortal enemies. god!
 what shall i do? woe is me! deprived of the best knight alive, the most
 noble and the most courteous. and now he is in great peril of death. this
 very day, and without cause, they will bring him to some vile death. noble
 knight, for god's sake, i beg you to succour my lover, if now you can lend
 him any aid. you will not have to run far, for they must still be close
 by." "damsel," says erec, "i will follow them, since you request it, and
 rest assured that i shall do all within my power: either i shall be taken
 prisoner along with him, or i shall restore him to you safe and sound. if
 the giants let him live until i can find him, i intend to measure my
 strength with theirs." "noble knight," the maiden said, "i shall always be
 your servant if you restore to me my lover. now go in god's name, and make
 haste, i beseech you." "which way lies their path?" "this way, my lord.
 here is the path with the footprints." then erec started at a gallop, and
 told her to await him there. the maid commends him to the lord, and prays
 god very fervently that he should give him force by his command to
 discomfit those who intend evil toward her lover.
 (vv. -.) erec went off along the trail, spurring his horse in
 pursuit of the giants. he followed in pursuit of them until he caught
 sight of them before they emerged from the wood; he saw the knight with
 bare limbs mounted naked on a nag, his hands and feet bound as if he were
 arrested for highway robbery. the giants had no lances, shields or whetted
 swords; but they both had clubs and scourges, with which they were beating
 him so cruelly that already they had cut the skin on his back to the bone.
 down his sides and flanks the blood ran, so that the nag was all covered
 with blood down to the belly.  erec
 came along alone after them. he was very sad and distressed about the
 knight whom he saw them treat so spitefully. between two woods in an open
 field he came up with them, and asks: "my lords," says he, "for what crime
 do you treat this man so ill and lead him along like a common thief? you
 are treating him too cruelly. you are driving him just as if he had been
 caught stealing. it is a monstrous insult to strip a knight naked, and
 then bind him and beat him so shamefully. hand him over to me, i beg of
 you with all good-will and courtesy. i have no wish to demand him of you
 forcibly." "vassal," they say, "what business is this of yours? you must
 be mad to make any demand of us. if you do not like it, try and improve
 matters." erec replies: "indeed, i like it not, and you shall not lead him
 away so easily. since you have left the matter in my hands, i say whoever
 can get possession of him let him keep him. take your positions. i
 challenge you. you shall not take him any farther before some blows have
 been dealt." "vassal," they reply, "you are mad, indeed, to wish to
 measure your strength with us. if you were four instead of one, you would
 have no more strength against us than one lamb against two wolves." "i do
 not know how it will turn out," erec replies; "if the sky fails and the
 earth melts, then many a lark will be caught. many a man boasts loudly who
 is of little worth. on guard now, for i am going to attack you." the
 giants were strong and fierce, and held in their clenched hands their big
 clubs tipped with iron. erec went at them lance in rest. he fears neither
 of them, in spite of their menace and their pride, and strikes the
 foremost of them through the eye so deep into the brain that the blood and
 brains spurt out at the back of his neck; that one lies dead and his heart
 stops beating. when the other saw him dead, he had reason to be sorely
 grieved. furious, he went to avenge him: with both hands he raised his
 club on high and thought to strike him squarely upon his unprotected head:
 but erec watched the blow, and received it on his shield. even so, the
 giant landed such a blow that it quite stunned him, and almost made him
 fall to earth from his steed. erec covers himself with his shield and the
 giant, recovering himself, thinks to strike again quickly upon his head.
 but erec had drawn his sword, and attacked him with such fierceness that
 the giant was severely handled: he strikes him so hard upon the neck that
 he splits him down to the saddle-bow. he scatters his bowels upon the
 earth, and the body falls full length, split in two halves. the knight
 weeps with joy and, worshipping, praises god who has sent him this aid.
 then erec unbound him, made him dress and arm himself, and mount one of
 the horses; the other he made him lead with his right hand, and asks him
 who he is. and he replied: "noble knight, thou art my liege lord. i wish
 to regard thee as my lord, as by right i ought to do, for thou hast saved
 my life, which but now would have been cut off from my body with great
 torment and cruelty. what chance, fair gentle sire, in god's name, guided
 thee hither to me, to free me by thy courage from the hands of my enemies?
 sire, i wish to do thee homage. henceforth, i shall always accompany thee
 and serve thee as my lord." erec sees that he is disposed to serve him
 gladly, if he may, and says: "friend, for your service i have no desire;
 but you must know that i came hither to succour you at the instance of
 your lady, whom i found sorrowing in this wood. because of you, she
 grieves and moans; for full of sorrow is her heart. i wish to present you
 to her now. as soon as i have reunited you with her, i shall continue my
 way alone; for you have no call to go with me. i have no need cf your
 company; but i fain would know your name." "sire," says he, "as you wish.
 since you desire to know my name, it must not be kept from you. my name is
 cadoc of tabriol: know that thus i am called. but since i must part from
 you. i should like to know, if it may be, who you are and of what land,
 where i may sometime find and search for you, when i shall go a way from
 here." erec replies: "friend, that i will never confide to you. never
 speak of it again; but if you wish to find it out and do me honour in any
 wise go quickly now without delay to my lord, king arthur, who with might
 and main is hunting the stag in yonder wood, as i take it, not five short
 leagues from here. go thither quickly and take him word that you are sent
 to him as a gift by him whom yesterday within his tent he joyfully
 received and lodged. and be careful not to conceal from him from what
 peril i set free both your life and body. i am dearly cherished at the
 court, and if you present yourself in my name you will do me a service and
 honour. there you shall ask who i am; but you cannot know it otherwise."
 "sire," says cadoc, "i will follow your bidding in all respects. you need
 never have any fear that i do not go with a glad heart. i shall tell the
 king the full truth regarding the battle which you have fought on my
 behalf." thus speaking, they continued their way until they came to the
 maiden where erec had left her. the damsel's joy knew no bounds when she
 saw coming her lover whom she never thought to see again. taking him by
 the hand, erec presents him to her with the words: "grieve no longer,
 demoiselle! behold your lover glad and joyous." and she with prudence
 makes reply: "sire, by right you have won us both. yours we should be, to
 serve and honour. but who could ever repay half the debt we owe you?" erec
 makes answer: "my gentle lady, no recompense do i ask of you. to god i now
 commend you both, for too long, methinks, i have tarried here." then he
 turns his horse about, and rides away as fast as he can. cadoc of tabriol
 with his damsel rides off in another direction; and soon he told the news
 to king arthur and the queen.
 (vv. -.) erec continues to ride at great speed to the place where
 enide was awaiting him in great concern, thinking that surely he had
 completely deserted her. and he, too, was in great fear lest some one,
 finding her alone, might have carried her off. so he made all haste to
 return. but the heat of the day was such, and his arms caused him such
 distress, that his wounds broke open and burst the bandages. his wounds
 never stopped bleeding before he came directly to the spot where enide was
 waiting for him. she espied him and rejoiced: but she did not realise or
 know the pain from which he was suffering; for all his body was bathed in
 blood, and his heart hardly had strength to beat. as he was descending a
 hill he fell suddenly over upon his horse's neck. as he tried to
 straighten up, he lost his saddle and stirrups, falling, as if lifeless,
 in a faint. then began such heavy grief, when enide saw him fall to earth.
 full of fear at the sight of him, she runs toward him like one who makes
 no concealment of her grief. aloud she cries, and wrings her hands: not a
 shred of her robe remains untorn across her breast. she begins to tear her
 hair and lacerate her tender face.  "ah
 god!" she cries, "fair gentle lord, why dost thou let me thus live on?
 come death, and kill me hastily!" with these words she faints upon his
 body. when she recovered, she said to herself reproachfully: "woe is me,
 wretched enide; i am the murderer of my lord, in having killed him by my
 speech. my lord would still be now alive, if i in my mad presumption had
 not spoken the word which engaged him in this adventure. silence never
 harmed any one, but speech often worketh woe. the truth of this i have
 tried and proved in more ways than one." beside her lord she took her
 seat, holding his head upon her lap. then she begins her dole anew.
 "alas," she says, "my lord, unhappy thou, thou who never hadst a peer; for
 in thee was beauty seen and prowess was made manifest; wisdom had given
 thee its heart, and largess set a crown upon thee, without which no one is
 esteemed. but what did i say? a grievous mistake i made in uttering the
 word which has killed my lord—that fatal poisoned word for which i
 must justly be reproached; and i recognise and admit that no one is guilty
 but myself; i alone must be blamed for this." then fainting she falls upon
 the ground, and when she later sat up again, she only moans again the
 more: "god, what shall i do, and why live on? why does death delay and
 hesitate to come and seize me without respite? truly, death holds me in
 great contempt! since death does not deign to take my life, i must myself
 perforce achieve the vengeance for my sinful deed. thus shall i die in
 spite of death, who will not heed my call for aid. yet, i cannot die
 through mere desire, nor would complaining avail me aught. the sword,
 which my lord had gilded on, ought by right to avenge his death. i will
 not longer consume myself in distress, in prayer, and vain desire." she
 draws the sword forth from its sheath and begins to consider it. god, who
 is full of mercy, caused her to delay a little; and while she passes in
 review her sorrow and her misfortune, behold there comes riding apace a
 count with numerous suite, who from afar had heard the lady's loud outcry.
 god did not wish to desert her; for now she would have killed herself, had
 she not been surprised by those who took away from her the sword and
 thrust it back into its sheath. the count then dismounted from his horse
 and began to inquire of her concerning the knight, and whether she was his
 wife or his lady-love. "both one and the other, sire," she says, "my
 sorrow is such as i cannot tell. woe is me that i am not dead." and the
 count begins to comfort her: "lady," he says, "by the lord, i pray you, to
 take some pity on yourself! it is meet that you should mourn, but it is no
 use to be disconsolate; for you may yet rise to high estate. do not sink
 into apathy, but comfort yourself; that will be wise, and god will give
 you joy again. your wondrous beauty holds good fortune in store for you;
 for i will take you as my wife, and make you a countess and dame of rank:
 this ought to bring you much consolation. and i shall have the body
 removed and laid away with great honour. leave off now this grief of yours
 which in your frenzy you display." and she replies: "sire, begone! for
 god's sake, let me be! you can accomplish nothing here. nothing that one
 could say or do could ever make me glad again." at this the count drew
 back and said: "let us make a bier, whereon to carry away this body with
 the lady to the town of limors. there the body shall be interred. then
 will i espouse the lady, whether or not she give consent: for never did i
 see any one so fair, nor desire any as i do her. happy i am to have met
 with her. now make quickly and without delay a proper bier for this dead
 knight. halt not for the trouble, nor from sloth." then some of his men
 draw out their swords and soon cut two saplings, upon which they laid
 branches cross-wise. upon this litter they laid erec down; then hitched
 two horses to it. enide rides alongside, not ceasing to make lament, and
 often fainting and falling back; but the horsemen hold her tight, and try
 to support her with their arms, and raise her up and comfort her. all the
 way to limors they escort the body, until they come to the palace of the
 count. all the people follow up after them—ladies, knights, and
 townspeople. in the middle off the hall upon a dais they stretched the
 body out full length, with his lance and shield alongside. the hall is
 full, the crowd is dense. each one is anxious to inquire what is this
 trouble, what marvel here. meanwhile the count takes counsel with his
 barons privily. "my lords," he says, "upon the spot i wish to espouse this
 lady here. we can plainly judge by her beauty and prudent mien that she is
 of very gentle rank. her beauty and noble bearing show that the honour of
 a kingdom or empire might well be bestowed upon her. i shall never suffer
 disgrace through her; rather i think to win more honour. have my chaplain
 summoned now, and do you go and fetch the lady. the half of all my land i
 will give her as her dower if she will comply with my desire." then they
 bade the chaplain come, in accordance with the count's command, and the
 dame they brought there, too, and made her marry him perforce; for she
 flatly refused to give consent. but in spite of all, the count married her
 in accordance with his wish. and when he had married her, the constable at
 once had the tables set in the palace, and had the food prepared; for
 already it was time for the evening meal.
 (vv. -.) after vespers, that day in may, enide was in sore
 distress, nor did her grief cease to trouble her. and the count urged her
 mildly by prayer and threat to make her peace and be consoled, and he made
 her sit down upon a chair, though it was against her will. in spite of
 her, they made her take a seat and placed the table in front of her. the
 count takes his place on the other side, almost beside himself with rage
 to find that he cannot comfort her. "lady," he says, "you must now leave
 off this grief and banish it. you can have full trust in me, that honour
 and riches will be yours. you must surely realise that mourning will not
 revive the dead; for no one ever saw such a thing come about. remember
 now, though poor you were, that great riches are within your reach. once
 you were poor; rich now you will be. fortune has not been stingy toward
 you, in bestowing upon you the honour of being henceforth hailed as
 countess. it is true that your lord is dead. if you grieve and lament
 because of this, do you think that i am surprised? nay. but i am giving
 you the best advice i know how to give. in that i have married you, you
 ought to be content. take care you do not anger me! eat now, as i bid you
 do." and she replies: "not i, my lord. in faith, as long as i live i will
 neither eat nor drink unless i first see my lord eat who is lying on
 yonder dais" "lady, that can never be. people will think that you are mad
 when you talk such great nonsense. you will receive a poor reward if you
 give occasion to-day for further reproof." to this she vouchsafed no
 reply, holding his threats in slight esteem, and the count strikes her
 upon the face. at this she shrieks, and the barons present blame the
 count. "hold, sire!" they cry to the count; "you ought to be ashamed of
 having struck this lady because she will not eat. you have done a very
 ugly deed. if this lady is distressed because of her lord whom she now
 sees dead, no one should say that she is wrong." "keep silence, all." the
 count replies; "the dame is mine and i am hers, and i will do with her as
 i please." at this she could not hold her peace, but swears she will never
 be his. and the count springs up and strikes her again, and she cries out
 aloud. "ha! wretch," she says, "i care not what thou say to me, or what
 thou do! i fear not thy blows, nor yet thy threats. beat me and strike me,
 as thou wilt. i shall never heed thy power so much as to do thy bidding
 more or less, even were thou with thy hands fight now to snatch out my
 eyes or flay me alive."
 (vv. -.) in the midst of these words and disputes erec recovered
 from his swoon, like a man who awakes from sleep. no wonder that he was
 amazed at the crowd of people he saw around. but great was his grief and
 great his woe when he heard the voice of his wife. he stepped to the floor
 from off the dais and quickly drew his sword. wrath and the love he bore
 his wife gave him courage. he runs thither where he sees her, and strikes
 the count squarely upon the head, so that he beats out his brains and,
 knocking in his forehead, leaves him senseless and speechless; his blood
 and brains flow out. the knights spring from the tables, persuaded that it
 is the devil who had made his way among them there. of young or old there
 none remains, for all were thrown in great dismay. each one tries to
 outrun the other in beating a hasty retreat. soon they were all clear of
 the palace, and cry aloud, both weak and strong: "flee, flee, here comes
 the corpse!" at the door the press is great: each one strives to make his
 escape, and pushes and shoves as best he may. he who is last in the
 surging throng would fain get into the foremost line. thus they make good
 their escape in flight, for one dares not stand upon another's going. erec
 ran to seize his shield, hanging it about his neck by the strap, while
 enide lays hands upon the lance. then they step out into the courtyard.
 there is no one so bold as to offer resistance; for they did not believe
 it could be a man who had thus expelled them, but a devil or some enemy
 who had entered the dead body. erec pursues them as they flee, and finds
 outside in the castle-yard a stable-boy in the act of leading his steed to
 the watering-place, all equipped with bridle and saddle. this chance
 encounter pleased erec well: as he steps up quickly to the horse, the boy
 in fear straightway yields him up. erec takes his seat between the
 saddle-bows, while enide, seizing the stirrup, springs up on to the
 horse's neck, as erec, who bade her mount, commanded and instructed her to
 do. the horse bears them both away; and finding open the town gate, they
 make their escape without detention. in the town there was great anxiety
 about the count who had been killed; but there is no one, however brave,
 who follows erec to take revenge. at his table the count was slain; while
 erec, who bears his wife away, embraces and kisses and gives her cheer. in
 his arms he clasps her against his heart, and says: "sweet sister mine, my
 proof of you has been complete! be no more concerned in any wise, for i
 love you now more than ever i did before; and i am certain and rest
 assured that you love me with a perfect love. from this time on for
 evermore, i offer myself to do your will just as i used to do before. and
 if you have spoken ill of me, i pardon you and call you quit of both the
 offence and the word you spoke." then he kisses her again and clasps her
 tight. now enide is not ill at ease when her lord clasps and kisses her
 and tells her again that he loves her still. rapidly through the night
 they ride, and they are very glad that the moon shines bright.
 (vv. -.) meanwhile, the news has travelled fast, and there is
 nothing else so quick. the news had reached guivret the little that a
 knight wounded with arms had been found dead in the forest, and that with
 him was a lady making moan, and so wondrous fair that iseut would have
 seemed her waiting-maid. count oringle of limors had found them both, and
 had caused the corpse to be borne away, and wished himself to espouse the
 lady; but she refused him. when guivret heard this news, he was by no
 means pleased; for at once the thought of erec occurred to him. it came
 into his heart and mind to go and seek out the lady, and to have the body
 honourably interred, if it should turn out to be he. he assembled a
 thousand men-at-arms and knights to take the town. if the count would not
 surrender of his own accord the body and the lady, he would put all to
 fire and flame. in the moonlight shining clear he led his men on toward
 limors, with helmets laced, in hauberks clad, and from their necks the
 shields were hung. thus, under arms, they all advanced until nearly
 midnight, when erec espied them. now he expects to be ensnared or killed
 or captured inevitably. he makes enide dismount beside a thicket-hedge. no
 wonder if he is dismayed. "lady, do you stay here," he says, "beside this
 thicket-hedge a while, until these people shall have passed. i do not wish
 them to catch sight of you, for i do not know what manner of people they
 are, nor of what they go in search. i trust we may not attract their
 attention. but i see nowhere any place where we could take refuge, should
 they wish to injure us. i know not if any harm may come to me, but not
 from fear shall i fail to sally out against them. and if any one assails
 me, i shall not fail to joust with him. yet, i am so sore and weary that
 it is no wonder if i grieve. now to meet them i must go, and do you stay
 quiet here. take care that no one see you, until they shall have left you
 far behind." behold now guivret, with lance outstretched, who espied him
 from afar. they did not recognise each other, for the moon had gone behind
 the shadow of a dark cloud. erec was weak and exhausted, and his
 antagonist was quite recovered from his wounds and blows. now erec will be
 far from wise if he does not promptly make himself known. he steps out
 from the hedge. and guivret spurs toward him without speaking to him at
 all, nor does erec utter a word to him: he thought he could do more than
 he could. whoever tries to run farther than he is able must perforce give
 up or take a rest. they clash against each other; but the fight was
 unequal, for one was weak and the other strong. guivret strikes him with
 such force that he carries him down to earth from his horse's back. enide,
 who was in hiding, when she sees her lord on the ground, expects to be
 killed and badly used. springing forth from the hedge, she runs to help
 her lord. if she grieved before, now her anguish is greater. coming up to
 guivret, she seized his horse's rein, and then said: "cursed be thou,
 knight! for thou hast attacked a weak and exhausted man, who is in pain
 and mortally wounded, with such injustice that thou canst not find reason
 for thy deed. if thou hadst been alone and helpless, thou wouldst have
 rued this attack, provided my lord had been in health. now be generous and
 courteous, and kindly let cease this battle which thou hast begun. for thy
 reputation would be no better for having killed or captured a knight who
 has not the strength to rise, as thou canst see. for he has suffered so
 many blows of arms that he is all covered with wounds" and he replies:
 "fear not, lady! i see that loyally you love your lord, and i commend you
 for it. have no fear whatsoever of me or of my company. but tell me now
 without concealment what is the name of your lord; for only advantage will
 you get from telling me. whoever he be, tell me his name; then he shall go
 safe and unmolested. neither he nor you have aught to fear, for you are
 both in safe hands."
 (vv. -.) then enide learns that she is safe, she answers him
 briefly in a word: "his name is erec; i ought not to lie, for i see you
 are honest and of good intent." guivret, in his delight, dismounts and
 goes to fall at erec's feet, where he was lying on the ground. "my lord,"
 he says, "i was going to seek for you, and was on my way to limors, where
 i expected to find you dead. it was told and recounted to me as true that
 count oringle had carried off to limors a knight who was mortally wounded,
 and that he wickedly intended to marry a lady whom he had found in his
 company; but that she would have nothing to do with him. and i was coming
 urgently to aid and deliver her. if he refused to hand over to me both the
 lady and you without resistance, i should esteem myself of little worth if
 i left him a foot of earth to stand upon. be sure that had i not loved you
 dearly i should never have taken this upon myself. i am guivret, your
 friend; but if i have done you any hurt through my failure to recognise
 you, you surely ought to pardon me." at this erec sat up, for he could do
 no more, and said: "rise up, my friend. be absolved of the harm you have
 done me, since you did not recognise me." guivret gets up, and erec tells
 him how he has killed the count while he sat at meat, and how he had
 gained possession again of his steed in front of the stable, and how the
 sergeants and the squires had fled across the yard, crying: "flee, flee,
 the corpse is chasing us;" then, how he came near being caught, and how he
 escaped through the town and down the hill, carrying his wife on his
 horse's neck: all this adventure of his he told him. then guivret said,
 "sire, i have a castle here close by, which is well placed in a healthful
 site. for your comfort and benefit i wish to take you there to-morrow and
 have your wounds cared for. i have two charming and sprightly sisters who
 are skilful in the care of wounds: they will soon completely cure you. 
 to-night we shall let our company lodge here in the fields until morning;
 for i think a little rest to-night will do you much good. my advice is
 that we spend the night here." erec replies: "i am in favour of doing so."
 so there they stayed and spent the night. they were not reluctant to
 prepare a lodging-place, but they found few accommodations, for the
 company was quite numerous. they lodge as best they may among the bushes:
 guivret had his tent set up, and ordered tinder to be kindled, that they
 might have light and cheer. he has tapers taken out from the boxes, and
 they light them within the tent. now enide no longer grieves, for all has
 turned out well. she strips her lord of his arms and clothes, and having
 washed his wounds, she dried them and bound them up again; for she would
 let no one else touch him. now erec knows no further reason to reproach
 her, for he has tried her well and found that she bears great love to him.
 and guivret, who treats them kindly, had a high, long bed constructed of
 quilted coverlids, laid upon grass and reed, which they found in
 abundance. there they laid erec and covered him up. then guivret opened a
 box and took out two patties. "friend," says he, "now try a little of
 these cold patties, and drink some wine mixed with water. i have as much
 as six barrels of it, but undiluted it is not good for you; for you are
 injured and covered with wounds. fair sweet friend, now try to eat; for it
 will do you good. and my lady will eat some too—your wife who has
 been to-day in sore distress on your account. but you have received full
 satisfaction for all that, and have escaped. so eat now, and i will eat
 too, fair friend." then guivret sat down by erec's side, and so did enide
 who was much pleased by all that guivret did. both of them urge him to
 eat, giving him wine mixed with water'; for unmixed it is too strong and
 heating. erec ate as a sick man eats, and drank a little—all he
 dared. but he rested comfortably and slept all night; for on his account
 no noise or disturbance was made.
 (vv. -.) in the early morning they awoke, and prepared again to
 mount and ride. erec was so devoted to his own horse that he would ride no
 other. they gave to enide a mule, for she had lost her palfrey. but she
 was not concerned; to judge by her looks, she gave the matter no thought.
 she had a good mule with an easy gait that bore her very comfortably. and
 it gave her great satisfaction that erec was not cast down, but rather
 assured them that he would recover completely. before the third hour they
 reached penevric, a strong castle, well and handsomely situated. there
 dwelt the two sisters of guivret; for the place was agreeable enough.
 guivret escorted erec to a delightful, airy room in a remote part of the
 castle. his sisters, at his request, exerted themselves to cure erec; and
 erec placed himself in their hands, for they inspired him with perfect
 confidence. first, they removed the dead flesh, then applied plaster and
 lint, devoting to his care all their skill, like women who knew their
 business well. again and again they washed his wounds and applied the
 plaster. four times or more each day they made him eat and drink, allowing
 him, however, no garlic or pepper. but whoever might go in or out enide
 was always with him, being more than any one else concerned. guivret often
 came in to ask and inquire if he wanted anything. he was well kept and
 well served, and everything that he wished was willingly done. but the
 damsels cheerfully and gladly showed such devotion in caring for him that
 by the end of a fortnight he felt no hurt or pain. then, to bring his
 colour back, they began to give him baths. there was no need to instruct
 the damsels, for they understood the treatment well. when he was able to
 walk about. guivret had two loose gowns made of two different kinds of
 silk, one trimmed with ermine, the other with vair. one was of a dark
 purple colour, and the other striped, sent to him as a present by a cousin
 of his from scotland. enide had the purple gown trimmed with ermine, which
 was very precious, while erec had the striped stuff with the fur, which
 was no less valuable. now erec was strong and well, cured and recovered.
 now that enide was very happy and had everything she desired, her great
 beauty returned to her; for her great distress had affected her so much
 that she was very pale and wan. now she was embraced and kissed, now she
 was blessed with all good things, now she had her joy and pleasures; for
 unadorned they lie in bed and each enfolds and kisses the other; nothing
 gives them so much joy. they have had so much pain and sorrow, he for her,
 and she for him, that now they have their satisfaction. each vies in
 seeking to please the other. of their further sport i must not speak. now
 they have so welded their love and forgotten their grief that they
 scarcely remember it any more. but now they must go on their way; so they
 asked his leave to depart from guivret, in whom they had found a friend
 indeed; for he had honoured and served them in every way. when he came to
 take leave, erec said: "sire, i do not wish to delay longer my departure
 for my own land. order everything to be prepared and collected, in order
 that i may have all i need. i shall wish to start to-morrow morning, as
 soon as it is day. i have stayed so long with you that i feel strong and
 vigorous. god grant, if it please him, that i may live to meet you again
 somewhere, when i may be able in my turn to serve and honour you. unless i
 am captured or detained, i do not expect to tarry anywhere until i reach
 the court of king arthur, whom i hope to find either at robais or
 carduel." to which guivret makes prompt reply, "sire, you shall not go off
 alone! for i myself shall go with you and shall take companions with us,
 if it be your pleasure." erec accedes to this advice, and says that, in
 accordance with his plans, he wishes the journey to be begun. that night
 they make preparations for their journey, not wishing to delay there
 longer. they all make ready and prepare. in the early morning, when they
 awake, the saddles are placed upon the steeds. before he leaves, erec goes
 to bid farewell to the damsels in their rooms; and enide (who was glad and
 full of joy) thither follows him. when their preparations for departure
 were made, they took their leave of the damsels. erec, who was very
 courteous, in taking leave of them, thanks them for his health and life,
 and pledges to them his service. then he took one of them by the hand she
 who was the nearer to him and enide took the other's hand: hand in hand
 they came up from the bedroom into the castle hall. guivret urges them to
 mount at once without delay. enide thinks the time will never come for
 them to mount. they bring around to the block for her a good-tempered
 palfrey, a soft stepper, handsome and well shaped. the palfrey was of fine
 appearance and a good mount: it was no less valuable than her own which
 had stayed behind at limors. that other one was dappled, this one was
 sorrel; but the head was of another colour: it was marked in such a way
 that one cheek was all white, while the other was raven black. between the
 two colours there was a line, greener than a grape-vine leaf, which
 separated the white from the black. of the bridle, breast-strap, and
 saddle i can surely say that the workmanship was rich and handsome. all
 the breast-strap and bridle was of gold set with emeralds. the saddle was
 decorated in another style, covered with a precious purple cloth. the
 saddle-bows were of ivory, on which was carved the story of how aeneas
 came from troy, how at carthage with great joy dido received him to her
 bed, how aeneas deceived her, and how for him she killed herself, how
 aeneas conquered laurentum and all lombardy, of which he was king all his
 life. 
 cunning was the workmanship and well carved, all decorated with fine gold.
 a skilful craftsman, who made it spent more than seven years in carving
 it, without touching any other piece of work. i do not know whether he
 sold it; but he ought to have obtained a good price for it. now that enide
 was presented with this palfrey, she was well compensated for the loss of
 her own. the palfrey, thus richly apparelled, was given to her and she
 mounted it gladly; then the gentlemen and squires quickly mounted too. for
 their pleasure and sport guivret caused to be taken with them rich
 falcons, both young and moulted, many a tercel and sparrow-hawk, and many
 a setter and greyhound.
 (vv. -.)  they rode straight on from
 morn till eve more than thirty welsh leagues, and then came to the towers
 of a stronghold, rich and fair, girt all about with a new wall. and all
 around, beneath this wall, ran a very deep stream, roaring rushing like a
 storm. erec stops to look at it, and ask and find out if any one could
 truly tell him who was the lord of this town. "friend," said he to his
 kind companion, "could you tell me the name of this town, and whose it is?
 tell me if it belongs to a count or a king. since you have brought me
 here, tell me, if you know." "sire," he says, "i know very well, and will
 tell you the truth about it. the name of the town is brandigant, and it is
 so strong and fine that it fears neither king nor emperor. if france, and
 all of england, and all who live from here to liege were ranged about to
 lay a siege, they would never take it in their lives; for the isle on
 which the town stands stretches away four leagues or more, and within the
 enclosure grows all that a rich town needs: fruit and wheat and wine are
 found; and of wood and water there is no lack. it fears no assault on any
 side, nor could anything reduce it to starvation. king evrain had it
 fortified, and he has possessed it all his days unmolested, and will
 possess it all his life. but not because he feared any one did he thus
 fortify it; but the town is more pleasing so. for if it had no wall or
 tower, but only the stream that encircles it, it would still be so secure
 and strong that it would have no fear of the whole world." "god!" said
 erec, "what great wealth! let us go and see the fortress, and we shall
 take lodging in the town, for i wish to stop here." "sire," said the other
 in great distress, "were it not to disappoint you, we should not stop
 here. in the town there is a dangerous passage." "dangerous?" says erec;
 "do you know about it? whatever it be, tell us about it; for very gladly
 would i know." "sire," says he, "i should fear that you might suffer some
 harm there. i know there is so much boldness and excellence in your heart
 that, were i to tell you what i know of the perilous and hard adventure,
 you would wish to enter in. i have often heard the story, and more than
 seven years have passed since any one that went in quest of the adventure
 has come back from the town; yet, proud, bold knights have come hither
 from many a land. sire, do not treat this as a jest: for you will never
 learn the secret from me until you shall have promised me, by the love you
 have sworn to me, that never by you will be undertaken this adventure,
 from which no one escapes without receiving shame or death."
 (vv. -.) now erec hears what pleases him, and begs guivret not to
 be grieved, saying: "ah, fair sweet friend, permit that our lodging be
 made in the town, and do not be disturbed. it is time to halt for the
 night, and so i trust that it will not displease you; for if any honour
 comes to us here you ought to be very glad. i appeal to you conceding the
 adventure that you tell me just the name of it, and i'll not insist upon
 the rest." "sire." he says, "i cannot be silent and refuse the information
 you desire. the name is very fair to say, but the execution is very hard:
 for no one can come from it alive. the adventure, upon my word, is called
 'the joy of the court.'" "god! there can be nothing but good in joy," says
 erec; "i go to seek it. don't go now and discourage me about this or
 anything else, fair gentle friend; but let us have our lodgings taken, for
 great good may come to us of this. nothing could restrain me from going to
 seek the joy." "sire," says he, "god grant your prayer, that you may find
 joy and return without mishap. i clearly see that we must go in. since
 otherwise it may not be, let us go in. our lodging is secured; for no
 knight of high degree, as i have heard it said and told, can enter this
 castle with intent to lodge here but that king evrain offers to shelter
 him. so gentle and courteous is the king that he has given notice to all
 his townsmen, appealing to their love for him, that any gentleman from
 afar should not find lodging in their houses, so that he himself may do
 honour to all gentlemen who may wish to tarry here."
 (vv. -.)  thus they proceed toward the
 castle, passing the list and the drawbridge; and when they passed the
 listing-place, the people who were gathered in the streets in crowds see
 erec in all his beauty, and apparently they think and believe that all the
 others are in his train. marvelling much, they stare at him; the whole
 town was stirred and moved, as they take counsel and discuss about him.
 even the maidens at their song leave off their singing and desist, as all
 together they look at him; and because of his great beauty they cross
 themselves, and marvellously they pity him. one to another whispers low:
 "alas! this knight, who is passing, is on his way to the 'joy of the
 court.' he will be sorry before he returns; no one ever came from another
 land to claim the 'joy of the court' who did not receive shame and harm,
 and leave his head there as a forfeit." then, that he may hear their
 words, they cry-aloud: "god defend thee, knight, from harm; for thou art
 wondrously handsome, and thy beauty is greatly to be pitied, for to-morrow
 we shall see it quenched. tomorrow thy death is come; to-morrow thou shalt
 surely die if god does not guard and defend thee." erec hears and
 understands that they are speaking of him through the lower town: more
 than two thousand pitied him; but nothing causes him dismay. he passes on
 without delay, bowing gaily to men and women alike. and they all salute
 him too; and most of them swear with anxiety, fearing more than he does
 himself, for his shame and for his hurt. the mere sight of his
 countenance, his great beauty and his bearing, has so won to him the
 hearts of all, that knights, ladies, and maids alike fear his harm. king
 evrain hears the news that men were arriving at his court who brought with
 them a numerous train, and by his harness it appeared that their leader
 was a count or king. king evrain comes down the street to meet them, and
 saluting them he cries: "welcome to this company, both to the master and
 all his suite. welcome, gentlemen! dismount." they dismounted, and there
 were plenty to receive and take their horses. nor was king evrain backward
 when he saw enide coming; but he straightway saluted her and ran to help
 her to dismount. taking her white and tender hand, he led her up into the
 palace, as was required by courtesy, and honoured her in every way he
 could, for he knew right well what he ought to do, without nonsense and
 without malice. he ordered a chamber to be scented with incense, myrrh,
 and aloes. when they entered, they all complimented king evrain on its
 fine appearance. hand in hand they enter the room, the king escorting them
 and taking great pleasure in them. but why should i describe to you the
 paintings and the silken draperies with which the room was decorated? i
 should only waste time in folly, and i do not wish to waste it, but rather
 to hasten on a little; for he who travels the straight road passes him who
 turns aside; therefore i do not wish to tarry. when the time and hour
 arrived, the king orders supper to be prepared; but i do not wish to stop
 over that if i can find some more direct way. that night they had in
 abundance all that heart desires and craves: birds, venison, and fruit,
 and wines of different sorts. but better than all is a happy cheer! for of
 all dishes the sweetest is a joyful countenance and a happy face. they
 were very richly served until erec suddenly left off eating and drinking,
 and began speaking of what rested most upon his heart: he remembered 'the
 joy', and began a conversation about it in which king evrain joined.
 "sire" says he, "it is time now to tell you what i intend, and why i have
 come here. too long i have refrained from speech, and now can no longer
 conceal my object. i ask you for 'the joy' of the court, for i covet
 nothing else so much. grant it to me, whatever it be, if you are in
 control of it." "in truth, fair friend." the king replies, "i hear you
 speak great nonsense. this is a very parlous thing, which has caused
 sorrow to many a worthy man; you yourself will eventually be killed and
 undone if you will not heed my counsel. but if you were willing to take my
 word, i should advise you to desist from soliciting so grievous a thing in
 which you would never succeed. speak of it no more! hold your peace! it
 would be imprudent on your part not to follow my advice. i am not at all
 surprised that you desire honour and fame; but if i should see you harmed
 or injured in your body i should be distressed at heart. and know well
 that i have seen many a man ruined who solicited this joy. they were never
 any the better for it, but rather did they all die and perish. before
 to-morrow's evening come you may expect a like reward. if you wish to
 strive for the joy, you shall do so, though it grieve me sore. it is
 something from which you are free to retreat and draw back if you wish to
 work your welfare. therefore i tell you, for i should commit treachery and
 do you wrong were i not to tell you all the truth." erec hears him and
 admits that the king with reason counsels him. but the greater the wonder
 and the more perilous the adventure, the more he covets it and yearns for
 it, saying: "sire, i can tell you that i find you a worthy and a loyal
 man, and i can put no blame on you. i wish to undertake this boon, however
 it may fall out with me. the die is cast, for i shall never draw back from
 anything i have undertaken without exerting all my strength before i quit
 the field." "i know that well," the king replied; "you are acting against
 my will. you shall have the joy which you desire. but i am in great
 despair; for i greatly fear you will be undone. but now be assured that
 you shall have what you desire. if you come out of it happily, you will
 have won such great honour that never did man win greater; and may god, as
 i desire, grant you a joyous deliverance."
 (vv. -.) all that night they talked of it, until the beds were
 prepared and they went to rest. in the morning, when it was daylight,
 erec, who was on the watch, saw the clear dawn and the sun, and quickly
 rising, clothed himself. enide again is in distress, very sad and ill at
 ease; all night she is greatly disquieted with the solicitude and fear
 which she felt for her lord, who is about to expose himself to great
 peril. but nevertheless he equips himself, for no one can make him change
 his mind. for his equipment the king sent him, when he arose, arms which
 he put to good use. erec did not refuse them, for his own were worn and
 impaired and in bad state. he gladly accepted the arms and had himself
 equipped with them in the hall. when he was armed, he descends the steps
 and finds his horse saddled and the king who had mounted. every one in the
 castle and in the houses of the town hastened to mount. in all the town
 there remained neither man nor woman, erect or deformed, great or small,
 weak or strong, who is able to go and does not do so. when they start,
 there is a great noise and clamour in all the streets; for those of high
 and low degree alike cry out: "alas, alas! oh knight, the joy that thou
 wishest to win has betrayed thee, and thou goest to win but grief and
 death." and there is not one but says: "god curse this joy! which has been
 the death of so many gentlemen. to-day it will wreak the worst woe that it
 has ever yet wrought." erec hears well and notes that up and down they
 said of him: "alas, alas, ill-starred wert thou, fair, gentle, skilful
 knight! surely it would not be just that thy life should end so soon, or
 that harm should come to wound and injure thee." he hears clearly the
 words and what they said; but notwithstanding, he passes on without
 lowering his head, and without the bearing of a craven. whoever may speak,
 he longs to see and know and understand why they are all in such distress,
 anxiety, and woe. the king leads him without the town into a garden that
 stood near by; and all the people follow after, praying that from this
 trial god may grant him a happy issue. but it is not meet that i should
 pass on, from weariness and exhaustion of tongue, without telling you the
 whole truth about the garden, according as the story runs.
 (vv. -.)  the garden had around it no
 wall or fence except of air: yet, by a spell, the garden was on all sides
 so shut in by the air that nothing could enter there any more than if the
 garden were enclosed in iron, unless it flew in over the top. and all
 through the summer and the winter, too, there were flowers and ripe fruits
 there; and the fruit was of such a nature that it could be eaten inside;
 the danger consisted in carrying it out; for whoever should wish to carry
 out a little would never be able to find the gate, and never could issue
 from the garden until he had restored the fruit to its place. and there is
 no flying bird under heaven, pleasing to man, but it sings there to
 delight and to gladden him, and can be heard there in numbers of every
 kind. and the earth, however far it stretch, bears no spice or root of use
 in making medicine, but it had been planted there, and was to be found in
 abundance. through a narrow entrance the people entered—king evrain
 and all the rest. erec went riding, lance in rest, into the middle of the
 garden, greatly delighting in the song of the birds which were singing
 there; they put him in mind of his joy the thing he most was longing for.
 but he saw a wondrous thing, which might arouse fear in the bravest
 warrior of all whom we know, be it thiebaut the esclavon, 
 or ospinel, or fernagu. for before them, on sharpened stakes, there stood
 bright and shining helmets, and each one had beneath the rim a man's head.
 but at the end there stood a stake where as yet there was nothing but a
 horn. 
 he knows not what this signifies, yet draws not back a step for that;
 rather does he ask the king, who was beside him at the right, what this
 can be. the king speaks and explains to him: "friend," he says, "do you
 know the meaning of this thing that you see here? you must be in great
 terror of it, if you care at all for your own body; for this single stake
 which stands apart, where you see this horn hung up, has been waiting a
 very long time, but we know not for whom, whether for you or someone else.
 take care lest thy head be set up there; for such is the purpose of the
 stake. i had warned you well of that before you came here. i do not expect
 that you will escape hence, but that you will be killed and rent apart.
 for this much we know, that the stake awaits your head. and if it turns
 out that it be placed there, as the matter stands agreed, as soon as thy
 head is fixed upon it another stake will be set up beside it which will
 await the arrival of some one else—i know not when or whom. i will
 tell you nothing of the horn; but never has any one been able to blow it.
 however, he who shall succeed in blowing it his fame and honour will grow
 until it distance all those of his country, and he shall find such renown
 that all will come to do him honour, and will hold him to be the best of
 them all. now there is no more of this matter. have your men withdraw; for
 'the joy' will soon arrive, and will make you sorry, i suspect."
 (vv. -.) meanwhile king evrain leaves his side, and erec stoops
 over before enide, whose heart was in great distress, although she held
 her peace; for grief on lips is of no account unless it also touch the
 heart. and he who well knew her heart, said to her: "fair sister dear,
 gentle, loyal, and prudent lady, i am acquainted with your thoughts. you
 are in fear, i see that well, and yet you do not know for what; but there
 is no reason for your dismay until you shall see that my shield is
 shattered and that my body is wounded, and until you see the meshes of my
 bright hauberk covered with blood, and my helmet broken and smashed, and
 me defeated and weary, so that i can no longer defend myself, but must beg
 and sue for mercy against my will; then you may lament, but now you have
 begun too soon. gentle lady, as yet you know not what this is to be; no
 more do i. you are troubled without cause. but know this truly: if there
 were in me only so much courage as your love inspires, truly i should not
 fear to face any man alive. but i am foolish to vaunt myself; yet i say it
 not from any pride, but because i wish to comfort you. so comfort
 yourself, and let it be! i cannot longer tarry here, nor can you go along
 with me; for, as the king has ordered, i must not take you beyond this
 point." then he kisses her and commends her to god, and she him. but she
 is much chagrined that she cannot follow and escort him, until she may
 learn and see what this adventure is to be, and how he will conduct
 himself. but since she must stay behind and cannot follow him, she remains
 sorrowful and grieving. and he went off alone down a path, without
 companion of any sort, until he came to a silver couch with a cover of
 gold-embroidered cloth, beneath the shade of a sycamore; and on the bed a
 maiden of comely body and lovely face, completely endowed with all beauty,
 was seated all alone. i intended to say no more of her; but whoever could
 consider well all her attire and her beauty might well say that never did
 lavinia of laurentum, who was so fair and comely, possess the quarter of
 her beauty. erec draws near to her, wishing to see her more closely, and
 the onlookers go and sit down under the trees in the orchard. then behold,
 there comes a knight armed with vermilion arms, and he was wondrous tall;
 and if he were not so immeasurably tall, under the heavens there would be
 none fairer than he; but, as every one averred, he was a foot taller than
 any knight he knew. before erec caught sight of him, he cried out:
 "vassal, vassal! you are mad, upon my life, thus to approach my damsel. i
 should say you are not worthy to draw near her. you will pay dearly for
 your presumption, by my head! stand back!" and erec stops and looks at
 him, and the other, too, stood still. neither made advance until erec had
 replied all that he wished to say to him. "friend," he says, "one can
 speak folly as well as good sense. threaten as much as you please, and i
 will keep silence; for in threatening there is no sense. do you know why?
 a man sometimes thinks he has won the game who afterward loses it. so he
 is manifestly a fool who is too presumptuous and who threatens too much.
 if there are some who flee there are plenty who chase, but i do not fear
 you so much that i am going to run away yet. i am ready to make such
 defence, if there is any who wishes to offer me battle, that he will have
 to do his uttermost, or otherwise he cannot escape." "nay," quoth he, "so
 help me god! know that you shall have the battle, for i defy and challenge
 you." and you may know, upon my word, that then the reins were not held
 in. the lances they had were not light, but were big and square; nor were
 they planed smooth, but were rough and strong. upon the shields with
 mighty strength they smote each other with their sharp weapons, so that a
 fathom of each lance passes through the gleaming shields. but neither
 touches the other's flesh, nor was either lance cracked; each one, as
 quickly as he could, draws back his lance, and both rushing together,
 return to the fray. one against the other rides, and so fiercely they
 smite each other that both lances break and the horses fall beneath them.
 but they, being seated on their steeds, sustain no harm; so they quickly
 rise, for they were strong and lithe. they stand on foot in the middle of
 the garden, and straightway attack each other with their green swords of
 german steel, and deal great wicked blows upon their bright and gleaming
 helmets, so that they hew them into bits, and their eyes shoot out flame.
 no greater efforts can be made than those they make in striving and
 toiling to injure and wound each other. both fiercely smite with the
 gilded pommel and the cutting edge. such havoc did they inflict upon each
 other's teeth, cheeks, nose, hands, arms, and the rest, upon temples,
 neck, and throat that their bones all ache. they are very sore and very
 tired; yet they do not desist, but rather only strive the more. sweat, and
 the blood which flows down with it, dim their eyes, so that they can
 hardly see a thing; and very often they missed their blows, like men who
 did not see to wield their swords upon each other. they can scarcely harm
 each other now; yet, they do not desist at all from exercising all their
 strength. because their eyes are so blinded that they completely lose
 their sight, they let their shields fall to the ground, and seize each
 other angrily. each pulls and drags the other, so that they fall upon
 their knees. thus, long they fight until the hour of noon is past, and the
 big knight is so exhausted that his breath quite fails him. erec has him
 at his mercy, and pulls and drags so that he breaks all the lacing of his
 helmet, and forces him over at his feet. he falls over upon his face
 against erec's breast, and has not strength to rise again. though it
 distresses him, he has to say and own: "i cannot deny it, you have beaten
 me; but much it goes against my will. and yet you may be of such degree
 and fame that only credit will redound to me; and insistently i would
 request, if it may be in any way, that i might know your name, and he
 thereby somewhat comforted. if a better man has defeated me, i shall be
 glad, i promise you; but if it has so fallen out that a baser man than i
 has worsted me, then i must feel great grief indeed." "friend, dost thou
 wish to know my name?" says erec; "well, i shall tell thee ere i leave
 here; but it will be upon condition that thou tell me now why thou art in
 this garden. concerning that i will know all what is thy name and what the
 joy; for i am very anxious to hear the truth from beginning to end of it."
 "sire," says he, "fearlessly i will tell you all you wish to know." erec
 no more withholds his name, but says: "didst thou ever hear of king lac
 and of his son erec?" "yea, sire, i knew him well; for i was at his
 father's court for many a day before i was knighted, and, if he had had
 his will, i should never have left him for anything." "then thou oughtest
 to know me well, if thou weft ever with me at the court of my father, the
 king." "then, upon my faith, it has turned out well. now hear who has
 detained me so long in this garden. i will tell the truth in accordance
 with your injunction, whatever it may cost me. that damsel who yonder
 sits, loved me from childhood and i loved her. it pleased us both, and our
 love grew and increased, until she asked a boon of me, but did not tell me
 what it was. who would deny his mistress aught? there is no lover but
 would surely do all his sweet-heart's pleasure without default or guile,
 whenever he can in any way. i agreed to her desire; but when i had agreed,
 she would have it, too, that i should swear. i would have done more than
 that for her, but she took me at my word. i made her a promise, without
 knowing what. time passed until i was made a knight. king evrain, whose
 nephew i am, dubbed me a knight in the presence of many honourable men in
 this very garden where we are. my lady, who is sitting there, at once
 recalled to me my word, and said that i had promised her that i would
 never go forth from here until there should come some knight who should
 conquer me by trial of arms. it was right that i should remain, for rather
 than break my word, i should never have pledged it. since i knew the good
 there was in her, i could nor reveal or show to the one whom i hold most
 dear that in all this i was displeased; for if she had noticed it, she
 would have withdrawn her heart, and i would not have had it so for
 anything that might happen. thus my lady thought to detain me here for a
 long stay; she did not think that there would ever enter this garden any
 vassal who could conquer me. in this way she intended to keep me
 absolutely shut up with her all the days of my life. and i should have
 committed an offence if i had had resort to guile and not defeated all
 those against whom i could prevail; such escape would have been a shame.
 and i dare to assure you that i have no friend so dear that i would have
 feigned at all in fighting with him. never did i weary of arms, nor did i
 ever refuse to fight. you have surely seen the helmets of those whom i
 have defeated and put to death; but the guilt of it is not mine, when one
 considers it aright. i could not help myself, unless i were willing to be
 false and recreant and disloyal. now i have told you the truth, and be
 assured that it is no small honour which you have gained. you have given
 great joy to the court of my uncle and my friends; for now i shall be
 released from here; and because all those who are at the court will have
 joy of it, therefore those who awaited the joy called it 'joy of the
 court'. they have awaited it so long that now it will be granted them by
 you who have won it by your fight. you have defeated and bewitched my
 prowess and my chivalry. now it is right that i tell you my name, if you
 would know it. i am called mabonagrain; but i am not remembered by that
 name in any land where i have been, save only in this region; for never,
 when i was a squire, did i tell or make known my name. sire, you knew the
 truth concerning all that you asked me. but i must still tell you that
 there is in this garden a horn which i doubt not you have seen. i cannot
 issue forth from here until you have blown the horn; but then you will
 have released me, and then the joy will begin. whoever shall hear and give
 it heed no hindrance will detain him, when he shall hear the sound of the
 horn, from coming straight-way to the court. rise up, sire! go quickly
 now! go take the horn right joyfully; for you have no further cause to
 wait; so do that which you must do." now erec rose, and the other rises
 with him, and both approach the horn. erec takes it and blows it, putting
 into it all his strength, so that the sound of it reaches far. greatly did
 enide rejoice when she heard the note, and guivret was greatly delighted
 too. the king is glad, and so are his people; there is not one who is not
 well suited and pleased at this. no one ceases or leaves off from making
 merry and from song. erec could boast that day, for never was such
 rejoicing made; it could not be described or related by mouth of man, but
 i will tell you the sum of it briefly and with few words. the news spreads
 through the country that thus the affair has turned out. then there was no
 holding back from coming to the court. all the people hasten thither in
 confusion, some on foot and some on horse, without waiting for each other.
 and those who were in the garden hastened to remove erec's arms, and in
 emulation they all sang a song about the joy; and the ladies made up a lay
 which they called 'the lay of joy',  but the
 lay is not well known. erec was well sated with joy and well served to his
 heart's desire; but she who sat on the silver couch was not a bit pleased.
 the joy which she saw was not at all to her taste. but many people have to
 keep still and look on at what gives them pain. enide acted graciously;
 because she saw her sitting pensive, alone on the couch, she felt moved to
 go and speak with her and tell her about her affairs and about herself,
 and to strive, if possible, to make her tell in return about herself, if
 it did not cause her too great distress. enide thought to go alone,
 wishing to take no one with her, but some of the most noble and fairest
 dames and damsels followed her out of affection to bear her company, and
 also to comfort her to whom the joy brings great chagrin; for she assumed
 that now her lover would be no longer with her so much as he had been,
 inasmuch as he desired to leave the garden. however disappointing it may
 be, no one can prevent his going away, for the hour and the time have
 come. therefore the tears ran down her face from her eyes. much more than
 i can say was she grieving and distressed; nevertheless she sat up
 straight. but she does not care so much for any of those who try to
 comfort her that she ceases her moan. enide salutes her kindly; but for a
 while the other could not reply a word, being prevented by the sighs and
 sobs which torment and distress her. some time it was before the damsel
 returned her salutation, and when she had looked at her and examined her
 for a while, it seemed that she had seen and known her before. but not
 being very certain of it, she was not slow to inquire from whence she was,
 of what country, and where her lord was born; she inquires who they both
 are. enide replies briefly and tells her the truth, saying: "i am the
 niece of the count who holds sway over lalut, the daughter of his own
 sister; at lalut i was born and brought up." the other cannot help
 smiling, without hearing more, for she is so delighted that she forgets
 her sorrow. her heart leaps with joy which she cannot conceal. she runs
 and embraces enide, saying: "i am your cousin! this is the very truth, and
 you are my father's niece; for he and your father are brothers. but i
 suspect that you do not know and have never heard how i came into this
 country. the count, your uncle, was at war, and to him there came to fight
 for pay knights of many lands. thus, fair cousin, it came about, that with
 these hireling knights there came one who was the nephew of the king of
 brandigan. he was with my father almost a year. that was, i think, twelve
 years ago, and i was still but a little child. he was very handsome and
 attractive. there we had an understanding between us that pleased us both.
 i never had any wish but his, until at last he began to love me and
 promised and swore to me that he would always be my lover, and that he
 would bring me here; that pleased us both alike. he could not wait, and i
 was longing to come hither with him; so we both came away, and no one knew
 of it but ourselves. in those days you and i were both young and little
 girls. i have told you the truth; so now tell me in turn, as i have told
 you, all about your lover, and by what adventure he won you." "fair
 cousin, he married me in such a way that my father knew all about it, and
 my mother was greatly pleased. all our relatives knew it and rejoiced over
 it, as they should do. even the count was glad. for he is so good a knight
 that better cannot be found, and he does not need to prove his honour and
 knighthood, and he is of very gentle birth: i do not think that any can be
 his equal. he loves me much, and i love him more, and our love cannot be
 greater. never yet could i withhold my love from him, nor should i do so.
 for is not my lord the son of a king? for did he not take me when i was
 poor and naked? through him has such honour come to me that never was any
 such vouchsafed to a poor helpless girl. and if it please you, i will tell
 you without lying how i came to be thus raised up; for never will i be
 slow to tell the story." then she told and related to her how erec came to
 lalut; for she had no desire to conceal it. she told her the adventure
 word for word, without omission. but i pass over it now, because he who
 tells a story twice makes his tale now tiresome. while they were thus
 conversing, one lady slipped away alone, who sent and told it all to the
 gentlemen, in order to increase and heighten their pleasure too. all those
 who heard it rejoiced at this news. and when mabonagrain knew it he was
 delighted for his sweetheart because now she was comforted. and she who
 bore them quickly the news made them all happy in a short space. even the
 king was glad for it; although he was very happy before, yet now he is
 still happier, and shows erec great honour. enide leads away her fair
 cousin, fairer than helen, more graceful and charming. now erec and
 mabonagrain, guivret and king evrain, and all the others run to meet them
 and salute them and do them honour, for no one is grudging or holds back.
 mabonagrain makes much of enide, and she of him. erec and guivret, for
 their part, rejoice over the damsel as they all kiss and embrace each
 other. they propose to return to the castle, for they have stayed too long
 in the garden. they are all prepared to go out; so they sally forth
 joyfully, kissing each other on the way. all go out after the king, but
 before they reached the castle, the nobles were assembled from all the
 country around, and all those who knew of the joy, and who could do so,
 came hither. great was the gathering and the press. every one, high and
 low, rich and poor, strives to see erec. each thrusts himself before the
 other, and they all salute him and bow before him, saying constantly: "may
 god save him through whom joy and gladness come to our court! god save the
 most blessed man whom god has ever brought into being!" thus they bring
 him to the court, and strive to show their glee as their hearts dictate.
 breton zithers, harps, and viols sound, fiddles, psalteries, and other
 stringed instruments, and all kinds of music that one could name or
 mention. but i wish to conclude the matter briefly without too long delay.
 the king honours him to the extent of his power, as do all the others
 ungrudgingly. there is no one who does not gladly offer to do his service.
 three whole days the joy lasted, before erec could get away. on the fourth
 he would no longer tarry for any reason they could urge. there was a great
 crowd to accompany him and a very great press when it came to taking
 leave. if he had wished to reply to each one, he would not have been able
 in half a day to return the salutations individually. the nobles he
 salutes and embraces; the others he commends to god in a word, and salutes
 them. enide, for her part, is not silent when she takes leave of the
 nobles. she salutes them all by name, and they in turn do the like. before
 she goes, she kisses her cousin very tenderly and embraces her. then they
 go and the joy is over.
 (vv. -.) they go off and the others return. erec and guivret do
 not tarry, but keep joyfully on their way, until they came in nine days to
 robais, where they were told the king was. the day before he had been bled
 privately in his apartments; with him he had only five hundred nobles of
 his household. never before at any time was the king found so alone, and
 he was much distressed that he had no more numerous suite at his court. at
 that time a messenger comes running, whom they had sent ahead to apprise
 the king of their approach. this man came in before the assembly, found
 the king and all his people, and saluting him correctly, said: "i am a
 messenger of erec and of guivret the little." then he told him how they
 were coming to see him at his court. the king replies: "let them be
 welcome, as valiant and gallant gentlemen! nowhere do i know of any better
 than they two. by their presence my court will be much enhanced." then he
 sent for the queen and told her the news. the others have their horses
 saddled to go and meet the gentlemen. in such haste are they to mount that
 they did not put on their spurs. i ought to state briefly that the crowd
 of common people, including squires, cooks, and butlers, had already
 entered the town to prepare for the lodgings. the main party came after,
 and had already drawn so near that they had entered the town. now the two
 parties have met each other, and salute and kiss each other. they come to
 the lodgings and make themselves comfortable, removing their hose and
 making their toilet by donning their rich robes. when they were completely
 decked out, they took their way to the court. they come to court, where
 the king sees them, and the queen, who is beside herself with impatience
 to see erec and enide. the king makes them take seats beside him, kisses
 erec and guivret; about enide's neck he throws his arms and kisses her
 repeatedly, in his great joy. nor is the queen slow in embracing erec and
 enide. one might well rejoice to see her now so full of joy. every one
 enters with spirit into the merry-making. then the king causes silence to
 be made, and appeals to erec and asks news of his adventures. when the
 noise had ceased, erec began his story, telling him of his adventures,
 without forgetting any detail. do you think now that i shall tell you what
 motive he had had in starting out? nay, for you know the whole truth about
 this and the rest, as i have revealed it to you. to tell the story again
 would burden me; for the tale is not short, that any one should wish to
 begin it afresh and re-embelish it, as he told and related it: of the
 three knights whom he defeated, and then of the five, and then of the
 count who strove to do him harm, and then of the two giants—all in
 order, one after the other, he told him of his adventures up to the point
 where he met count oringle of limors. "many a danger have you gone
 through, fair gentle friend," said the king to him; "now tarry in this
 country at my court, as you are wont to do." "sire, since you wish it, i
 shall remain very gladly three or four years entire. but ask guivret to
 remain here too a request in which i would fain join." the king prays him
 to remain, and he consents to stay. so they both stay: the king kept them
 with him, and held them dear and honoured them.
 (vv. -.) erec stayed at court, together with guivret and enide,
 until the death of his father, the king, who was an old man and full of
 years. the messengers then started out: the nobles who went to seek him,
 and who were the greatest men of the land, sought and searched for him
 until they found him at tintagel three weeks before christmas; they told
 him the truth what had happened to his old, white-haired father, and how
 he now was dead and gone. this grieved erec much more than he showed
 before the people. but sorrow is not seemly in a king, nor does it become
 a king to mourn. there at tintagel where he was, he caused vigils for the
 dead and masses to be sung; he promised and kept his promises, as he had
 vowed to the religious houses and churches; he did well all that he ought
 to do: he chose out more than one hundred and sixty-nine of the wretched
 poor, and clothed them all in new garments. to the poor clerks and priors
 he gave, as was right, black copes and warm linings to wear beneath. for
 god's sake he did great good to all: to those who were in need he
 distributed more than a barrel of small coins. when he had shared his
 wealth, he then did a very wise thing in receiving his land from the
 king's hand; and then he begged the king to crown him at his court. the
 king bade him quickly be prepared; for they shall both be crowned, he
 together with his wife, at the approaching christmastide; and he added:
 "you must go hence to nantes in brittany; there you shall carry a royal
 ensign with crown on head and sceptre in hand; this gift and privilege i
 bestow upon you." erec thanked the king, and said that that was a noble
 gift. at christmas the king assembles all his nobles, summoning them
 individually and commanding them to come to nantes. he summoned them all,
 and none stayed behind. erec, too, sent word to many of his followers, and
 summoned them to come thither; but more came than he had bidden, to serve
 him and do him honour. i cannot tell you or relate who each one was, and
 what his name; but whoever came or did not come, the father and mother of
 my lady enide were not forgotten. her father was sent for first of all,
 and he came to court in handsome style, like a great lord and a chatelain.
 there was no great crowd of chaplains or of silly, gaping yokels, but of
 excellent knights and of people well equipped. each day they made a long
 day's journey, and rode on each day with great joy and great display,
 until on christmas eve they came to the city of nantes. they made no halt
 until they entered the great hall where the king and his courtiers were.
 erec and enide see them, and you may know how glad they were. to meet them
 they quickly make their way, and salute and embrace them, speaking to them
 tenderly and showing their delight as they should. when they had rejoiced
 together, taking each other by the hand, they all four came before the
 king, saluting him and likewise the queen, who was sitting by his side.
 taking his host by the hand, erec said: "sire, behold my good host, my
 kind friend, who did me such honour that he made me master in his own
 house. before he knew anything about me, he lodged me well and handsomely.
 all that he had he made over to me, and even his daughter he bestowed upon
 me, without the advice or counsel of any one." "and this lady with him,"
 the king inquires, "who is she?" erec does not conceal the truth: "sire,"
 says he, "of this lady i may say that she is the mother of my wife." "is
 she her mother?" "yes, truly, sire." "certainly, i may then well say that
 fair and comely should be the flower born of so fair a stem, and better
 the fruit one picks; for sweet is the smell of what springs from good.
 fair is enide and fair she should be in all reason and by right; for her
 mother is a very handsome lady, and her father is a goodly knight. nor
 does she in aught belie them; for she descends and inherits directly from
 them both in many respects." then the king ceases and sits down, bidding
 them be seated too. they do not disobey his command, but straightway take
 seats. now is enide filled with joy when she sees her father and mother,
 for a very long time had passed since she had seen them. her happiness now
 is greatly increased, for she was delighted and happy, and she showed it
 all she could, but she could not make such demonstration but that her joy
 was yet greater. but i wish to say no more of that, for my heart draws me
 toward the court which was now assembled in force. from many a different
 country there were counts and dukes and kings, normans, bretons. scotch,
 and irish: from england and cornwall there was a very rich gathering of
 nobles; for from wales to anjou, in maine and in poitou, there was no
 knight of importance, nor lady of quality, but the best and the most
 elegant were at the court at nantes, as the king had bidden them. now
 hear, if you will, the great joy and grandeur, the display and the wealth,
 that was exhibited at the court. before the hour of nones had sounded,
 king arthur dubbed four hundred knights or more all sons of counts and of
 kings. to each one he gave three horses and two pairs of suits, in order
 that his court may make a better showing. puissant and lavish was the
 king; for the mantles he bestowed were not of serge, nor of rabbit-skins,
 nor of cheap brown fur, but of heavy silk and ermine, of spotted fur and
 flowered silks, bordered with heavy and stiff gold braid. alexander, who
 conquered so much that he subdued the whole world, and who was so lavish
 and rich, compared with him was poor and mean. caesar, the emperor of
 rome, and all the kings whose names you hear in stories and in epic songs,
 did not distribute at any feast so much as arthur gave on the day that he
 crowned erec; nor would caesar and alexander dare to spend so much as he
 spent at the court. the raiment was taken from the chests and spread about
 freely through the halls; one could take what he would, without restraint.
 in the midst of the court, upon a rug, stood thirty bushels of bright
 sterlings;  for since the time of merlin
 until that day sterlings had currency throughout britain. there all helped
 themselves, each one carrying away that night all that he wanted to his
 lodging-place. at nine o'clock on christmas day, all came together again
 at court. the great joy that is drawing near for him had completely
 filched erec's heart away. the tongue and the mouth of no man, however
 skilful, could describe the third, or the fourth, or the fifth part of the
 display which marked his coronation. so it is a mad enterprise i undertake
 in wishing to attempt to describe it. but since i must make the effort,
 come what may, i shall not fail to relate a part of it, as best i may.
 (vv. -.) the king had two thrones of white ivory, well constructed
 and new, of one pattern and style. he who made them beyond a doubt was a
 very skilled and cunning craftsman. for so precisely did he make the two
 alike in height, in breadth, and in ornamentation, that you could nor look
 at them from every side to distinguish one from the other and find in one
 aught that was not in the other. there was no part of wood, but all of
 gold and fine ivory. well were they carved with great skill, for the two
 corresponding sides of each bore the representation of a leopard, and the
 other two a dragon's shape. a knight named bruiant of the isles had made a
 gift and present of them to king arthur and the queen. king arthur sat
 upon the one, and upon the other he made erec sit, who was robed in
 watered silk. as we read in the story, we find the description of the
 robe, and in order that no one may say that i lie, i quote as my authority
 macrobius,  who devoted himself to the
 description of it. macrobius instructs me how to describe, according as i
 have found it in the book, the workmanship and the figures of the cloth.
 four fairies had made it with great skill and mastery. 
 one represented there geometry, how it estimates and measures the extent
 of the heavens and the earth, so that nothing is lacking there; and then
 the depth and the height, and the width, and the length; then it
 estimates, besides, how broad and deep the sea is, and thus measures the
 whole world. such was the work of the first fairy. and the second devoted
 her effort to the portrayal of arithmetic, and she strove hard to
 represent clearly how it wisely enumerates the days and the hours of time,
 and the water of the sea drop by drop, and then all the sand, and the
 stars one by one, knowing well how to tell the truth, and how many leaves
 there are in the woods: such is the skill of arithmetic that numbers have
 never deceived her, nor will she ever be in error when she wishes to apply
 her sense to them. the third design was that of music, with which all
 merriment finds itself in accord, songs and harmonies, and sounds of
 string: of harp, of breton violin, and of viol. this piece of work was
 good and fine; for upon it were portrayed all the instruments and all the
 pastimes. the fourth, who next performed her task, executed a most
 excellent work; for the best of the arts she there portrayed. she
 undertook astronomy, which accomplishes so many marvels and draws
 inspiration from the stars, the moon, and the sun. nowhere else does it
 seek counsel concerning aught which it has to do. they give it good and
 sure advice. concerning whatever inquiry it make of them, whether in the
 past or in the future, they give it information without falsehood and
 without deception. this work was portrayed on the stuff of which erec's
 robe was made, all worked and woven with thread of gold. the fur lining
 that was sewed within, belonged to some strange beasts whose heads are all
 white, and whose necks are as black as mulberries, and which have red
 backs and green bellies, and dark blue tail. these beasts live in india
 and they are called "barbiolets". they eat nothing but spices, cinnamon,
 and fresh cloves. what shall i tell you of the mantle? it was very rich
 and fine and handsome; it had four stones in the tassels—two
 chrysolites on one side, and two amethysts on the other, which were
 mounted in gold.
 (vv. -.) as yet enide had not come to the palace. when the king
 sees that she delays, he bids gawain go quickly to bring her and the
 queen. gawain hastens and was not slow, and with him king cadoalant and
 the generous king of galloway. guivret the little accompanies them,
 followed by yder the son of nut. so many of the other nobles ran thither
 to escort the two ladies that they would have sufficed to overcome a host;
 for there were more than a thousand of them. the queen had made her best
 effort to adorn enide. into the palace they brought her the courteous
 gawain escorting her on one side, and on the other the generous king of
 galloway, who loved her dearly on account of erec who was his nephew. when
 they came to the palace, king arthur came quickly toward them, and
 courteously seated enide beside erec; for he wished to do her great
 honour. now he orders to be brought forth from his treasure two massive
 crowns of fine gold. as soon as he had spoken and given the command,
 without delay the crowns were brought before him, all sparkling with
 carbuncles, of which there were four in each. the light of the moon is
 nothing compared with the light which the least of the carbuncles could
 shed. because of the radiance which they shed, all those who were in the
 palace were so dazzled that for a moment they could see nothing; and even
 the king was amazed, and yet filled with satisfaction, when he saw them to
 be so clear and bright. he had one of them held by two damsels, and the
 other by two gentlemen. then he bade the bishops and priors and the abbots
 of the church step forward and anoint the new king, as the christian
 practice is. now all the prelates, young and old, came forward; for at the
 court there were a great number of bishops and abbots. the bishop of
 nantes himself, who was a very worthy and saintly man, anointed the new
 king in a very holy and becoming manner, and placed the crown upon his
 head. king arthur had a sceptre brought which was very fine. listen to the
 description of the sceptre, which was clearer than a pane of glass, all of
 one solid emerald, fully as large as your fist. i dare to tell you in very
 truth that in all the world there is no manner of fish, or of wild behest,
 or of man, or of flying bird that was not worked and chiselled upon it
 with its proper figure. the sceptre was handed to the king, who looked at
 it with amazement; then he put it without delay into king erec's right
 hand; and now he was king as he ought to be. then he crowned enide in
 turn. now the bells ring for mass, and they go to the main church to hear
 the mass and service; they go to pray at the cathedral. you would have
 seen weeping with joy the father of queen enide and her mother,
 carsenefide. in truth this was her mother's name, and her father's name
 was liconal. very happy were they both. when they came to the cathedral,
 the procession came out from the church with relics and treasures to meet
 them. crosses and prayerbooks and censers and reliquaries, with all the
 holy relics, of which there were many in the church, were all brought out
 to meet them; nor was there any lack of chants made. never were seen so
 many kings, counts, dukes, and nobles together at a mass, and the press
 was so great and thick that the church was completely filled. no low-born
 man could enter there, but only ladies and knights. outside the door of
 the church a great number still remained, so many were there come together
 who could not get inside the church. when they had heard all the mass they
 returned to the palace. it was all prepared and decorated: tables set and
 cloths spread five hundred tables and more were there; but i do not wish
 to make you believe a thing which does not seem true. it would seem too
 great a lie were i to say that five hundred tables were set in rows in one
 palace, so i will not say it; rather were there five hails so filled with
 them that with great difficulty could one make his way among the tables.
 at each table there was in truth a king or a duke or a count; and full a
 hundred knights were seated at each table. a thousand knights served the
 bread, and a thousand served the wine, and a thousand the meat—all
 of them dressed in fresh fur robes of ermine. all are served with divers
 dishes. even if i did not see them, i might still be able to tell you
 about them; but i must attend to something else than to tell you what they
 had to eat. they had enough, without wanting more; joyfully and liberally
 they were served to their heart's desire.
 (vv. -.) when this celebration was concluded, the king dismissed
 the assemblage of kings, dukes, and counts, of which the number was
 immense, and of the other humble folk who had come to the festival. he
 rewarded them liberally with horses, arms and silver, cloths and brocades
 of many kinds, because of his generosity, and because of erec whom he
 loved so much. here the story ends at last.

 we have fragments of poems on tristan by the anglo-norman poets beroul and
 thomas, who were contemporaries of chretien. foerster's hypothesis that
 the lost "tristan" of chretien antedated "erec" is doubtless correct. that
 the poet later treated of the love of cliges and fenice as a sort of
 literary atonement for the inevitable moral laxity of tristan and iseut

 thrown on the passage in our text by the english poem "the cokwold's

 implying so sudden a change in erec's attitude toward his wife, initiates
 a long series of tests of enide's devotion, which fill the rest of the
 romance. why did erec treat his wife with such severity? in the mabinogi
 of "geraint the son of erbin", it is plain that jealousy was the hero's
 motive. the reader of "erec" may judge whether, as we believe, the hero's
 sudden resolve is not rather that of a man piqued at being justly reproved
 by his wife for a delinquency he had not himself remarked; irate at his
 wife's imputation, and fearful of having forfeited her respect, he starts
 out to redeem his reputation in her eyes, and to maker her retract any
 insinuation she had made. erec is simply angry with himself, but he
 expends his wrath upon his defenceless wife until he is reassured of her
 love and respect for him.]

 common one. parallels will be found in the "voyage de charlemagne", in the

 child, in his "english and scotch ballads", indexes the ballads in his
 collection, which present this motive, under the following caption: "king

 is told that there is one who outstrips him, and undertakes to see for
 himself whether this is so, threatening death to the person who has
 affirmed his inferiority in case this is disproved."]

 which he regularly ascribes to him. readers of arthurian romance are all
 familiar with sir kay; they will find that in chretien, the seneschal, in
 addition to his undeniable qualities of bravery and frankness, has less
 pleasing traits; he is foolhardy, tactless, mean, and a disparager of
 others' merit. he figures prominently in "yvain" and "lancelot". his

 little farther on, of "la joie de la cour" is lame and unsatisfactory, as
 if he himself did not understand the significance of the matter upon which
 he was working. cf. e. philipot in "romania", xxv. -; k. othmer,

 commands of ovid and the art of love, and wrote the shoulder bite, 
 and about king mark and the fair iseut,  and about
 the metamorphosis of the lapwing,  the
 swallow, and the nightingale, will tell another story now about a youth
 who lived in greece and was a member of king arthur's line. but before i
 tell you aught of him, you shall hear of his father's life, whence he came
 and of what family. he was so bold and so ambitious that he left greece
 and went to england, which was called britain in those days, in order to
 win fame and renown. this story, which i intend to relate to you, we find
 written in one of the books of the library of my lord saint peter at
 beauvais. 
 from there the material was drawn of which chretien has made this romance.
 the book is very old in which the story is told, and this adds to its
 authority. 
 from such books which have been preserved we learn the deeds of men of old
 and of the times long since gone by. our books have informed us that the
 pre-eminence in chivalry and learning once belonged to greece. then
 chivalry passed to rome, together with that highest learning which now has
 come to france. god grant that it may be cherished here, and that it may
 be made so welcome here that the honour which has taken refuge with us may
 never depart from france: god had awarded it as another's share, but of
 greeks and romans no more is heard, their fame is passed, and their
 glowing ash is dead.
 (vv. -.) chretien begins his story as we find it in the history,
 which tells of an emperor powerful in wealth and honour who ruled over
 greece and constantinople. a very noble empress, too, there was, by whom
 the emperor had two children. but the elder son was already so far
 advanced before the younger one was born that, if he had wished, he might
 have become a knight and held all the empire beneath his sway. the name of
 the elder was alexander, and the other's name was alis. alexander, too,
 was the father's name, and the mother's name was tantalis. i shall now say
 nothing more of the emperor and of alis; but i shall speak of alexander,
 who was so bold and proud that he scorned to become a knight in his own
 country. he had heard of king arthur, who reigned in those days, and of
 the knights whom he always kept about him, thus causing his court to be
 feared and famed throughout the world. however, the affair may result and
 whatever fortune may await him, nothing can restrain alexander from his
 desire to go into britain, but he must obtain his father's consent before
 proceeding to britain and cornwall. so alexander, fair and brave, goes to
 speak with the emperor in order to ask and obtain his leave. now he will
 tell him of his desire and what he wishes to do and undertake. "fair
 sire," he says, "in quest of honour and fame and praise i dare to ask you
 a boon, which i desire you to give me now without delay, if you are
 willing to grant it to me." the emperor thinks no harm will come from this
 request: he ought rather to desire and long for his son's honour. "fair
 son," he says, "i grant you your desire; so tell me now what you wish me
 to give you." now the youth has accomplished his purpose, and is greatly
 pleased when the boon is granted him which he so greatly desired. "sire,"
 says he, "do you wish to know what it is that you have promised me? i wish
 to have a great plenty of gold and silver, and such companions from among
 your men as i will select; for i wish to go forth from your empire, and to
 present my service to the king who rules over britain, in order that he
 may make me a knight. i promise you never in my life to wear armour on my
 face or helmet upon my head until king arthur shall gird on my sword, if
 he will graciously do so. for from no other than from him will i accept my
 arms." without hesitation the emperor replies: "fair son, for god's sake,
 speak not so! this country all belongs to you, as well as rich
 constantinople. you ought not to think me mean, when i am ready to make
 you such a gift. i shall be ready soon to have you crowned, and to-morrow
 you shall be a knight. all greece will be in your hands, and you shall
 receive from your nobles, as is right, their homage and oaths of
 allegiance. whoever refuses such an offer is not wise."
 (vv. -.) the youth hears the promise how the next morning after mass
 his father is ready to dub him knight; but he says he will seek his
 fortune for better or worse in another land. "if you are willing in this
 matter to grant the boon i have asked of you, then give me mottled and
 grey furs, some good horses and silken stuffs: for before i become a
 knight i wish to enrol in king arthur's service. nor have i yet sufficient
 strength to bear arms. no one could induce me by prayer or flattery not to
 go to the foreign land to see his nobles and that king whose fame is so
 great for courtesy and prowess. many men of high degree lose through sloth
 the great renown which they might win, were they to wander about the
 world. 
 repose and glory ill agree, as it seems to me; for a man of wealth adds
 nothing to his reputation if he spends all his days at ease. prowess is
 irksome to the ignoble man, and cowardice is a burden to the man of
 spirit; thus the two are contrary and opposite. he is the slave of his
 wealth who spends his days in storing and increasing it. fair father, so
 long as i have the chance, and so long as my rigour lasts, i wish to
 devote my effort and energy to the pursuit of fame."
 (vv. -.) upon hearing this; the emperor doubtless feels both joy and
 grief: he is glad that his son's intention is fixed upon honour, and on
 the other hand he is sorrowful because his son is about to be separated
 from him. yet, because of the promise which he made, despite the grief he
 feels, he must grant his request; for an emperor must keep his word. "fair
 son," he says, "i must not fail to do your pleasure, when i see you thus
 striving for honour. from my treasure you may have two barges full of gold
 and silver; but take care to be generous and courteous and well-behaved."
 now the youth is very happy when his father promises him so much, and
 places his treasure at his disposal, and bids him urgently to give and
 spend generously. and his father explains his reason for this: "fair son,"
 he says, "believe me, that generosity is the dame and queen which sheds
 glory upon all the other virtues. and the proof of this is not far to
 seek. for where could you find a man, be he never so rich and powerful,
 who is not blamed if he is mean? nor could you find one, however
 ungracious he may be, whom generosity will not bring into fair repute?
 thus largess makes the gentleman, which result can be accomplished neither
 by high birth, courtesy, knowledge, gentility, money, strength, chivalry,
 boldness, dominion, beauty, or anything else.  but just
 as the rose is fairer than any other flower when it is fresh and newly
 blown, so there, where largess dwells, it takes its place above all other
 virtues, and increases five hundred fold the value of other good traits
 which it finds in the man who acquits himself well. so great is the merit
 of generosity that i could not tell you the half of it." the young man has
 now successfully concluded the negotiations for what he wished; for his
 father has acceded to all his desires. but the empress was sorely grieved
 when she heard of the journey which her son was about to take. yet,
 whoever may grieve or sorrow, and whoever may attribute his intention to
 youthful folly, and ever may blame and seek to dissuade him, the youth
 ordered his ships to be made ready as soon as possible, desiring to tarry
 no longer in his native land. at his command the ships were freighted that
 very night with wine, meat, and biscuit.
 (vv. -.) the ships were loaded in the port, and the next morning
 alexander came to the strand in high spirits, accompanied by his
 companions, who were happy over the prospective voyage. they were escorted
 by the emperor and the empress in her grief. at the port they find the
 sailors in the ships drawn up beside the cliff. the sea was calm and
 smooth, the wind was light, and the weather clear. when he had taken leave
 of his father, and bidden farewell to the empress, whose heart was heavy
 in her bosom, alexander first stepped from the small boat into the skip;
 then all his companions hastened by fours, threes, and twos to embark
 without delay. soon the sail was spread and the anchor raised. those on
 shore whose heart is heavy because of the men whom they watch depart,
 follow them with their gaze as long as they can: and in order to watch
 them longer, they all climb a high hill behind the beach. from there they
 sadly gaze, as long as their eyes can follow them. with sorrow, indeed,
 they watch them go, being solicitous for the youths, that god may bring
 them to their haven without accident and without peril. all of april and
 part of may they spent at sea. without any great danger or mishap they
 came to port at southampton.  one day, between three o'clock
 and vespers, they cast anchor and went ashore. the young men, who had
 never been accustomed to endure discomfort or pain, had suffered so long
 from their life at sea that they had all lost their colour, and even the
 strongest and most vigorous were weak and faint. in spite of that, they
 rejoice to have escaped from the sea and to have arrived where they wished
 to be. because of their depleted state, they spend the night at
 southampton in happy frame, and make inquiries whether the king is in
 england. they are told that he is at winchester, and that they can reach
 there in a very short time if they will start early in the morning and
 keep to the straight road. at this news they are greatly pleased, and the
 next morning at daybreak the youths wake early, and prepare and equip
 themselves. and when they were ready, they left southampton, and kept to
 the direct road until they reached winchester, where the king was. before
 six o'clock in the morning the greeks had arrived at the court. the
 squires with the horses remain below in the yard, while the youths go up
 into the presence of the king, who was the best that ever was or ever will
 be in the world. and when the king sees them coming, they please him
 greatly, and meet with his favour. but before approaching the king's
 presence, they remove the cloaks from about their necks, lest they should
 be considered ill-bred. thus, all unmantled, they came before the king,
 while all the nobles present held their peace, greatly pleased at the
 sight of these handsome and well-behaved young men. they suppose that of
 course they are all sons of counts or kings; and, to be sure, so they
 were, and of a very charming age, with graceful and shapely forms. and the
 clothes they wore were all of the same stuff and cut of the same
 appearance and colour. there were twelve of them beside their lord, of
 whom i need tell you no more than that there was none better than he. with
 modesty and orderly mien, he was handsome and shapely as he stood
 uncovered before the king. then he kneeled before him, and all the others,
 for honour's sake, did the same beside their lord.
 (vv. -.) alexander, with his tongue well skilled in speaking fair
 and wisely, salutes the king. "king," he says, "unless the report is false
 that spreads abroad your fame, since god created the first man there was
 never born a god-fearing man of such puissance as yours. king, your
 widespread renown has drawn me to serve and honour you in your court, and
 if you will accept my service, i would fain remain here until i be dubbed
 a knight by your hand and by no one else. for unless i receive this honour
 from your hand, i shall renounce all intention of being knighted. if you
 will accept my service until you are willing to dub me a knight, retain me
 now, oh gentle king, and my companions gathered here." to which at once
 the king replies: "friend, i refuse neither you nor your companions. be
 welcome all. for surely you seem, and i doubt it not, to be sons of
 high-born men. whence do you come?" "from greece." "from greece?" "yes."
 "who is thy father?" "upon my word, sire, the emperor." "and what is thy
 name, fair friend?" "alexander is the name that was given me when i
 received the salt and holy oil, and christianity and baptism." "alexander,
 my dear, fair friend. i will keep you with me very gladly, with great
 pleasure and delight. for you have done me signal honour in thus coming to
 my court. i wish you to be honoured here, as free vassals who are wise and
 gentle. you have been too long upon your knees; now, at my command, and
 henceforth make your home with man and in my court; it is well that you
 have come to us."
 (vv. -.) then the greeks rise up, joyful that the king has so kindly
 invited them to stay. alexander did well to come; for he lacks nothing
 that he desires, and there is no noble at the court who does not address
 him kindly and welcome him. he is not so foolish as to be puffed up, nor
 does he vaunt himself nor boast. he makes acquaintance with my lord gawain
 and with the others, one by one. he gains the good graces of them all, but
 my lord gawain grows so fond of him that he chooses him as his friend and
 companion.  the greeks took the best
 lodgings to be had, with a citizen of the town. alexander had brought
 great possessions with him from constantinople, intending to give heed
 above all to the advice and counsel of the emperor, that his heart should
 be ever ready to give and dispense his riches well. to this end he devotes
 his efforts, living well in his lodgings, and giving and spending
 liberally, as is fitting in one so rich, and as his heart dictates. the
 entire court wonders where he got all the wealth that he bestows; for on
 all sides he presents the valuable horses which he had brought from his
 own land. so much did alexander do, in the performance of his service,
 that the king, the queen, and the nobles bear him great affection. king
 arthur about this time desired to cross over into brittany. so he summons
 all his barons together to take counsel and inquire to whom he may entrust
 england to be kept in peace and safety until his return. by common
 consent, it seems, the trust was assigned to count angres of windsor, for
 it was their judgement that there was no more trustworthy lord in all the
 king's realm. when this man had received the land, king arthur set out the
 next day accompanied by the queen and her damsels. the bretons make great
 rejoicing upon hearing the news in brittany that the king and his barons
 are on the way.
 (vv. -.) into the ship in which the king sailed there entered no
 youth or maiden save only alexander and soredamors, whom the queen brought
 with her. this maiden was scornful of love, for she had never heard of any
 man whom she would deign to love, whatever might be his beauty, prowess,
 lordship, or birth. and yet the damsel was so charming and fair that she
 might fitly have learned of love, if it had pleased her to lend a willing
 ear; but she would never give a thought to love. now love will make her
 grieve, and will avenge himself for all the pride and scorn with which she
 has always treated him. carefully love has aimed his dart with which he
 pierced her to the heart. now she grows pale and trembles, and in spite of
 herself must succumb to love. only with great difficulty can she restrain
 herself from casting a glance toward alexander; but she must be on her
 guard against her brother, my lord gawain. dearly she pays and atones for
 her great pride and disdain. love has heated for her a bath which heats
 and burns her painfully. at first it is grateful to her, and then it
 hurts; one moment she likes it, and the next she will have none of it. she
 accuses her eyes of treason, and says:  "my
 eyes, you have betrayed me now! my heart, usually so faithful, now bears
 me ill-will because of you. now what i see distresses me. distresses? nay,
 verily, rather do i like it well. and if i actually see something that
 distresses me, can i not control my eyes? my strength must indeed have
 failed, and little should i esteem myself, if i cannot control my eyes and
 make them turn their glance elsewhere. thus, i shall be able to baffle
 love in his efforts to get control of me. the heart feels no pain when the
 eye does not see; so, if i do not look at him, no harm will come to me. he
 addresses me no request or prayer, as he would do were he in love with me.
 and since he neither loves nor esteems me, shall i love him without
 return? if his beauty allures my eyes, and my eyes listen to the call,
 shall i say that i love him just for that? nay, for that would be a lie.
 therefore, he has no ground for complaint, nor can i make any claim
 against him. one cannot love with the eyes alone. what crime, then, have
 my eyes committed, if their glance but follows my desire? what is their
 fault and what their sin? ought i to blame them, then? nay, verily. who,
 then, should be blamed? surely myself, who have them in control. my eye
 glances at nothing unless it gives my heart delight. my heart ought not to
 have any desire which would give me pain. yet its desire causes me pain.
 pain? upon my faith, i must be mad, if to please my heart i wish for
 something which troubles me. if i can, i ought to banish any wish that
 distresses me. if i can? mad one, what have i said? i must, indeed, have
 little power if i have no control over myself. does love think to set me
 in the same path which is wont to lead others astray? others he may lead
 astray, but not me who care not for him. never shall i be his, nor ever
 was, and i shall never seek his friendship." thus she argues with herself,
 one moment loving, and hating the next. she is in such doubt that she does
 not know which course she had better adopt. she thinks to be on the
 defence against love, but defence is not what she wants. god! she does not
 know that alexander is thinking of her too! love bestows upon them equally
 such a share as is their due. he treats them very fairly and justly, for
 each one loves and desires the other. and this love would be true and
 right if only each one knew what was the other's wish. but he does not
 know what her desire is, and she knows not the cause of his distress.
 (vv. -.) the queen takes note of them and sees them often blanch and
 pale and heave deep sighs and tremble. but she knows no reason why they
 should do so, unless it be because of the sea where they are. i think she
 would have divined the cause had the sea not thrown her off her guard, but
 the sea deceives and tricks her, so that she does not discover love
 because of the sea; and it is from love that comes the bitter pain that
 distresses them.  but of the three concerned,
 the queen puts all the blame upon the sea; for the other two accuse the
 third to her, and hold it alone responsible for their guilt. some one who
 is not at fault is often blamed for another's wrong. thus, the queen lays
 all the blame and guilt upon the sea, but it is unfair to put the blame
 upon the sea, for it is guilty of no misdeed. soredamors' deep distress
 continued until the vessel came to port. as for the king, it is well known
 that the bretons were greatly pleased, and served him gladly as their
 liege lord. but of king arthur i will not longer speak in this place;
 rather shall you hear me tell how love distresses these two lovers whom he
 has attacked.
 (vv. -.) alexander loves and desires her; and she, too, pines for
 the love of him, but he knows it not, nor will he know it until he has
 suffered many a pain and many a grief. it is for her sake that he renders
 to the queen loving service, as well as to her maids-in-waiting; but to
 her on whom his thoughts are fixed, he dares not speak or address a word.
 if she but dared to assert to him the right which she thinks she has, she
 would gladly inform him of the truth; but she does not dare, and cannot do
 it. they dare neither speak nor act in accordance with what each sees in
 the other—which works a great hardship to them both, and their love
 but grows and flames the more. however, it is the custom of all lovers to
 feast their eyes gladly with gazing, if they can do no more; and they
 assume that, because they find pleasure in that which causes their love to
 be born and grow, therefore it must be to their advantage; whereas it only
 harms them more, just as he who approaches and draws close beside the fire
 burns himself more than he who holds aloof. their love waxes and grows
 anon; but each is abashed before the other, and so much is hidden and
 concealed that no flame or smoke arises from the coals beneath the ashes.
 the heat is no less on this account, but rather is better sustained
 beneath the ashes than above. both of them are in great torment; for, in
 order that none may perceive their trouble, they are forced to deceive
 people by a feigned bearing; but at night comes the bitter moan, which
 each one makes within his breast. of alexander i will tell you first how
 he complains and vents his grief. love presents before his mind her for
 whom he is in such distress; it is she who has filched his heart away, and
 grants him no rest upon his bed, because, forsooth, he delights to recall
 the beauty and the grace of her who, he has no hope, will ever bring him
 any joy. "i may as well hold myself a madman." he exclaims. "a madman?
 truly, i am beside myself, when i dare not speak what i have in mind; for
 it would speedily fare worse with me (if i held my peace). i have engaged
 my thoughts in a mad emprise. but is it not better to keep my thoughts to
 myself than to be called a fool? my wish will never then be known. shall i
 then conceal the cause of my distress, and not dare to seek aid and
 healing for my wound? he is mad who feels himself afflicted, and seeks not
 what will bring him health, if perchance he may find it anywhere; but many
 a one seeks his welfare by striving for his heart's desire, who pursues
 only that which brings him woe instead. and why should one ask for advice,
 who does not expect to gain his health? he would only exert himself in
 vain. i feel my own illness to be so grievous that i shall never be healed
 by any medicine or draught, by any herb or root. for some ills there is no
 remedy, and mine lies so deep within that it is beyond the reach of
 medicine. is there no help, then? methinks i have lied. when first i felt
 this malady, if i had dared to make mention of it. i might have spoken
 with a physician who could have completely cured me. but i like not to
 discuss such matters; i think he would pay me no heed and would not
 consent to accept a fee. no wonder, then, if i am terrified; for i am very
 ill, yet i do not know what disease this is which has me in its grip, and
 i know not whence this pain has come. i do not know? i know full well that
 it is love who does me this injury. how is that? can love do harm? is he
 not gentle and well-bred? i used to think that there was naught but good
 in love; but i have found him full of enmity. he who has not had
 experience of him does not know what tricks love plays. he is a fool who
 joins his ranks; for he always seeks to harm his followers. upon my faith,
 his tricks are bad. it is poor sport to play with him, for his game will
 only do me harm. what shall i do, then? shall i retreat? i think it would
 be wise to do so, but i know not how to do it. if love chastens and
 threatens me in order to teach and instruct me, ought i to disdain my
 teacher? he is a fool who scorns his master. i ought to keep and cherish
 the lesson which love teaches me, for great good may soon come of it. but
 i am frightened because he beats me so. and dost thou complain, when no
 sign of blow or wound appears? art thou not mistaken? nay, for he has
 wounded me so deep that he has shot his dart to my very heart, and has not
 yet drawn it out again.  how has he pierced thy body
 with it, when no wound appears without? tell me that, for i wish to know.
 how did he make it enter in? through the eye. through the eye? but he has
 not put it out? he did not harm the eye at all, but all the pain is in the
 heart. then tell me, if the dart passed through the eye, how is it that
 the eye itself is not injured or put out. if the dart entered through the
 eye, why does the heart in the breast complain, when the eye, which
 received the first effect, makes no complaint of it at all? i can readily
 account for that: the eye is not concerned with the understanding, nor has
 it any part in it; but it is the mirror of the heart, and through this
 mirror passes, without doing harm or injury, the flame which sets the
 heart on fire. for is not the heart placed in the breast just like a
 lighted candle which is set in a lantern? if you take the candle away no
 light will shine from the lantern; but so long as the candle lasts the
 lantern is not dark at all, and the flame which shines within does it no
 harm or injury. likewise with a pane of glass, which might be very strong
 and solid, and yet a ray of the sun could pass through it without cracking
 it at all; yet a piece of glass will never be so bright as to enable one
 to see, unless a stronger light strikes its surface. know that the same
 thing is true of the eyes as of the glass and the lantern; for the light
 strikes the eyes in which the heart is accustomed to see itself reflected,
 and lo! it sees some light outside, and many other things, some green,
 some purple, others red or blue; and some it dislikes, and some it likes,
 scorning some and prizing others. but many an object seems fair to it when
 it looks at it in the glass, which will deceive it if it is not on its
 guard. my mirror has greatly deceived me; for in it my heart saw a ray of
 light with which i am afflicted, and which has penetrated deep within me,
 causing me to lose my wits. i am ill-treated by my friend, who deserts me
 for my enemy. i may well accuse him of felony for the wrong he has done to
 me. i thought i had three friends, my heart and my two eyes together; but
 it seems that they hate me. where shall i ever find a friend, when these
 three are my enemies, belonging to me, yet putting me to death? my
 servants mock at my authority, in doing what they please without
 consulting my desire. after my experience with these who have done me
 wrong, i know full well that a good man's love may be befouled by wicked
 servants in his employ. he who is attended by a wicked servant will surely
 have cause to rue it, sooner or later. now i will tell you how the arrow,
 which has come into my keeping and possession, is made and fashioned; but
 i fear greatly that i shall fail in the attempt; for the fashion of it is
 so fine that it will be no wonder if i fail. yet i shall devote all my
 effort to telling you how it seems to me. the notch and the feathers are
 so close together, when carefully examined, that the line of separation is
 as fine as a hair's breadth; but the notch is so smooth and straight that
 in it surely no improvement could be made. the feathers are coloured as if
 they were of gold or gilt; but gilt is here beside the mark, for i know
 these feathers were more brilliant than any gilt. this dart is barbed with
 the golden tresses that i saw the other day at sea. that is the dart which
 awakes my love. god! what a treasure to possess! would he who could gain
 such a prize crave other riches his whole life long? for my part i could
 swear that i should desire nothing else; i would not give up even the barb
 and the notch for all the gold of antioch. and if i prize so highly these
 two things, who could estimate the value of what remains? that is so fair
 and full of charm, so dear and precious, that i yearn and long to gaze
 again upon her brow, which god's hand has made so clear that it were vain
 to compare with it any mirror, emerald, or topaz. but all this is of
 little worth to him who sees her flashing eyes; to all who gaze on them
 they seem like twin candles burning. and whose tongue is so expert as to
 describe the fashion of her well-shaped nose and radiant face, in which
 the rose suffuses the lily so as to efface it somewhat, and thus enhance
 the glory of her visage? and who shall speak of her laughing mouth, which
 god shaped with such great skill that none might see it and not suppose
 that she was laughing? and what about her teeth? they are so close to one
 another that it seems they are all of one solid piece, and in order that
 the effect might still be enhanced nature added her handiwork; for any
 one, to see her part her lips, would suppose that the teeth were of ivory
 or of silver. there is so much to be said were i to portray each detailed
 charm of chin and ears, that it would not be strange were i to pass over
 some little thing. of her throat i shall only say that crystal beside it
 looks opaque. and her neck beneath her hair is four times as white as
 ivory. between the border of her gown and the buckle at the parted throat,
 i saw her bosom left exposed and whiter than new-fallen snow. my pain
 would be indeed assuaged, if i had seen the dart entire. gladly would i
 tell, if i but knew, what was the nature of the shaft. but i did nor see
 it, and it is not my fault if i do not attempt to describe something i
 have never seen. at that time love showed me only the notch and the barb;
 for the shaft was hidden in the quiver, to wit, in the robe and shift in
 which the damsel was arrayed. upon my faith, malady which tortures me is
 the arrow—it is the dart at which i am a wretch to be enraged. i am
 ungrateful to be incensed. never shall a straw be broken because of any
 distrust or quarrel that may arise between love and me. now let love do
 what he will with me as with one who belongs to him; for i wish it, and so
 it pleases me. i hope that this malady may never leave me, but that it may
 thus always maintain its hold, and that health may never come to me except
 from the source of my illness."
 (vv. -.) alexander's complaint is long enough; but that of the
 maiden is nothing less. all night she lies in such distress that she
 cannot sleep or get repose. love has confined within her heart a struggle
 and conflict which disturbs her breast, and which causes her such pain and
 anguish that she weeps and moans all night, and tosses about with sudden
 starts, so that she is almost beside herself. and when she has tossed and
 sobbed and groaned and started up and sighed again then she looked within
 her heart to see who and what manner of man it was for whom love was
 tormenting her. and when she has refreshed herself somewhat with thinking
 to her heart's content, she stretches and tosses about again, and
 ridicules all the thoughts she has had. then she takes another course, and
 says: "silly one, what matters it to me if this youth is of good birth and
 wise and courteous and valorous? all this is simply to his honour and
 credit. and as for his beauty, what care i? let his beauty be gone with
 him! but if so, it will be against my will, for it is not my wish to
 deprive him of anything. deprive? no, indeed! that i surely will not do.
 if he had the wisdom of solomon, and if nature had bestowed on him all the
 beauty she can place in human form, and if god had put in my power to undo
 it all, yet would i not injure him; but i would gladly, if i could, make
 him still more wise and fair. in faith, then, i do not hate him! and am i
 for that reason his friend? nay, i am not his any more than any other
 man's. then what do i think of him so much, if he pleases me no more than
 other men? i do not know; i am all confused; for i never thought so much
 about any man in the world, and if i had my will, i should see him all the
 time, and never take my eyes from him. i feel such joy at the sight of
 him! is this love? yes, i believe it is. i should not appeal to him so
 often, if i did not love him above all others. so i love him, then, let it
 be agreed. then shall i not do what i please? yes, provided he does not
 refuse. this intention of mine is wrong; but love has so filled my heart
 that i am mad and beside myself, nor will any defence avail me now, if i
 must endure the assault of love. i have demeaned myself prudently toward
 love so long, and would never accede to his will; but now i am more than
 kindly disposed toward him. and what thanks will he owe to me, if he
 cannot have my loving service and good-will? by force he has humbled my
 pride, and now i must follow his pleasure. now i am ready to love, and i
 have a master, and love will teach me—but what? how i am to serve
 his will. but of that i am very well informed, and am so expert in serving
 him that no one could find fault with me. i need learn no more of that.
 love would have it, and so would i, that i should be sensible and modest
 and kind and approachable to all for the sake of one i love. shall i love
 all men, then, for the sake of one? i should be pleasant to every one, but
 love does not bid me be the true friend of every one. love's lessons are
 only good. it is not without significance that i am called by the name of
 soredamors.  i am destined to love and be
 loved in turn, and i intend to prove it by my name, if i can find the
 explanation there. there is some significance in the fact that the first
 part of my name is of golden colour; for what is golden is the best. for
 this reason i highly esteem my name, because it begins with that colour
 with which the purest gold harmonises. and the end of the name calls love
 to my mind; for whoever calls me by my right name always refreshes me with
 love. and one half gilds the other with a bright coat of yellow gold; for
 soredamors has the meaning of 'one gilded over with love.' love has highly
 honoured me in gilding me over with himself. a gilding of real gold is not
 so fine as that which makes me radiant. and i shall henceforth do my best
 to be his gilding, and shall never again complain of it. now i love and
 ever more shall love. whom? truly, that is a fine question! him whom love
 bids me love, for no other shall ever have my love. what will he care in
 his ignorance, unless i tell him of it myself? what shall i do, if i do
 not make to him my prayer? whoever desires anything ought to ask for it
 and make request. what? shall i beseech him, then? nay. why? did ever such
 a thing come about that a woman should be so forward as to make love to
 any man; unless she were clean beside herself. i should be mad beyond
 question if i uttered anything for which i might be reproached. if he
 should know the truth through word of mine i think he would hold me in
 slight esteem, and would often reproach me with having solicited his love.
 may love never be so base that i should be the first to prefer a request
 which would lower me in his eyes! alas, god! how will he ever know the
 truth, since i shall not tell him of it? as yet i have very little cause
 to complain. i will wait until his attention is aroused, if ever it is to
 be aroused. he will surely guess the truth, i think, if ever he has had
 commerce with love, or has heard of it by word of mouth. heard of it? that
 is a foolish thing to say. love is not of such easy access that any one
 may claim acquaintance by hear-say only and without personal experience. i
 have come to know that well enough myself; for i could never learn
 anything of love through flattery and wooing words, though i have often
 been in the school of experience, and have been flattered many a time. but
 i have always stood aloof, and now he makes me pay a heavy penalty: now i
 know more about it than does the ox of ploughing. but one thing causes me
 despair: i fear he has never been in love. and if he is not in love, and
 never has been so, then i have sowed in the sea where no seed can take
 root. so there is nothing to do but wait and suffer, until i see whether i
 can lead him on by hints and covered words. i shall continue this until he
 is sure of my love and dares to ask me for it. so there is nothing more
 about the matter, but that i love him and am his. if he loves me not, yet
 will i love him."
 (vv. -.) thus he and she utter their complaint, unhappy at night
 and worse by day, each hiding the truth from the other's eyes. in such
 distress they remained a long time in brittany, i believe, until the end
 of the summer came. at the beginning of october there came messengers by
 dover from london and canterbury, bearing to the king news which troubled
 him. the messengers told him that he might be tarrying too long in
 brittany; for, he to whom he had entrusted the kingdom was intending to
 withstand him, and had already summoned a great army of his vassals and
 friends, and had established himself in london for the purpose of
 defending the city against arthur when he should return.
 (vv. -.) when the king heard this news, angry and sore displeased
 he summons all his knights. in order the better to spur them on to punish
 the traitor, he tells them that they are entirely to blame for his trouble
 and strife; for on their advice he entrusted his land to the hands of the
 traitor, who is worse than ganelon.  there
 is not a single one who does not agree that the king is right, for he had
 only followed their advice; but now this man is to be outlawed, and you
 may be sure that no town or city will avail to save his body from being
 dragged out by force. thus they all assure the king, giving him their word
 upon oath, that they will deliver the traitor to him, or never again claim
 their fiefs. and the king proclaims throughout brittany that no one who
 can bear arms shall refuse to follow him at once.
 (vv. -.) all brittany is now astir. never was such an army seen as
 king arthur brought together. when the ships came to set sail, it seemed
 that the whole world was putting out to sea; for even the water was hid
 from view, being covered with the multitude of ships. it is certainly true
 that, to judge by the commotion, all brittany is under way. now the ships
 have crossed the channel, and the assembled host is quartered on the
 shore. alexander bethought himself to go and pray the king to make him a
 knight, for if ever he should win renown it will be in this war. prompted
 by his desire, he takes his companions with him to accomplish what he has
 in mind. on reaching the king's quarters, they found him seated before his
 tent. when he saw the greeks approaching, he summoned them to him, saying:
 "gentlemen, do not conceal what business has brought you here." alexander
 replied on behalf of all, and told him his desire: "i have come," he says,
 "to request of you, as i ought to do of my liege lord, on behalf of my
 companions and myself, that you should make us knights." the king replies:
 "very gladly; nor shall there be any delay about it, since you have
 preferred your request." then the king commands that equipment shall be
 furnished for twelve knights. straightway the king's command is done. as
 each one asks for his equipment, it is handed to him—rich arms and a
 good horse: thus each one received his outfit. the arms and robes and
 horse were of equal value for each of the twelve; but the harness for
 alexander s body, if it should be valued or sold, was alone worth as much
 as that of all the other twelve. at the water's edge they stripped, and
 then washed and bathed themselves. not wishing that any other bath should
 be heated for them, they washed in the sea and used it as their tub. 
 (vv. -.) all this is known to the queen, who bears alexander no
 ill will, but rather loves, esteems, and values him. she wishes to make
 alexander a gift, but it is far more precious than she thinks. she seeks
 and delves in all her boxes until she finds a white silk shirt, well made
 of delicate texture, and very soft. every thread in the stitching of it
 was of gold, or of silver at least. soredamors had taken a hand in the
 stitching of it here and there, and at intervals, in the sleeves and neck,
 she had inserted beside the gold a strand of her own hair, to see if any
 man could be found who, by close examination, could detect the difference.
 for the hair was quite as bright and golden as the thread of gold itself.
 the queen takes the shirt and presents it to alexander. ah, god! what joy
 would alexander have felt had he known what the queen was giving him! and
 how glad would she, too, have been, who had inserted her own hair, if she
 had known that her lover was to own and wear it! she could then have taken
 great comfort; for she would not have cared so much for all the hair she
 still possessed as for the little that alexander had. but, more is the
 pity, neither of them knew the truth. the queen's messenger finds the
 youths on the shore where they are bathing, and gives the shirt to
 alexander. he is greatly pleased with it, esteeming the present all the
 more because it was given him by the queen. but if he had known the rest,
 he would have valued it still more; in exchange for it he would not have
 taken the whole world, but rather would have made a shrine of it and
 worshipped it, doubtless, day and night.
 (vv. -.) alexander delays no longer, but dresses himself at once.
 when he was dressed and ready, he returned to the king's tent with all his
 companions. the queen, it seems, had come there, too, wishing to see the
 new knights present themselves. they might all be called handsome, but
 alexander with his shapely body was the fairest of them all. well, now
 that they are knights i will say no more of them for the present, but will
 tell of the king and of his host which came to london. most of the people
 remained faithful to him, though many allied themselves with the
 opposition. count angres assembled his forces, consisting of all those
 whose influence could be gained by promises or gifts. when he had gathered
 all his strength, he slipped away quietly at night, fearing to be betrayed
 by the many who hated him. but before he made off, he sacked london as
 completely as possible of provisions, gold and silver, which he divided
 among his followers. this news was told to the king, how the traitor had
 escaped with all his forces, and that he had carried off from the city so
 many supplies that the distressed citizens were impoverished and
 destitute. then the king replied that he would not take a ransom for the
 traitor, but rather hang him, if he could catch him or lay hands on him.
 thereupon, all the army proceeded to windsor. however it may be now, in
 those days the castle was not easy to take when any one chose to defend
 it. the traitor made it secure, as soon as he planned his treacherous
 deed, with a triple line of walls and moats, and had so braced the walls
 inside with sharpened stakes that catapults could not throw them down.
 they had taken great pains with the fortifications, spending all of june,
 july, and august in building walls and barricades, making moats and
 drawbridges, ditches, obstructions, and barriers, and iron portcullises
 and a great square tower of stone. the gate was never closed from fear or
 against assault. the castle stood upon a high hill, and around beneath it
 flows the thames. the host encamped on the river bank, and that day they
 have time only to pitch camp and set up the tents.
 (vv. -.) the army is in camp beside the thames, and all the meadow
 is filled with green and red tents. the sun, striking on the colours,
 causes the river to flash for more than a league around. those in the town
 had come down to disport themselves upon the river bank with only their
 lances in their hands and their shields grasped before their breasts, and
 carrying no other arms at all. in coming thus, they showed those without
 the walls that they stood in no fear of them. alexander stood aloof and
 watched the knights disporting themselves at feats of arms. he yearns to
 attack them, and summons his companions one by one by name. first cornix,
 whom he dearly loved, then the doughty licorides, then nabunal of mvcene,
 and acorionde of athens, and ferolin of salonica, and calcedor from
 africa, parmenides and francagel, mighty torin and pinabel, nerius and
 neriolis. "my lords," he says, "i feel the call to go with shield and
 lance to make the acquaintance of those who disport themselves yonder
 before our eyes. i see they scorn us and hold us in slight esteem, when
 they come thus without their arms to exercise before our very eyes. we
 have just been knighted, and have not yet given an account of ourselves
 against any knight or manikin.  we have
 kept our first lances too long intact. and for what were our shields
 intended? as yet, they have not a hole or crack to show. there is no use
 in having them except in a combat or a fight. let's cross the ford and
 rush at them!" "we shall not fail you," all reply; and each one adds: "so
 help me god, who fails you now is no friend of yours." then they fasten on
 their swords, tighten their saddles and girths, and mount their steeds
 with shields in hand. when they had hung the shields about their necks,
 and taken their lances with the gaily coloured ensigns, they all proceed
 to the ford at once. those on the farther side lower their lances, and
 quickly ride to strike at them. but they (on the hither bank) knew how to
 pay them back, not sparing nor avoiding them, nor yielding to them a foot
 of ground. rather, each man struck his opponent so fiercely that there is
 no knight so brave but is compelled to leave the saddle. they did not
 underestimate the experience, skill, and bravery of their antagonists, but
 made their first blows count, and unhorsed thirteen of them. the report
 spread to the camp of the fight and of the blows that were being struck.
 there would soon have been a merry strife if the others had dared to stand
 their ground. all through the camp they run to arms, and raising a shout
 they cross the ford. and those on the farther bank take to flight, seeing
 no advantage in staying where they are. and the greeks pursue them with
 blows of lance and sword. though they struck off many a head they
 themselves did not receive a wound, and gave a good account of themselves
 that day. but alexander distinguished himself, who by his own efforts led
 off four captive knights in bonds. the sands are strewn with headless
 dead, while many others lie wounded and injured.
 (vv. -.) alexander courteously presents the victims of his first
 conquest to the queen, not wishing them to fall into the hands of the
 king, who would have had them all hanged. the queen, however, had them
 seized and safely kept under guard, as being charged with treason.
 throughout the camp they talk of the greeks, and all maintain that
 alexander acted very courteously and wisely in not surrendering the
 knights whom he had captured to the king, who would surely have had them
 burned or hanged. but the king is not so well satisfied, and sending
 promptly to the queen he bids her come into his presence and not detain
 those who have proved treacherous towards him, for either she must give
 them up or offend him by keeping them. while the queen was in conference
 with the king, as was necessary, about the traitors, the greeks remained
 in the queen's tent with her maids-in-waiting. while his twelve companions
 conversed with them, alexander uttered not a word. soredamors took note of
 this, seated as she was close by his side. her head resting upon her hand,
 it was plain that she was lost in thought.  thus
 they sat a long time, until soredamors saw on his sleeve and about his
 neck the hair which she had stitched into the shirt. then she drew a
 little closer thinking now to find an excuse for speaking a word to him.
 she considers how she can address him first, and what the first word is to
 be—whether she should address him by his name; and thus she takes
 counsel with herself: "what shall i say first?" she says; "shall i address
 him by his name, or shall i call him 'friend'? friend? not i. how then?
 shall i call him by his name? god! the name of 'friend' is fair and sweet
 to take upon the lips. if i should dare to call him 'friend'! should i
 dare? what forbids me to do so? the fact that that implies a lie. a lie? i
 know not what the result will be, but i shall be sorry if i do not speak
 the truth. therefore, it is best to admit that i should not like to speak
 a lie. god! yet he would not speak a lie were he to call me his sweet
 friend! and should i lie in thus addressing him? we ought both to tell the
 truth. but if i lie the fault is his. but why does his name seem so hard
 to me that i should wish to replace it by a surname? i think it is because
 it is so long that i should stop in the middle. but if i simply called him
 'friend', i could soon utter so short a name. fearing lest i should break
 down in uttering his proper name, i would fain shed my blood if his name
 were simply 'my sweet friend.'"
 (vv. -.) she turns this thought over in her mind until the queen
 returns from the king who had summoned her. alexander, seeing her come,
 goes to meet her, and inquires what is the king's command concerning the
 prisoners, and what is to be their fate. "friend," says she, "he requires
 of me to surrender them at his discretion, and to let his justice be
 carried out. indeed, he is much incensed that i have not already handed
 them over. so i must needs send them to him, since i see no help for it."
 thus they passed that day; and the next day there was a great assembly of
 all the good and loyal knights before the royal tent to sit in judgment
 and decide by what punishment and torture the four traitors should die.
 some hold that they should be flayed alive, and others that they should be
 hanged or burned. and the king, for his part, maintains that traitors
 ought to be torn asunder. then he commands them to be brought in. when
 they are brought, he orders them to be bound, and says that they shall not
 be torn asunder until they are taken beneath the town, so that those
 within may see the sight. 
 (vv. -.) when this sentence was pronounced, the king addresses
 alexander, calling him his dear friend. "my friend," he says, "yesterday i
 saw you attack and defend yourself with great bravery. i wish now to
 reward your action! i will add to your company five hundred welsh knights
 and one thousand troopers from that land. in addition to what i have given
 you, when the war is over i will crown you king of the best kingdom in
 wales. towns and castles, cities and halls will i give you until the time
 you receive the land which your father holds, and of which you are to be
 emperor." alexander's companions join him in thanking the king kindly for
 this boon, and all the nobles of the court say that the honour which the
 king has bestowed upon alexander is well deserved.
 (vv. -.) as soon as alexander sees his force, consisting of the
 companions and the men-at-arms whom it had pleased the king to give him,
 straightway they begin to sound the horns and trumpets throughout the
 camp. men of wales and britain, of scotland and cornwall, both good and
 bad without exception—all take arms, for the forces of the host were
 recruited from all quarters. the thames was low because of the drought
 resulting from a summer without rain, so that all the fish were dead, and
 the ships were stranded upon the shore, and it was possible to ford the
 stream even in the widest part.
 (vv. -.) after fording the thames, the army divided, some taking
 possession of the valley, and others occupying the high ground. those in
 the town take notice of them, and when they see approaching the wonderful
 array, bent upon reducing and taking the town, they prepare on their side
 to defend it. but before any assault is made, the king has the traitors
 drawn by four horses through the valleys and over the hills and unploughed
 fields. at this count angres is much distressed, when he sees those whom
 he held dear dragged around outside the town. and his people, too, are
 much dismayed, but in spite of the anxiety which they feel, they have no
 mind to yield the place. they must needs defend themselves, for the king
 makes it plain to all that he is angry, and ill-disposed, and they see
 that if he should lay hands upon them he would make them die a shameful
 death.
 (vv.-.) when the four had been torn asunder and their limbs lay
 strewn upon the field, then the assault begins. but all their labour is in
 vain, for no matter how much they cast and shoot, their efforts are of no
 effect. yet they strive to do their utmost, hurling their javelins amain,
 and shooting darts and bolts. on all sides is heard the din of cross-bows
 and slings as the arrows and the round stones fly thick, like rain mixed
 with hail. thus all day long the struggle of attack and defence continues,
 until the night separates them. and the king causes to be proclaimed what
 gift he will bestow upon him who shall effect the surrender of the town: a
 cup of great price weighing fifteen marks of gold, the richest in his
 treasure, shall be his reward. the cup will be very fine and rich, and, to
 tell the truth, the cup is to be esteemed for the workmanship rather than
 for the material of which it is made. but good as the workmanship may be,
 and fine though the gold, if the truth be told, the precious stones set in
 the outside of the cup were of most value. he through whose efforts the
 town shall be taken is to have the cup, if he be only a foot soldier; and
 if the town is taken by a knight, with the cup in his possession he shall
 never seek his fortune in vain, if there is any to be found in the world.
 (vv. -.) when this news was announced, alexander had not forgotten
 his custom of going to see the queen each evening. that night, too, he had
 gone thither and was seated beside the queen. soredamors was sitting alone
 close by them, looking at him with such satisfaction that she would not
 have exchanged her lot for paradise. the queen took alexander by the hand,
 and examined the golden thread which was showing the effects of wear; but
 the strand of hair was becoming more lustrous, while the golden thread was
 tarnishing. and she laughed as she happened to recall that the embroidery
 was the work of soredamors. alexander noticed this, and begged her to tell
 him, if suitable, why she laughed. the queen was slow to make reply, and
 looking toward soredamors, bade her come to her. gladly she went and knelt
 before her. alexander was overjoyed when he saw her draw so near that he
 could have touched her. but he is not so bold as even to look at her; but
 rather does he so lose his senses that he is well-nigh speechless. and
 she, for her part, is so overcome that she has not the use of her eyes;
 but she casts her glance upon the ground without fastening it upon
 anything. the queen marvels greatly at seeing her now pale, now crimson,
 and she notes well in her heart the bearing and expression of each of
 them. she notices and thinks she sees that these changes of colour are the
 fruit of love. but not wishing to embarrass them, she pretends to
 understand nothing of what she sees. in this she did well, for she gave no
 evidence of what was in her mind beyond saying: "look here, damsel, and
 tell us truly where the shirt was sewed that this knight has on, and if
 you had any hand in it or worked anything of yours into it." though the
 maiden feels some shame, yet she tells the story gladly; for she wishes
 the truth to be known by him, who, when he hears her tell of how the shirt
 was made, can hardly restrain himself for joy from worshipping and adoring
 the golden hair. his companions and the queen, who were with him, annoy
 him and embarrass him; for their presence prevents him from raising the
 hair to his eyes and mouth, as he would fain have done, had he not thought
 that it would be remarked. he is glad to have so much of his lady, but he
 does not hope or expect ever to receive more from her: his very desire
 makes him dubious. yet, when he has left the queen and is by himself, he
 kisses it more than a hundred thousand times, feeling how fortunate he is.
 all night long he makes much of it, but is careful that no one shall see
 him. as he lies upon his bed, he finds a vain delight and solace in what
 can give him no satisfaction. all night he presses the shirt in his arms,
 and when he looks at the golden hair, he feels like the lord of the whole
 wide world. thus love makes a fool of this sensible man, who finds his
 delight in a single hair and is in ecstasy over its possession. but this
 charm will come to an end for him before the sun's bright dawn. for the
 traitors are met in council to discuss what they can do; and what their
 prospects are. to be sure they will be able to make a long defence of the
 town if they determine so to do; but they know the king's purpose to be so
 firm that he will not give up his efforts to take the town so long as he
 lives, and when that time comes they needs must die. and if they should
 surrender the town, they need expect no mercy for doing so. thus either
 outcome looks dark indeed, for they see no help, but only death in either
 case. but this decision at last is reached, that the next morning, before
 dawn appears, they shall issue secretly from the town and find the camp
 disarmed, and the knights still sleeping in their beds. before they wake
 and get their armour on there will have been such slaughter done that
 posterity will always speak of the battle of that night. having no further
 confidence in life, the traitors as a last resort all subscribe to this
 design. despair emboldened them to fight, whatever the result might be;
 for they see nothing sure in store for them save death or imprisonment.
 such an outcome is not attractive; nor do they see any use in flight, for
 they see no place where they could find refuge should they betake
 themselves to flight, being completely surrounded by the water and their
 enemies. so they spend no more time in talk, but arm and equip themselves
 and make a sally by an old postern gate  toward
 the north-west, that being the side where they thought the camp would
 least expect attack. in serried ranks they sallied forth, and divided
 their force into five companies, each consisting of two thousand well
 armed foot, in addition to a thousand knights. that night neither star nor
 moon had shed a ray across the sky. but before they reached the tents, the
 moon began to show itself, and i think it was to work them woe that it
 rose sooner than was its wont. thus god, who opposed their enterprise,
 illumined the darkness of the night, having no love for these evil men,
 but rather hating them for their sin. for god hates traitors and treachery
 more than any other sin. so the moon began to shine in order to hamper
 their enterprise.
 (vv. -.) they are much hampered by the moon, as it shines upon
 their shields, and they are handicapped by their helmets, too, as they
 glitter in the moonlight. they are detected by the pickets keeping watch
 over the host, who now shout throughout the camp: "up, knights, up! rise
 quickly, take your arms and arm yourselves! the traitors are upon us."
 through all the camp they run to arms, and hastily strive to equip
 themselves in the urgent need; but not a single one of them left his place
 until they were all comfortably armed and mounted upon their steeds. while
 they are arming themselves, the attacking forces are eager for battle and
 press forward, hoping to catch them off their guard and find them
 disarmed. they bring up from different directions the five companies into
 which they had divided their troops: some hug the woods, others follow the
 river, the third company deploys upon the plain, while the fourth enters a
 valley, and the fifth proceeds beside a rocky cliff. for they planned to
 fall upon the tents suddenly with great fury. but they did not find the
 path clear. for the king's men resist them, defying them courageously and
 reproaching them for their treason. their iron lance-tips are splintered
 and shattered as they meet; they come together with swords drawn, striking
 each other and casting each other down upon the face. they rush upon each
 other with the fury of lions, which devour whatever they capture. in this
 first rush there was heavy slaughter on both sides. when they can no
 longer maintain themselves, help comes to the traitors, who are defending
 themselves bravely and selling their lives dearly. they see their troops
 from four sides arrive to succour them. and the king's men ride hard with
 spur to attack them. they deal such blows upon their shields that, beside
 the wounded, they unhorse more than five hundred of them. alexander, with
 his greeks, has no thought of sparing them, making every effort to prevail
 into the thickest of the fight he goes to strike a knave whose shield and
 hauberk are of no avail to keep him from falling to the earth. when he has
 finished with him, he offers his service to another freely and without
 stint, and serves him, too, so savagely that he drives the soul from his
 body quite, and leaves the apartment without a tenant. after these two, he
 addresses himself to another, piercing a noble and courteous knight clean
 through and through, so that the blood spurts out on the other side, and
 his expiring soul takes leave of the body. many he killed and many
 stunned, for like a flying thunderbolt he blasts all those whom he seeks
 out. neither coat of mail nor shield can protect him whom he strikes with
 lance or sword. his companions, too, are generous in the spilling of blood
 and brains, for they, too, know well how to deal their blows. and the
 royal troops butcher so many of them that they break them up and scatter
 them like low-born folk who have lost their heads. so many dead lay about
 the fields, and so long did the battle rage, that long before the day
 dawned the ranks were so cut in pieces that the rows of dead stretched for
 five leagues along the stream. count angres leaves his banner on the field
 and steals away, accompanied by only seven of his men. towards his town he
 made his way by a secret path, thinking that no one could see him. but
 alexander notices this, and sees them escaping from the troops, and he
 thinks that if he can slip away without the knowledge of any one, he will
 go to catch up with them. but before he got down into the valley, he saw
 thirty knights following him down the path, of whom six were greeks, and
 twenty-four were men of wales. these intended to follow him at a distance
 until he should stand in need of them. when alexander saw them coming, he
 stopped to wait for them, without failing to observe what course was taken
 by those who were making their way back to the town. finally, he saw them
 enter it. then he began to plan a very daring deed and a very marvellous
 design. and when he had made up his mind, he turned toward his companions
 and thus addressed them: "my lords," says he, "whether it be folly or
 wisdom, frankly grant me my desire if you care for my good-will." and they
 promised him never to oppose his will in aught. then he says: "let us
 change our outer gear, by taking the shields and lances from the traitors
 whom we have killed. thus, when we approach the town, the traitors within
 will suppose that we are of their party, and regardless of the fate in
 store for them, they will throw open the gates for us. and do you know
 what reward we shall offer them? if god so will we shall take them all
 dead or alive. now, if any of you repents of his promise, be sure that, so
 long as i live, i shall never hold him dear."
 (vv. -.) all the others grant his boon, and, despoiling the
 corpses of their shields, they arm themselves with them instead. the men
 within the town had mounted to the battlements, and, recognising the
 shields, suppose that they belong to their party, never dreaming of the
 ruse hidden beneath the shields. the gatekeeper opens the gate for them
 and admits them to the town. he is beguiled and deceived in not addressing
 them a word; for no one of them speaks to him, but silently and mute they
 pass, making such a show of grief that they trail their lances after them
 and support themselves upon their shields. thus it seems that they are in
 great distress, as they pass on at their own sweet will until they are
 within the triple walls. inside they find a number of men-at-arms and
 knights with the count. i cannot tell you just how many; but they were
 unarmed, except eight of them who had just returned from the fight, and
 even they were preparing to remove their arms. but their haste was ill
 considered; for now the other party make no further pretence, but without
 any challenge by way of warning, they brace themselves in the stirrups,
 and let their horses charge straight at them, attacking them with such
 rigour that they lay low more than thirty-one of them. the traitors in
 great dismay shout out: "we are betrayed, betrayed!" but the assailants
 take no heed of this, and let those whom they find unarmed feel the temper
 of their swords. indeed, three of those whom they found still armed were
 so roughly handled that but five remained alive. count angres rushed at
 calcedor, and in the sight of all struck him upon his golden shield with
 such violence that he stretched him dead upon the ground. alexander is
 greatly troubled, and is almost beside himself with rage when he sees his
 companion dead; his blood boils with anger, but his strength and courage
 are doubled as he strikes the count with such fury that he breaks his
 lance. if possible, he would avenge his friend. but the count was a
 powerful man and a good and hardy knight, whose match it would have been
 hard to find, had he not been a base traitor. he now returns the blow,
 making his lance double up so that it splits and breaks; but the other's
 shield holds firm, and neither gives way before the other any more than a
 rock would do, for both men were passing strong. but the fact that the
 count was in the wrong disturbs him greatly and troubles him. 
 the anger of each rises higher as they both draw their swords after their
 lances had been broken. no escape would have been possible if these two
 swordsmen had persisted in continuing the fight. but at last one or the
 other must die. the count dares not longer hold his ground, when he sees
 lying dead about him his men who had been caught unarmed. meanwhile the
 others press them hard, cutting, slashing, and carving them, spilling
 their brains, and reproaching the count for his treachery. when he hears
 himself accused of treason, he flees for safety to his tower, followed by
 his men. and their enemies follow after them, fiercely charging them from
 the rear, and not letting a single one escape of all upon whom they lay
 their hands. they kill and slay so many of them that i guess not more than
 seven made good their escape.
 (vv. -.) when they had got inside the tower, they made a stand at
 the gate; for those who were coming close behind had followed so closely
 after them that they too would have pressed in had the gateway been left
 exposed. the traitors make a brave defence, waiting for succour from their
 friends, who were arming themselves down in the town. but upon the advice
 of nabunal, who was a greek of great wisdom, the approach was blocked so
 that relief could not arrive in time; for those below had tarried too
 long, either from cowardice or sloth. now there was only one entrance to
 the stronghold; so that, if they stop that entrance-way, they need have no
 fear that any force shall approach to do them harm. nabunal bids and
 exhorts twenty of them to hold the gate; for soon such a company might
 arrive with force as would do them harm by their assault and attack. while
 these twenty hold the gate, the remaining ten should attack the tower and
 prevent the count from barricading himself inside. nabunal's advice is
 taken: ten remain to continue the assault at the entrance of the tower,
 while twenty go to defend the gate. in doing so, they delay almost too
 long; for they see approaching, furious and keen for the fight, a company
 containing many cross-bow men and foot soldiers of different grades who
 carried arms of divers sorts. some carried light missiles, and others
 danish axes, lances and turkish swords, bolts for cross-bows, arrows and
 javelins. the greeks would have had to pay a heavy score, if this crowd
 had actually fallen upon them; but they did not reach the place in time.
 nabunal by his foresight and counsel had blocked their plans, and they
 were forced to remain outside. when they see that they are shut out, they
 pause in their advance, as it is evident they can gain nothing by making
 an assault. then there begins such weeping and wailing of women and young
 children, of old men and youths, that those in the town could not have
 heard a thunder-clap from heaven. at this the greeks are overjoyed; for
 now they know of a certainty that the count by no good luck can escape
 capture. four of them mount the walls to keep watch lest those outside by
 any means or ruse should enter the stronghold and fall upon them. the
 remaining sixteen returned to where the ten were fighting. the day was
 already breaking, and the ten had fought so well that they had forced
 their way within the tower. the count took his stand against a post, and,
 armed with a battleaxe, defended himself with great bravery. those whom he
 reaches, he splits in half. and his men line up about him, and are not
 slow to avenge themselves in this last stand of the day, alexander's men
 have reason to complain, for of the original sixteen there remain now but
 thirteen. alexander is almost beside himself when he sees the havoc
 wrought among his dead or exhausted followers. yet his thoughts are fixed
 on vengeance: finding at hand a long heavy club, he struck one of the
 rascals with it so fiercely that neither shield nor hauberk was worth a
 button in preventing him from failing to the ground. after finishing with
 him, he pursues the count, and raising his club to strike him he deals him
 such a blow with his square club that the axe falls from his hands; and he
 was so stunned and bewildered that he could not have stood up unless he
 had leaned against the wall.
 (vv. -.) after this blow the battle ceases. alexander leaps at the
 count and holds him so that he cannot move. of the others nothing need be
 said, for they were easily mastered when they saw the capture of their
 lord. all are made prisoners with the count and led away in disgrace, in
 accordance with their deserts. of all this the men outside knew nothing.
 but when morning came they found their companions shields lying among the
 slain when the battle was over. then the greeks, misled, made a great
 lament for their lord. recognising his shield, all are in an agony of
 grief, swooning at sight of his shield and saying that now they have lived
 too long. cornix and nerius first swoon, then, recovering their senses,
 wish they were dead. so do torin and acorionde. the tears run down in
 floods from their eyes upon their breasts. life and joy seem hateful now.
 and parmenides more than the rest tore his hair in dire distress. no
 greater grief could be shown than that of these five for their lord. yet,
 their dismay is groundless, for it is another's body which they bear away
 when they think to have their lord. their distress is further increased by
 the sight of the other shields, which cause them to mistake these corpses
 for their companions. so over them they lament and swoon. but they are
 deceived by all these shields, for of their men only one was killed, whose
 name was neriolis. him, indeed, they would have borne away had they known
 the truth. but they are in as great anxiety for the others as for him; so
 they bore them all away. in every case but one they were misled. but like
 the man who dreams and takes a fiction for the truth, so the shields cause
 them to suppose this illusion to be a reality. it is the shields, then,
 that cause this mistake.  carrying the corpses, they
 move away and come to their tents, where there was a sorrowing troop. upon
 hearing the lament raised by the greeks, soon all the others gathered,
 until there was but one great outcry. now saredamors thinks of her
 wretched estate when she hears the cry and lament over her lover. their
 anguish and distress cause her to lose her senses and her colour, and her
 grief and sorrow are increased because she dares not openly show a trace
 of her distress. she shut up her grief within her heart. had any one
 looked at her, he could have seen by the expression of her face what agony
 she was in; but every one was so engrossed with his own sorrow that he had
 no care for another's grief. each one lamented his own loss. for they find
 the river bank covered with their relatives and friends, who had been
 wounded or roughly treated. each one wept for his own heavy and bitter
 loss: here is a son weeping for a father, there a father for a son; one
 swoons at the sight of his cousin, another over his nephew. thus fathers,
 brothers, and relatives bemoan their loss on every side. but above all is
 noticeable the sorrow of the greeks; and yet they might have anticipated
 great joy, for the deepest grief of all the camp will soon be changed into
 rejoicing.
 (vv. -.) the greeks outside continue their lament, while those
 inside strive to let them know the news which will cause them to rejoice.
 they disarm and bind their prisoners, who pray and beg of them to strike
 off their heads straightway. but the greeks are unwilling, and disdain
 their entreaties, saying that them will keep then under guard and hand
 them over to the king, who will grant them such recompense as shall
 require their services. when they had disarmed them all they made them go
 up on the wall that they might be seen by the troops below. this privilege
 is not to their liking, and when they saw their lord bound as a prisoner,
 they were unhappy men. alexander upon the walls swears to god and all the
 saints that he will not let one of them live, but will kill them all
 speedily, unless they will go to surrender to the king before he can seize
 them. "go," says he, "confidently to the king at my command, and cast
 yourselves upon his mercy. none of you, except the count, has deserved to
 die. you shall not lose either life or limb if you surrender to the king.
 if you do not deliver yourselves from death by crying for mercy, you need
 have little hope of saving your lives or bodies. go forth disarmed to meet
 the king, and tell him from me that alexander sends you to him. your
 action will not be in vain; for my lord the king is so gentle and
 courteous that he will lay aside his wrath and anger. but if you wish to
 act otherwise, you must expect to die, for his heart will be closed to
 pity." all agree in accepting this advice, and do not hesitate until they
 come to the king's tent, where they all fall at his feet. the story they
 told was soon known throughout the camp. the king and all his men mounted
 and spurred their horses to the town without delay.
 (vv. -.) alexander goes out from the town to meet the king, who
 was greatly pleased, and to surrender to him the count. the king did not
 delay in fitly punishing him. but alexander is congratulated and praised
 by the king and all the others who esteem him highly. their joy drives
 away the grief which they had felt not long before. but no joy of the
 others can compare with the exultation of the greeks. the king presents
 him with the precious cup, weighing fifteen marks, and tells him
 confidently that there is nothing in his possession so valuable that he
 would not place it in his hands upon request—save only the crown and
 the queen. alexander dares not mention his heart's desire, though he knows
 well that he would not be refused in asking for his sweetheart's hand. but
 he fears so much lest he might displease her, whose heart would have been
 made glad, that he prefers to suffer without her rather than to win her
 against her will. therefore, he asks for a little time, not wishing to
 prefer his request until he is sure of her pleasure. but he asked for no
 respite or delay in accepting the cup of gold. he takes the cup, and
 courteously begs my lord gawain to accept this cup as a gift from him,
 which gawain did most reluctantly. when soredamors learned the truth about
 alexander she was greatly pleased and delighted. when she heard that he
 was alive, she was so happy that it seemed to her as though she could
 never be sad again. but she reflects that he is slower in coming than is
 his wont. yet in good time she will have her wish, for both of them in
 rivalry are occupied with one common thought.
 (vv. -.) it seemed to alexander an age before he could feast his
 eyes with even one soft glance from her. long ago he would fain have gone
 to the queen's tent, if he had not been detained elsewhere. he was much
 put out by this delay, and as soon as he could, he betook himself to the
 queen in her tent. the queen went to greet him, and, without his having
 confided in her, she had already read his thoughts, and knew what was
 passing in his mind. she greets him at the entrance of the tent, and
 strives to make him welcome, well knowing for what purpose he has come.
 desirous of according him a favour, she beckons soredamors to join them,
 and they three engage in conversation at some distance from the rest. the
 queen first speaks, in whose mind there was no doubt that this couple were
 in love. of this fact she is quite sure, and is persuaded moreover that
 soredamors could not have a better lover. she took her place between the
 two and began to say what was appropriate.
 (vv. -.) "alexander," says the queen, "any love is worse than
 hate, when it torments and distresses its devotee. lovers know not what
 they do when they conceal their passion from one another. love is a
 serious business, and whoever does not boldly lay its foundation firm can
 hardly succeed in completing the edifice. they say there is nothing so
 hard to cross as the threshold. now i wish to instruct you in the lore of
 love; for i know well that love is tormenting you. therefore, i have
 undertaken to instruct you; and do you take good care not to keep anything
 back from me, for i have plainly seen in the faces of you both that of two
 hearts you have made but one. so beware, and conceal nothing from me! you
 are acting very foolishly in not speaking out your mind; for concealment
 will be the death of you; thus you will be the murderers of love. now i
 counsel you to exercise no tyranny, and to seek no passing gratification
 in your love; but to be honourably joined together in marriage. so, i
 believe, your love shall long endure. i can assure you that, if you agree
 to this, i will arrange the marriage."
 (vv. -.) when the queen had spoken her mind, alexander thus made
 reply: "lady," he says, "i enter no defence against the charge you make,
 but rather admit the truth of all you say. i wish never to be deserted by
 love, but always to fix my thoughts on it. i am pleased and delighted by
 what you have so kindly said. since you know what my wishes are, i see no
 reason why i should conceal them from you. long ago, if i had dared i
 would have confessed them openly; for the silence has been hard. but it
 may well be that for some reason this maiden may not wish that i be hers
 and she mine. but even if she grant me no rights over her, yet will i
 place myself in her hands." at these words she trembled, having no desire
 to refuse the gift. her heart's desire betrays itself in her words and her
 countenance. falteringly she gives herself to him, and says that without
 exception her will, her heart, and her body all is at the disposal of the
 queen, to do with her as she may please. the queen clasps them both in her
 arms, and presents one to the other. then laughingly she adds: "i give
 over to thee, alexander, thy sweetheart's body, and i know that thy heart
 does not draw back. whoever may like it or like it not, i give each of you
 to the other. do thou, soredamors, take what is thine, and thou,
 alexander, take what is thine!" now she has her own entire, and he has his
 without lack. at windsor that day, with the approval and permission of my
 lord gawain and the king, the marriage was celebrated. no one could tell,
 i am sure, so much of the magnificence and the food, of the pleasure and
 entertainment, at this wedding without falling short of the truth.
 inasmuch as it would be distasteful to some, i do not care to waste
 further words upon the matter, but am anxious to turn to another subject.
 (vv. -.) that day at windsor alexander had all the honour and
 happiness that he could desire. three different joys and honours were his:
 one was the town which he captured; another was the present of the best
 kingdom in wales, which king arthur had promised to give him when the war
 was over; that very day he made him king in his hall. but the greatest joy
 of all was the third—that his sweetheart was queen of the
 chess-board where he was king. before five months had passed, soredamors
 found herself with child, and carried it until the time was fulfilled. the
 seed remained in germ until the fruit was fully matured. no more beautiful
 child was ever born before or since than he whom they now called cliges.
 (vv. -.) so cliges was born, in whose honour this story has been
 put in the romance tongue. you shall hear me tell of him and of his
 valorous deeds, when he shall have grown to manhood and obtained a good
 report. but meanwhile in greece it came about that he who ruled over
 constantinople drew near his end. he died, as indeed he must, not being
 able to outlive his time. but before he died he assembled all the nobles
 of his land to send and seek for his son alexander, who was happily
 detained in britain. the messengers start out from greece, and begin their
 voyage over the seas; but a tempest catches them in its grasp, and damages
 their ship and company. they were all drowned at sea, except one
 unfaithful wretch, who was more devoted to alis the younger son than to
 alexander the eider. when he escaped from the sea, he returned to greece
 with the story that they had all been lost at sea as they were conducting
 their lord back from britain, and that he was the only survivor of the
 tragedy. they believed this lie of his, and, taking alis without objection
 or dissent, they crowned him emperor of greece. but it was not long before
 alexander learned that alis was emperor. then he took leave of king
 arthur, unwilling to let his brother usurp his land without protest. the
 king makes no opposition to his plan, but bids him take with him so great
 a company of welshmen, scots, and cornishmen that his brother will not
 dare to withstand him when he sees him come with such a host. alexander,
 had he pleased, might have led a mighty force; but he has no desire to
 harm his own people, if his brother will consent to do his will. he took
 with him forty knights besides soredamors and his son; these two persons,
 who were so dear to him, he did not wish to leave behind. escorted as far
 as shoreham by the entire court, they there embarked, and with fair winds
 their ship made way more quickly than a fleeing stag. within a month, i
 think, they arrived in port before athens, a rich and powerful city.
 indeed, the emperor was residing there, and had convoked, a great assembly
 of his noblemen. as soon as they arrived alexander sent a privy messenger
 into the city to learn whether they would receive him, or whether they
 would resist his claim to be their only lawful lord.
 (vv. -.) he who was chosen for this mission was a courteous knight
 with good judgment, named acorionde, a rich man and eloquent; he was a
 native of the country, too, having been born in athens. his ancestors for
 generations had always exercised lordship in the city. when he had learned
 that the emperor was in the city he went and challenged the crown on
 behalf of his brother alexander, accusing him openly of having usurped it
 unlawfully. arriving at the palace, he finds plenty of people who welcome
 him; but he says nothing to any of those who greet him until he learns
 what is their attitude and disposition toward their lawful lord. coming
 into the presence of the emperor he neither greets him nor bows before him
 nor calls him emperor. "alis," he says, "i bring thee tidings of
 alexander, who is out yonder in the harbour. listen to thy brother's
 message: he asks thee for what belongs to him, nor does he demand what is
 unjust. constantinople, which thou dost hold, should be his and shall be
 his. it would be neither just nor right that discord should arise between
 you two. so give him the crown without contest, for it is right that thou
 shouldst surrender it."
 (vv. -.) alis replies: "fair gentle friend, thou hast undertaken a
 mad enterprise in bearing this message. there is little comfort in thy
 speech, for well i know that my brother is dead. i should rejoice, indeed,
 to learn that he was still alive. but i shall not believe the news until i
 have seen him with my eyes. he died some time ago, alas! what thou sayest
 is not credible. and if he lives, why does he not come? he need never fear
 that i will not bestow on him some lands. he is a fool to hold aloof from
 me, for in serving me he will find profit. but no one shall possess the
 crown and empire beside me." he liked not the speech of the emperor, and
 did not fail to speak his mind in the reply he made. "alis," he says, "may
 god confound me if the matter is thus allowed to stand. i defy thee in thy
 brother's name, and dutifully speaking in his name, i summon all those
 whom i see here to renounce thee and to join his cause. it is right that
 they should side with him and recognise him as their lord. let him who is
 loyal now stand forth."
 (vv. -.) upon saying this he leaves the court, and the emperor
 summons those in whom he has most confidence. he requests their advice
 concerning this defiance upon his brother's part, and wishes to learn if
 he can trust them to lend no support or help to his brother's claim. thus
 he tries to test the loyalty of each; but he finds not one who sides with
 him in the dispute, rather do they all bid him remember the war which
 eteocles undertook against his own brother polynices, and how each one
 died by the other's hand.  "so, too, it may happen to
 you, if you undertake a war, and all the land will be distressed."
 therefore, they advise that such a peace be sought as shall be both
 reasonable and just, and that neither one make excessive demands. thus
 alis understands that if he does not make an equitable agreement with his
 brother all his vassals will desert him; so he says that he will respect
 their wishes in making any suitable contract, provided that however the
 affair may rum out the crown shall remain in his possession.
 (vv. -.) in order to secure a firm and stable peace alis sends one
 of his officers to alexander, bidding him come to him in person and
 receive the government of the land, but stipulating that he should leave
 to him the honour of emperor in name and of wearing the crown: thus, if
 alexander is willing, peace may be established between them. when this
 news was brought to alexander his men made ready with him and came to
 athens, where they were received with joy. but alexander is not willing
 that his brother should have the sovereignty of the empire and of the
 crown unless he will pledge his word never to take a wife, and that after
 him cliges shall be emperor of constantinople. upon this the brothers both
 agreed. alexander dictated the terms of the oath, and his brother agreed
 and gave his word that he would never in his life take a wife in marriage.
 so peace is made, and they are friends again, to the great satisfaction of
 the lords. they hold alis as their emperor, but all business is referred
 to alexander. what he commands is done, and little is done except through
 him. alis has nothing but the name of emperor; but alexander is served and
 loved; and he who does not serve him for love must needs do so from fear.
 through the effect of one or the other of these two motives he has all the
 land within his power. but he whom they call death spares neither the
 strong man nor the weak, but kills and slays them all. so alexander had to
 die; for a disease caught him in its grip from which he could obtain no
 relief. but before he was surprised by death he summoned his son and said
 to him: "fair son cliges, thou canst never know that prowess and valour
 are thine unless thou go first to make test of them with the bretons and
 french at king arthur's court. if adventure takes thee thither, so conduct
 and demean thyself that thy identity be not known until thou hast tried
 thy strength with the most excellent knights of that court. i beg thee to
 heed my counsel in this matter, and if the occasion arises have no fear to
 measure thy skill with thy uncle, my lord gawain. do not forget this
 advice, i pray."
 (vv. -.) after he had thus exhorted him, he did not live long.
 soredamors' grief was such that she could not survive him, but died after
 him of a broken heart. alis and cliges both mourned him becomingly, but
 finally they ceased their grief, for sorrow, like everything else, must be
 outlived. to continue in sorrow is wrong, for no good can come from it. so
 the mourning was ended, and the emperor refrained for a long time from
 taking a wife, being careful of his word. but there is no court in all the
 world which is free from evil counsel. great men often go astray, and do
 not observe loyalty because of the bad advice they take. thus, the emperor
 hears his men giving him advice and counselling him to take a wife; and
 daily they so exhort and urge him that by their very insistence they
 persuade him to break his oath, and to accede to their desire. but he
 insists that she who is to be mistress of constantinople must be gentle,
 fair, wise, rich, and noble. then his counsellors say that they wish to
 prepare to go away to the german land, and seek the daughter of the
 emperor. she is the choice they propose to him; for the emperor of germany
 is very rich and powerful, and his daughter is so charming that never was
 there a maid of her beauty in christendom. the emperor grants them full
 authority, and they set out upon the journey well provided with all they
 need. they proceeded on their way until they found the emperor at
 regensburg, when they asked him to give them his oldest daughter at the
 instance of their lord.
 (vv. -.) the emperor was pleased with this request, and gladly
 gave them his daughter; for in doing so, he does not debase himself, nor
 diminish his honour in any way. but he says that he had promised her to
 the duke of saxony, and that they would not be able to lead her away
 unless the emperor should come with a great army, so that the duke would
 be unable to do him any harm or injury while homeward bound.
 (vv. -.) when the messengers heard the emperor's reply, they took
 leave and departed. they returned to their lord, and bore him the answer.
 and the emperor selected a chosen company of the most experienced knights
 whom he could find, and took with him his nephew, in whose interests he
 had vowed never to marry a wife, but he will not respect this vow if he
 can once reach cologne.  upon a certain day he leaves
 greece and draws near to germany, intending to take a wife despite all
 blame and reproach; but his honour will be smirched. upon reaching
 cologne, he found that the emperor had assembled all his court for a
 festival. when the company of the greeks reached cologne, there was such a
 great number of greeks and germans that it was necessary to lodge more
 than sixty thousand of them outside the city.
 (vv.-.) great was the crowd of people, and great the joy of the
 two emperors when they met. when the barons had gathered in the vast
 palace, the emperor summoned his charming daughter. the maiden made no
 delay in coming straightway into the palace. she had been made very fair
 and shapely by the creator, whose pleasure it had been to arouse the
 people's admiration. god, who had fashioned her, never gave man a word
 which could adequately express such beauty as she possessed.
 (vv. -.) fenice was the maiden's name, and for this there was good
 reason: 
 for if the phoenix bird is unique as the most beautiful of all the birds,
 so fenice, it seems to me, had no equal in beauty. she was such a miracle
 and marvel that nature was never able to make her like again. in order to
 be more brief, i will not describe in words her arms, her body, her head
 and hands; for if i should live a thousand years, and if my skill were to
 double every day, yet should i waste all my time in trying to tell the
 truth about her. i know very well, if i should undertake it, that i would
 exhaust my brain and waste my pains: it would be but misspent energy. 
 the damsel hastened until she came into the palace, with head uncovered
 and face unveiled; and the radiance of her beauty lighted the palace more
 brightly than four carbuncles would have done. cliges stood, his
 over-cloak removed, in his uncle's presence. the day outside was somewhat
 dark, but he and the maiden were both so fair that a ray shone forth from
 their beauty which illumined the palace, just as the morning sun shines
 clear and red.
 (vv. -.) i wish to attempt in a very few words to describe the
 beauty of cliges. he was in his flower, being now almost fifteen years of
 age. he was more comely and charming than narcissus who saw his reflection
 in the spring beneath the elm-tree, and, when he saw it, he loved it so
 that he died, they say, because he could not get it. narcissus was fair,
 but had little sense;  but as fine gold surpasses
 copper, so was cliges better endowed with wisdom, and even then i have not
 said all. his locks seemed made of fine gold, and his face was of a fresh
 rosy colour. he had a well-formed nose and shapely mouth, and in stature
 he was built upon nature's best pattern; for in him she had united gifts
 which she is wont to scatter wide. nature was so lavish with him that she
 gave him all she could, and placed all in one receptacle. such was cliges,
 who combined good sense and beauty, generosity and strength. he possessed
 the wood as well as the bark; he knew more of fencing and of the bow than
 did tristan, king mark's nephew, and more about birds and hounds than he.
 in cliges there lacked no good thing.
 (vv. -.) cliges stood in all his beauty before his uncle, and
 those who did not know who he was looked at him with eager curiosity. and
 on the other hand, the interest was aroused of those who did not know the
 maiden: wonderingly they gaze upon her. but cliges, under the sway of
 love, let his eyes rest on her covertly, and withdrew them again so
 discreetly that in their passage to and fro no one could blame his lack of
 skill. blithely he looks upon the maid, but does not note that she repays
 him in kind. not flattering him, but in sincere love, she gives him her
 eyes, and takes back his. this exchange seems good to her, and would have
 seemed to her better still had she known something of who he was. but she
 knows nothing except that he is fair, and that, if she is ever to love any
 one for beauty's sake, she need not seek elsewhere to bestow her heart.
 she handed over to him the possession of her eyes and heart, and he
 pledged his in turn to her. pledged? rather gave outright. gave? nay, upon
 my faith, i lie; for no one can give away his heart. i must express it
 some other way. i will not say it, as some have done who make two hearts
 dwell in one body, for it bears not even the semblance of truth that there
 should be in one body two hearts; and even if they could be so united, it
 would never seem true. but if it please you to heed my words, i shall be
 able explain how two hearts form but one without coming to be identified.
 only so far are they merged in one as the desire of each passes from one
 to the other, thus joining in one common desire; and because of this
 harmony of desire, there are some who are wont to say that each one has
 both hearts; but one heart cannot be in two places. each one always keeps
 his own heart, though the desire be shared by both, just as many different
 men may sing a song or tune in unison. by this comparison i prove that for
 one body to contain two hearts it is not enough to know each other's wish,
 nor yet for one to know what the other loves and what he hates; just as
 voices which are heard together seem to be merged in one, and yet do not
 all come from one mouth, so it is with a body which can contain but one
 heart. but there is no need of further argument, for other matters press
 upon me. i must speak now of the damsel and of cliges, and you shall hear
 of the duke of saxony, who has sent to cologne a young nephew of his. this
 youth informs the emperor that his uncle, the duke, sends word that he
 need expect no peace or trace with him, unless he sends to him his
 daughter, and that the one who is intending to carry her away with him had
 better not start home, for he will find the road occupied and well
 defended unless the maiden be surrendered.
 (vv. -.) the youth spoke his message well, without pride and
 without insult. but he found neither knight nor emperor who would answer
 him. when he saw that they all held their peace and treated him with
 scorn, he left the court in defiant mood. but youth and thirst for daring
 deeds made cliges defy him in combat as he left. for the contest they
 mount their steeds, three hundred of them on either side, exactly equal
 thus in strength. all the palace is quite emptied of knights and ladies,
 who mount to the balconies, battlements, and windows to see and watch
 those who were about to fight. even the maiden, whose will love had
 subdued beneath his sway, sought for a point from which to see. she took
 her place at a window, where she sat with great delight, because from
 there she could get a view of him whom she holds secretly in her heart
 with no desire to remove him thence; for she will never love any other
 man. but she does not know his name, nor who he is, nor of what race; for
 it is not proper to ask questions; but she yearns to hear tidings which
 will bring joy to her heart. she looks out of the window at the shields
 with their gleaming gold, and she gazes at those who wear the shields
 about their necks, as they prepare for the trial at arms. but all her
 thoughts and glances soon rest upon one object, and to all others she is
 indifferent. whereever cliges goes, she seeks to follow him with her eyes.
 and he in turn does his best for her, and battles openly, in order that
 she at least may hear it said that he is bold and very skilled: thus she
 will be compelled to prize him for his prowess. he attacks the duke's
 nephew, who was breaking many a lance and sorely discomfiting the greeks.
 but cliges, who is displeased at this, braces himself firmly in his
 stirrups, and goes to strike him so speedily that in spite of himself he
 had to vacate the saddle-bows. when he got up, the uproar was great; for
 the youth arose and mounted, thinking to avenge his shame. but many a man
 only falls into deeper disgrace who thinks to avenge his shame when he has
 the chance. the young man rushes at cliges, who lowers his lance to meet
 him, and thrusts at him with such force that he carries him to earth
 again. now his shame is doubled, and all his followers are in dismay,
 seeing that they can never leave the field with honour; for not one of
 them is so valiant that he can keep his seat in the saddle when cliges
 thrust reaches him. but those of germany and the greeks are overjoyed when
 they see their party drive off the saxons, who retreat discomfited. with
 mockery they pursue them until they come up with them at a stream, into
 which they drive them for a plunge. in the deepest part of the ford cliges
 unhorsed the duke's nephew and so many of his men that they escaped
 grieving and sad in their shame and confusion. but cliges, twice victor,
 returned in glee, and entered a gate which was near the apartment where
 the maiden was; and as he passed through the gate she exacted as toll a
 tender glance, which he paid her as their eyes met. thus was the maiden
 subdued by the man. but there is not a german of the lowland or highland,
 possessing the power of speech who does not cry: "god! who is this in whom
 such beauty is radiant? god! how has it happened that so suddenly he has
 attained such great success?" thus one man and another asks: "who is this
 youth, who is he, i say?" thus, soon throughout the city it is known what
 his name is, and who is his father, and what pledge that was which had
 been made to him by the emperor. so much was said and noised about that
 the news reached the ears of her who in her heart rejoiced because she
 could no more say that love had made sport of her, nor had she any ground
 for complaint. for love has made her give her heart to the fairest, most
 courteous, and valiant man that could anywhere be found. but some force
 must be employed, if she would gain possession of him who is not free do
 her will. this makes her anxious and distraught. for she has no one with
 whom to take counsel concerning him for whom she pines, but must waste
 herself in thought and vigils. she becomes so affected by these cares that
 she loses her colour and grows wan, and it becomes plain to all that her
 loss of colour betokens an unfulfilled desire. she plays less now than she
 used to do, and laughs less and loses her gaiety. but she conceals her
 trouble and passes it off, if any one asks what her ailment is. her old
 nurse's name was thessala,  who was skilled in necromancy,
 having been born in thessaly, where devilish charms are taught and
 wrought; for the women of that country perform many a charm and mystic
 rite.
 (vv. -.) thessala saw pale and wan her whom love holds in his
 bonds, and thus she addressed her with advice: "god!" she said, "are you
 bewitched, my lady dear, that your face should be so pale? i wonder what
 your trouble is. tell me, if you can, where this pain attacks you most,
 for if any one can cure you, you may safely trust me to give you back your
 health again. i can cure the dropsy, gout, quinsy, and asthma; i am so
 expert in examining the urine and the pulse that you need consult no other
 physician. and i dare say that i know more than ever medea 
 knew of enchantments and of charms which tests have proven to be true. i
 have never spoken to you of this, though i have cared for you all your
 life; and now i should not mention it did i not plainly see that you are
 so afflicted as to need my ministrations. my lady, you will do well to
 tell me what your sickness is before its hold becomes more severe. the
 emperor has committed you to me in order that i may care for you, and my
 devotion has been such that i have kept you safe and sound. now all my
 pains will come to naught if i do not relieve this malady. take care not
 to conceal from me whether this is sickness or something else." the damsel
 dares not openly expose her desire in all its fullness for she is in fear
 lest she be disapproved and blamed. and when she hears and understands how
 thessala boasts and highly rates herself as being expert in enchantments,
 charms, and potions, she decides to tell her what is the cause of her pale
 and colourless face; but first she makes her promise to keep her secret
 and never to oppose her will.
 (vv. -.) "nurse," she said, "i truly thought i felt no pain, but i
 shall soon feel differently. for as soon as i begin to think about it, i
 feel great pain, and am dismayed. but when one has no experience, how can
 one tell what is sickness and what is health? my illness is different from
 all others; for when i wish to speak of it, it causes me both joy and
 pain, so happy i am in my distress. and if it can be that sickness brings
 delight, then my trouble and joy are one, and in my illness consists my
 health. so i do not know why i complain, for i know not whence my trouble
 comes, unless it is caused by my desire. perchance my desire is my
 disease, but i find so much joy in it that the suffering it causes me is
 grateful, and there is so much contentment in my pain that it is sweet to
 suffer so. nurse thessala, now tell me true, is not this a deceitful ill,
 to charm and torment me both at once? i do not see how i can tell whether
 this is a disease or not. nurse, tell me now its name, nature, and
 character. but understand well that i have no desire to be cured of it,
 for my distress is very dear to me." thessala, who was very wise about
 love and its symptoms knows full well from what she hears that it is love
 which is tormenting her; the tender, endearing terms she uses are certain
 proof that she is in love, for all other woes are hard to bear, except
 that alone which comes from love; but love transforms its bitterness into
 sweetness and joy, then often transforms them back again. the nurse, who
 was expert in this matter, thus replies to her: "have no fear, for i will
 tell you at once the name of your malady. you told me, i believe, that the
 pain which you feel seems rather to be joy and health: now of such a
 nature is love-sickness, for in it, too, there is joy and bliss. you are
 in love, then, as i can prove to you, for i find no pleasure in any malady
 save only in love. all other sickness is always bad and horrible, but love
 is sweet and peaceable. you are in love; of that i am sure, nor do i see
 any wrong in that. but i shall consider it very wrong, if through some
 childish folly you conceal from me your heart." "nurse, there is no need
 of your speaking so. but first i must be sure and certain that under no
 circumstances will you speak of it to any living soul." "my lady, surely
 the winds will speak of it before i do without your leave, and i will give
 you my word so to favour your desires that you may safely trust in having
 your joy fulfilled through my services." "in that case, nurse, i shall be
 cured. but the emperor is giving me in marriage, wherefore i grieve and am
 sorrowful; for he who has won my heart is the nephew of him whom i must
 take. and though he may find joy in me, yet is my joy forever lost, and no
 respite is possible. i would rather be torn limb from limb than that men
 should speak of us as they speak of the loves of iseut and tristan, of so
 many unseemly stories are told that i should be ashamed to mention them. i
 could never bring myself to lead the life that iseut led. such love as
 hers was far too base; for her body belonged to two, whereas her heart was
 possessed by one. thus all her life was spent, refusing her favours to
 neither one. but mine is fixed on one object, and under no circumstances
 will there be any sharing of my body and heart. never will my body be
 portioned out between two shareholders. who has the heart has the body,
 too, and may bid all others stand aside. but i cannot clearly see how he
 whom i love can have my body when my father gives me to another, and his
 will i do not dare resist. and when this other is lord of my body, and
 does something which displeases me, it is not right for me to summon
 another to my aid. nor can this man marry a wife without breaking his
 plighted word; for, unless injustice be done, cliges is to have the empire
 after his uncle's death. but i should be well served by you, if you were
 so skilful as to present him, to whom i am pledged and engaged, from
 having any claim upon me. o nurse, exert yourself to the end that he may
 not break the pledge which he gave to the father of cliges, when he
 promised him solemnly never to take a wife in marriage. for now, if he
 should marry me his promise would be broken. but cliges is so dear to me
 that i would rather be under ground than that he should ever lose through
 me a penny of the fortune which should be his. may never a child be born
 to me to cause his disinheritance! nurse, now do your best, and i will
 always be your slave." then the nurse tells her and assures her that she
 will cast so many charms, and prepare so many potions and enchantments
 that she need never have any worry or fear concerning the emperor after he
 shall have drunk of the potion which she will give him; even when they
 shall lie together and she be at his side, she may be as secure as if
 there were a wall between them. "but do not be alarmed, if, in his sleep,
 he sports with you, for when he is plunged in sleep he will have his sport
 with you, and he will be convinced that he has had you when wide awake,
 nor will he think it is all a dream, a fiction, and illusion. thus he will
 have his sport with you when asleep, he will think he is awake."
 (vv. -.) the maiden is highly pleased and delighted by the nurse's
 kindness and offer of help. her nurse inspires good hope in her by the
 promise which she makes, and which she binds herself to keep; with this
 hope she expects to obtain her desire, in spite of wearisome delay, for if
 cliges' nature is as noble as she takes it to be he cannot fail to take
 pity upon her when he learns that she loves him, and that she has imposed
 virginity upon herself in order to insure his inheritance. so the maiden
 believes her nurse, and puts full confidence in her. one promises to the
 other, and gives her word, that this plot shall be kept so secret as never
 to be revealed. at this point their conversation ceases, and the next
 morning the emperor summons his daughter. at his command she goes to him.
 but why should i weary you with details? the two emperors have so settled
 the matter that the marriage is solemnised, and joy reigns in the palace.
 but i do not wish to stop to describe all this in detail. rather will i
 address myself to thessala, as she diligently prepares and tempers her
 potions.
 (vv. -.) thessala steeps her drink, putting in spices in abundance
 to sweeten and temper it. after having well beaten and mixed it, she
 strains it clear, with no sharp or bitter taste, for the spices she puts
 in give it a sweet and pleasant fragrance. when the potion was prepared,
 the day had drawn to a close, the tables were set for supper, and the
 cloths were spread. but thessala delays the supper, because she must
 discover by what device and what agent she can have the potion served. at
 supper, finally, all were seated, and more than six dishes had been
 passed, and cliges served behind his uncle's place. thessala, as she
 watches him, thinks how ill he serves his own interests, and how he is
 assisting in his own disinheritance, and the thought torments and worries
 her. then in her kindness she conceives the plan of having the potion
 served by him to whom it will bring both joy and honour. so thessala
 summoned cliges; and when he had come to her, he asked her why she had
 sent for him. "friend," said she, "i wish to present the emperor at this
 meal with a beverage which he will esteem highly, and i want him to taste
 no other to-night, either at supper or when he goes to bed. i think he
 cannot fail to relish it, for he never has tasted a better drink or one
 that has cost so much. and i warn you, take good care to let no one else
 drink of it, for there is but a little of it. and this, too, i beg of you,
 not to let him know whence it came; but tell him it came about by chance
 that you found it among the presents, and tasted it yourself, and detected
 the aroma of the sweet spices in the air; then, seeing the wine to be all
 clear you poured it into his cup. if by chance he should inquire, you can
 satisfy him with this reply. but have no suspicion yourself, after what i
 have said, for the drink is pure and healthful, full excellent spices, and
 i think it may some day bring you joy." when he heard that advantage would
 come to him, he took the potion and went away, for he did not know there
 was any harm in it. he set it in a crystal cup before the emperor, who
 took it without question, trusting in his nephew. after taking a long
 draught of the beverage, he straightway feels its strength, as it descends
 from head to heart, and rises again from heart to head, and penetrates
 every part of him without doing the slightest harm. and by the time they
 left the tables, the emperor had drunk so much of the pleasing drink that
 he can never escape it influence. every night he will sleep under its
 influence, and its effects will be such that he will think he is awake
 when sound asleep.
 (vv. -.) now the emperor has been deceived. many bishops and
 abbots were present to bless and hallow the marriage-bed. when the time
 came to retire, the emperor, as was his right, lay beside his wife that
 night. "as was his right;" but the statement is inexact, for he neither
 kissed nor fondled her, yet they lay together in one bed. at first the
 maiden trembled with fear and anxiety lest the potion should not act. but
 it has so mastered him that he will never desire her or any other woman
 except in his sleep. but when asleep he will have such sport with her as
 one may have in dreams, and he will think the dream is true. nevertheless,
 she is on her guard, and at first, holds aloof from him, so that he cannot
 approach her. but now he must needs fall asleep; then he sleeps and
 dreams, though, the senses are awake, and he exerts himself to win the
 favours of the maid, while she, realising the danger, defends her
 virginity. he woos her and calls her gently his sweetheart, and thinks he
 possesses her, but in vain. but he is gratified by this vain semblance,
 embracing, kissing, and fondling an empty thing, seeing and speaking to no
 purpose, struggling and striving without effect. surely the potion was
 effective in thus possessing and mastering him. all his pains are of no
 avail, as he thinks and is persuaded that the fortress is won. thus he
 thinks and is convinced, when he desists after his vain efforts. but now i
 may say once for all that his satisfaction was never more than this. to
 such relations with her he will for ever be condemned if indeed he can
 lead her to his own land; but before he can get her to safety, i judge
 that there is trouble in store for him. for while he is on his journey
 home, the duke, to whom his bride had been betrothed, will appear upon the
 scene. the duke gathered a numerous force, and garrisoned the frontiers,
 while at court he had his spies to inform him each day of the emperor's
 doings and preparations, and how long they are going to stay, and by what
 route they intend to return. the emperor did not tarry long after the
 marriage, but left cologne in high spirits. the german emperor escorted
 him with a numerous company, fearing and dreading the force of the duke of
 saxony.
 (vv. -.) the two emperors pursued their journey until they were
 beyond regensburg, where one evening they were encamped in a meadow by the
 danube. the greeks were in their tents in the fields bordering upon the
 black forest. opposite to them the saxons were lodged, spying upon them.
 the duke's nephew stood alone upon a hill, whence he could reconnoitre for
 a chance to inflict some loss or harm on the enemy. from that point of
 vantage he espied cliges with three of his young men disporting themselves
 with lances and shields, eager for a conflict and shock of arms. if he
 could get the chance the duke's nephew would gladly attack them and do
 them harm. starting out with five companions he concealed them in a valley
 close by a wood, so that the greeks never saw them until they emerged from
 the valley; then the duke's nephew made an attack, and striking cliges,
 wounded him slightly in the back. cliges, bending over, avoids the lance
 which passed him, inflicting only a slight hurt.
 (vv. -.) when cliges felt himself wounded, he charged the youth,
 and struck him with such force that he drove his lance quite through his
 heart, and stretched him dead. then all the saxons in fear of him betook
 themselves to flight through the woods. and cliges, ignorant of the
 ambuscade, courageously but imprudently leaving his companions behind,
 pursues them to the place where the duke's troops were in force preparing
 to attack the greeks. alone he goes in hot pursuit after the youths, who,
 in despair over their lord whom they had lost, come running to the duke
 and tell him weeping of his nephew's death. the duke saw no joke in this
 affair; and, swearing by god and all his saints that he will take no joy
 or pride in life so long as the slayer of his nephew remains alive, he
 adds that whoever will bring him his head will be his friend and will
 serve him well. then a knight made boast that if he can find the guilty
 man, he will present him with cliges' head. cliges follows the young men
 until he falls among the saxons, when he is seen by him who had undertaken
 to carry off his head, and who starts after him without delay. but cliges
 haste had turned back to escape from his enemies and came in to where he
 had left his companions; he found none there, for they had returned to
 camp to relate their adventure. and the emperor ordered to horse the
 greeks and germans in one band. soon all through the camp the knights are
 arming and mounting. meanwhile cliges is hotly pursued by his enemy, all
 armed and with helmet closed. cliges, who never wished to be numbered
 among the coward and craven-hearted, notices that he comes alone. first,
 the knight challenged him, calling him "fellow," unable to conceal his
 rage: "young fellow," he cried, "thou shalt leave me here a pledge for my
 lord whom thou hast killed. if i do not carry away thy head with me, i am
 not worth a counterfeit besant. i must make of it a present to the duke,
 and will accept no other forfeit. in return for his nephew, i shall make
 such restitution that he will profit by the exchange." cliges hears him
 reproaching him thus boldly and with impudence. "vassal," he says, "be on
 your guard! for i will defend my head, and you shall not get it without my
 leave." then the attack begins. the other missed his blow, while cliges
 struck him with such force that horse and rider went down together in one
 heap. the horse fell upon him so heavily that he shattered completely one
 of his legs. cliges dismounted on the greensward and disarmed him. when he
 had disarmed him, he appropriated his weapons, and cut off his enemy's
 head with the sword which had just now been his. after severing his head
 he fixed it firmly on the point of his lance, thinking to offer it to the
 duke, to whom his nephew had promised to present his own if he could meet
 him in the strife. cliges had no sooner put on the dead man's helmet and
 taken his shield and mounted his steed, letting his own stray at large to
 terrify the greeks, than he saw advancing with more than a hundred banners
 flying several full squadrons of greeks and germans. now the fierce and
 cruel struggles will soon begin between the saxons and the greeks. as soon
 as cliges sees his men advancing, he betakes himself toward the saxons,
 his own men hotly pursuing him, and not knowing him in his disguise. it is
 no wonder that his uncle is in despair and fear, when he sees the head he
 is carrying off. so all the host pursue him fast, while cliges leads them
 on to provoke a fight, until the saxons see him drawing near. but they,
 too, are quite misled by the arms with which he has armed and equipped
 himself. he succeeds in deceiving and mocking them; for the duke and all
 the rest, when they saw him approaching lance in rest, cried out: "here
 comes our knight! on the point of his lance he carries cliges' head, and
 the greeks are hotly pursuing him!" then, as they give their horses rein,
 cliges spurs to meet the saxons, crouching low beneath his shield, the
 lance out straight with the head affixed. now, though he was braver than a
 lion, he was no stronger than any other man. both parties think that he is
 dead, and while the saxons rejoice, the greeks and germans grieve. but
 before long the truth will out. for cliges no longer held his peace: but,
 rushing fiercely at a saxon, he struck him with his ashen lance upon the
 head and in the breast, so that he made him lose his stirrups, and at the
 same time he cried aloud: "strike gentlemen, for i am cliges whom you
 seek. come on, my bold and hardy knights! let none hold back, for the
 first joust is already won! he is a coward who does not relish such a
 dish."
 (vv. -.) the emperor's joy was great when he heard the voice of
 his nephew cliges summoning and exhorting them; he was greatly pleased and
 comforted. but the duke is greatly chagrined now when he sees he is
 betrayed, unless his force should prove the stronger. while he draws
 together his troops in serried lines, the greeks do the same, and pressing
 them close, attack and rush upon them. on both sides lances are lowered as
 they meet for the proper reception of a hostile host. at the first shock
 shields are pierced and lances shattered, girths are cut and stirrups
 broken, while the horses of those who fall to earth are left without a
 rider. but regardless of what any other does, cliges and the duke meet in
 the fray; holding their lances low, they strike one another upon the
 shield with such violence that the strong and well-made lances fly into
 splinters. cliges was skilful on horseback, and sits straight in his
 saddle without shaking or losing his balance. but the duke has lost his
 seat, and in spite of himself quits the saddle-bows. cliges struggled and
 strove to capture him and carry him away, but his strength did not
 suffice, for the saxons were around about fighting to rescue him.
 nevertheless, cliges escapes from the conflict without receiving harm and
 with a precious prize; for he makes off with the duke's steed, which was
 whiter than wool, and was worth more to a gentleman than the fortune of
 octavian  at rome. the steed was an
 arabian. the greeks and germans are overjoyed to see cliges on such a
 mount, for they had already remarked the excellence and beauty of the arab
 steed. but they were not on their guard against an ambuscade; and before
 they are aware of it great damage will be done.
 (vv. -.) a spy came to the duke, bringing him welcome news.
 "duke," says the spy, "not a man remains in all the encampment of the
 greeks who is able to defend himself. if thou wilt take my word for it,
 now is the time to have the emperor's daughter seized, while the greeks
 are seen intent upon the battle and the strife. lend me a hundred of thy
 knights, and i will put the lady in their hands. by an old and secluded
 path i will lead them so carefully that they will not be seen or met by
 any man of germany, until they can seize the damsel in her tent and carry
 her off so handily that no resistance will be made." at this the duke is
 highly pleased. he sent a hundred and more tried knights with the spy, who
 so successfully conducted them that they carried the maiden away captive
 without exerting any force; for they could abduct her easily. after
 carrying her some distance from the tents, they send her on under escort
 of twelve of their number whom they accompany but a short distance. while
 the twelve led the damsel on, the others went to tell the duke how
 successful they had been. the duke's desire being now satisfied, he at
 once makes a truce with the greeks until next day. the truce was sworn by
 both parties. the duke's men then turned back, while the greeks without
 delay repaired each man to his own tent. but cliges stays behind alone,
 stationed upon a little hill where no one caught sight of him, until he
 saw the twelve pass by with her whom they were carrying off at topmost
 speed. cliges, in his thirst for glory, rides at them without delay; for
 he thinks within himself, and his heart tells him, that it is not for
 nothing that they flee. so, as soon as he espied them, he spurred after
 them; and when they saw him coming on, a foolish thought occurred to them:
 "it is the duke," they said, "who comes. let us rein in a little; for he
 has left the troops and is riding hard after us alone." every man thinks
 that so it is. they all want to turn back to meet him, but each one wishes
 to go alone. meanwhile, cliges must needs descend a deep valley between
 two mountains. he would never have recognised their blazons, if they had
 not come to meet him, or if they had not awaited him. six of the twelve
 come to meet him in an encounter they will soon regret. the other six stay
 with the damsel, leading her gently at a walk and easy jog. and the six
 ride quickly on, spurring up the valley, until he who had the swiftest
 horse reached him first and cried aloud: "hail, duke of saxony! god bless
 thee! duke, we have recovered thy lady. the greeks shall not get her now,
 for she shall be placed in thy hands." when cliges heard the words this
 fellow shouts, his heart is not gay; rather is it strange that he does not
 lose his wits. never was any wild beast—leopard, tiger, or lion—upon
 seeing its young captured, so fierce and furious as cliges, who sets no
 value upon his life if he deserts his sweetheart now. he would rather die
 than not win her back. in his trouble he feels great wrath, which gives
 him the courage he requires. he urges and spurs the arab steed, and rushes
 to give the saxon such a blow upon his painted shield that without
 exaggeration, he makes his heart feel the lance. this gives cliges
 confidence. he drove and spurred the arab charger on for more than the
 space of an acre before he came upon the next saxon, for they came up
 singly, each fearless of his predecessor's fare, for cliges fights them
 one by one. as he takes them thus individually, no one receives another's
 aid. he makes a rush at the second one, who, like the first, thought to
 give him joy by telling him of his own evil fate. but cliges has no
 concern to heed his talk and idle charter. thrusting his lance into his
 body so that the blood spurts out when it is withdrawn, he deprives him of
 life and the gift of speech. after these two he meets the third, who
 expects to find him in good humour and to make him rejoice over his own
 mischance. spurring eagerly he came up to him; but before he has time to
 say a word, cliges ran a fathom of his lance through the middle of his
 body, leaving him senseless on the ground. to the fourth he gives such a
 blow that he leaves him fainting on the field. after the fourth he goes at
 the fifth, and after him he attacks the sixth. none of them could defend
 himself, but each was left silent and mute. he stood in less fear of the
 others now, and more hardily pressed after them, taking no further thought
 of the six dead men.
 (vv. -.) feeling no further care for them, he starts to present a
 debt of shame and woe to the others who are leading the maid away. he
 caught up with them, and made such an onslaught upon them as a hungry and
 ravenous wolf makes when leaping upon its prey. now he feels his luck has
 come, when he can display his chivalry and bravery openly before her who
 is his very life. now may he die, if he does not rescue her! and she, too,
 is at death's door from anxiety for his sake, though she does not know
 that he is no near. lance in rest, cliges made an attack which pleased him
 well; for he struck first one saxon and then another, so that with a
 single rush he carried them both to earth, though it cost him his ashen
 lance. and they both fall in such distress, being wounded in the body,
 that they have no power to rise again and do him any harm or ill. the
 other four in bitter rage join in an attack upon cliges; but he neither
 quails nor trembles, and they are unable to dislodge him from his seat.
 quickly drawing his keen sword from its sheath, in order to please her who
 awaits his love, he rode hard at a saxon and, striking him with his
 whetted blade, he severed his head and half his neck from the body: such
 was the limit of his pity. fenice, who witnesses what transpires, does not
 know yet that this is cliges. she wishes that it were he, indeed, but
 because of the present danger she says to herself that she would not have
 him there. thus, doubly she shows the devotion of a sweetheart, fearing at
 once his death, and desiring that honour may be his. and cliges sword in
 hand attacks the other three, who face him bravely and puncture and split
 his shield. but they are unable to lay hands upon him, or to pierce the
 meshes of his hauberk. and whatever cliges reaches cannot stand against
 his blow, but must needs be split and torn apart; for he turns faster than
 a top driven and lashed by the whip. boldness and love, which holds him
 enthralled, make him eager for the fray. he pressed the saxons so hard
 that he left them all dead and defeated, some only wounded, and others
 dead—except one whom he let escape, disdaining to kill him when left
 alone at his mercy; besides, he wished him to tell the duke of the loss
 and injury he had sustained. but before this fellow left cliges, he begged
 him to tell him his name, which later he repeated to the duke, thus
 rousing his bitter ire.
 (vv. -.) now bad luck had fallen to the duke, who was in great
 distress and grief. and cliges takes back fenice, whose love torments and
 troubles him. if he does not confess to her now, love will long be his
 enemy, and hers too, if she holds her peace and speaks not the word which
 will bring him joy; for now each can tell the other privily the thoughts
 that lie within the heart. but they so fear to be refused that they dare
 not reveal their hearts. for his part, he fears lest she will not accept
 his love, whereas she, too, would have spoken out had she not feared to be
 rejected. in spite of this, the eyes of each reveal the hidden thought, if
 only they had heeded this evidence. they converse by glance of eye, but
 their tongues are so cowardly that they dare not speak in any wise of the
 love which possesses them. no wonder if she hesitates to begin, for a maid
 must be a simple and shrinking thing; but he—why does he wait and
 hold back who was so bold for her just now, but now in her presence is
 cowardly? god! whence comes this fear, that he should shrink from a lonely
 girl, feeble and timid, simple and mild? it is as if i should see the dog
 flee before the hare, and the fish chase the beaver, the lamb the wolf,
 and the dove the eagle. in the same fashion the labourer would forsake his
 pick with which he strives to earn a livelihood, and the falcon would flee
 from the duck, and the gerfalcon from the heron, and the pike from the
 minnow, and the stag would chase the lion, and everything would be
 reversed. now i feel within me the desire to give some reason why it
 should happen to true lovers that they lose their sense and boldness to
 say what they have in mind when they have leisure and place and time.
 (vv. -.) ye who are interested in the art of love, who do
 faithfully maintain the customs and usage of his court, who never failed
 to obey his law, whatever the result might be, tell me if there is
 anything that pleases because of love without causing us to tremble and
 grow pale. if any one oppose me in this, i can at once refute his
 argument; for whoever does not grow pale and tremble, whoever does not
 lose his senses and memory, is trying to filch and get by stealth what
 does not by right belong to him. the servant who does not fear his master
 ought not to remain in his employ nor do his service. he who does not
 esteem his lord does not fear him, and whoever does not esteem him does
 not hold him dear, but rather tries to deceive him and to steal from him
 what is his. the servant ought to tremble with fear when his master calls
 or summons him. and whoever commits himself to love owns him as his lord
 and master, and is bound to do him reverence and fear him much and honour
 him, if he wishes to be numbered in his court. love without alarm or fear
 is like a fire without flame or heat, day without sun, comb without honey,
 summer without flowers, winter without frost, sky without moon, and a book
 without letters. such is my argument in refutation, for where fear is
 absent love is not to be mentioned. whoever would love must needs feel
 fear, for otherwise he cannot be in love. but let him fear only her whom
 he loves, and for her sake be brave against all others. then if he stands
 in awe of his lady-love cliges is guilty of nothing wrong. even so, he
 would not have failed to speak straightway with her of love, whatever the
 outcome might have been, had it not been that she was his uncle's wife.
 this causes the festering of his wound, and it torments and pains him the
 more because he dares not utter what he fain would say.
 (vv. -.) thus they make their way back to their own people, and if
 they speak of anything it is nothing of much concern. each seated on a
 white horse, they rode rapidly toward the camp, which was plunged in great
 sorrow. the whole army is beside itself with grief, but they are
 altogether wrong in supposing cliges to be dead: hence their bitter and
 poignant grief. and for fenice, too, they are in dismay, thinking never to
 win her back again. thus, for her and him the whole army is in great
 distress. but soon upon their return the whole affair will change its
 aspect; for now they have reached the camp again, and have quickly changed
 the grief to joy. joy returns and sorrow flees. all the troops come
 together and sally forth to welcome them. the two emperors, upon hearing
 the report about cliges and the damsel, go to meet them with joyful
 hearts, and each can hardly wait to hear how cliges found and recovered
 the empress. cliges tells them, and, as they listen, they are amazed and
 are loud in their praises of his courage and devotion. but, for his part,
 the duke is furious, swearing and proclaiming his determination to fight
 cliges, if he dares, in single combat; and it shall be agreed that if
 cliges wins the battle the emperor shall proceed unchallenged, and freely
 take the maiden with him, and if he should kill or defeat cliges, who had
 done him such injury, then let there be no truce or stay to prevent each
 party from doing its best. this is what the duke desires, and by an
 interpreter of his, who knew both the greek and the german tongues, he
 announces to the two emperors his desire thus to arrange the battle.
 (vv. -.) the messenger delivered his message so well in both
 languages that all could understand it. the entire army was in an uproar,
 saying that may god forbid that cliges ever engage in the battle. both
 emperors are in a fright, but cliges throws himself at their feet and begs
 them not to grieve, but if ever he did them any favour, he prays them to
 grant him this battle as a guerdon and reward. and if the right to fight
 should be denied him, then he will never again serve for a single day his
 uncle's cause and honour. the emperor, who loved his nephew as he should,
 raised him by the hand and said: "fair nephew, i am deeply grieved to know
 you are so keen to fight; for after joy, sorrow is to be expected. 
 you have made me glad, i cannot deny it; but it is hard for me to yield
 the point and send you forth to this battle, when i see you still so
 young. and yet i know you to be so confident of yourself that i dare not
 ever refuse anything that you choose to ask of me. be assured that, merely
 to gratify you, it should be done; but if my request has any power, you
 would never assume this task." "my lord, there is no need of further
 speech," said cliges; "may god damn me, if i would take the whole world,
 and miss this battle! i do not know why i should seek from you any
 postponement or long delay." the emperor weeps with pity, while cliges
 sheds tears of joy when the permission to fight is granted him. many a
 tear was shed that day, and no respite or delay was asked. before the hour
 of prime, by the duke's own messenger the challenge to battle was sent
 back to him accepted as he had proposed.
 (vv. -.) the duke, who thinks and confidently trusts that cliges
 will be unable to stave off death and defeat at his hands, has himself
 quickly armed. cliges, who is anxious for the fight, feels no concern as
 to how he shall defend himself. he asks the emperor for his arms, and
 desires him to dub him a knight. so the emperor generously gives him his
 arms, and he takes them, his heart being keen for the battle which he
 anticipates with joy and eagerness. no time is lost in arming him. and
 when he was armed from head to foot, the emperor, all sorrowing, girds the
 sword upon his side. thus cliges completely armed mounts his white arab
 steed; from his neck he hangs by the straps an ivory shield, such as will
 never break or split; and upon it there was neither colour nor design. all
 his armour was white, and the steed, and the harness, too, was all whiter
 than any snow.
 (vv. -.) cliges and the duke, now being armed, summon each other
 to meet half way, and they stipulate that their men shall take their stand
 on either side, but without their swords and lances, under oath and pledge
 that not a man will be so rash, so long as the battle lasts, as to dare to
 move for any reason, any more than he would dare to pluck out his own eye.
 when this had been agreed upon, they came together, each yearning ardently
 for the glory he hopes to win and for the joy of victory. but before a
 single blow was dealt, the empress has herself borne thither, solicitous
 for cliges' fate. it seems to her that if he dies, she, too, must needs do
 so. no comfort can avail to keep her from joining him in death, for,
 without him, life has no joys for her. when all were gathered on the field—high
 and low, young and old—and the guards had taken their place, then
 both seized their lances and rushed together so savagely that they both
 broke their lances and fell to the ground, unable to keep their saddles.
 but not being wounded, they quickly get upon their feet and attack each
 other without delay. upon their resonant helmets they play such a tune
 with swords that it seems to those who are looking on that the helmets are
 on fire and send forth sparks. and when the swords rebound in air,
 gleaming sparks fly off from them as from a smoking piece of iron which
 the smith beats upon his anvil after, drawing it from the forge. both of
 the vassals are generous in dealing blows in great plenty, and each has
 the best of intentions to repay quickly what he borrows; neither one holds
 back from repaying promptly capital and interest, without accounting and
 without measure. but the duke is much chagrined with anger and
 discomfiture when he fails to defeat and slay cliges in the first assault.
 such a marvellously great and mighty blow he deals him that he falls at
 his feet upon his knee.
 (vv. -.) when this blow brought cliges down, the emperor was
 struck with fear, and would have been no more dismayed had he himself been
 beneath the shield. nor could fenice in her fear longer contain herself,
 whatever the effect might be, from crying: "god help him!" as loud as she
 could. but that was the only word she uttered, for straightway her voice
 failed her, and she fell forward upon her face, which was somewhat wounded
 by the fall. two high nobles raised her up and supported her upon her feet
 until she returned to consciousness. but in spite of her countenance, none
 who saw her guessed why she had swooned. not a man there blamed her, but
 rather praised her for her act, for each one supposes that she would have
 done the same thing for him, if he had been in cliges' place, but in all
 this they are quite astray. cliges heard, and well understood, the sound
 of fenice's cry. her voice restored his strength and courage, as he leaped
 up quickly, and came with fury, toward the duke, so charging and attacking
 him that the duke in turn was now dismayed. for now he found him more
 fierce for the fray, stronger and more agile and energetic than when at
 first they came together. and because he feared his onslaught, he cried:
 "young man, so help me god, i see thou art brave and very bold. if it were
 not for my nephew now, whom i shall never more forget, i would gladly make
 peace with thee, and leave thy quarrel without interfering in it more."
 (vv. -.) "duke," says cliges, "what is your pleasure now? must one
 not surrender his right when he is unable to recover it? when one of two
 evils must be faced, one should choose the lesser one. your nephew was not
 wise to become angrily embroiled with me. you may be sure that i shall
 treat you in like fashion, if i get the chance, unless you agree to my
 terms of peace." the duke, to whom it seems that cliges' vigour is
 steadily growing, thinks that he had better desist in mid-career before he
 is utterly undone. nevertheless, he does not openly give in, but says:
 "young man, i see thou art skilful and alert and not lacking in courage.
 but thou art yet too young; therefore i feel assured that if i defeat and
 kill thee i shall gain no praise or fame, and i should never like to
 confess in the hearing of a man of honour that i had fought with thee, for
 i should but do thee honour, and myself win shame. but if thou art aware
 of honour's worth, it will always be a glorious thing for thee to have
 withstood me for two rounds at arms. so now my heart and feeling bid me
 let thee have thy way, and no longer fight with thee." 
 "duke," says cliges, "that will not do. in the hearing of all you must
 repeat those words, for it shall never be said and noised abroad that you
 let me off and had mercy on me. in the hearing of all those who are
 gathered here, you must repeat your words, if you wish to be reconciled
 with me." so the duke repeats his words in the hearing of all. then they
 make peace and are reconciled. but however the matter be regarded cliges
 had all the honour and glory of it, and the greeks were greatly pleased.
 for their part, the saxons could not laugh, all of them having plainly
 seen that their lord was worn out and exhausted just now; but there is no
 doubt at all that, if he could have helped himself, this peace would never
 have been made, and that cliges' soul would have been drawn from his body
 had it proven possible. the duke goes back to saxony sorrowing, downcast,
 and filled with shame; for of his men there are not even two who do not
 regard him as worsted, defeated, and disgraced. the saxons with all their
 shame have now returned to saxony, while the greeks without delay make
 their way with joy and gladness toward constantinople, for cliges by his
 prowess has opened the way for them. the emperor of germany no longer
 follows and convoys them. taking leave of the greek troops and of his
 daughter and cliges, and finally of the emperor, he stayed behind in
 germany. and the emperor of the greeks goes off happily and in joyous
 mood. cliges, brave and courteous, calls to mind his sire's command. if
 his uncle, the emperor, will give him his permission, he will go and ask
 him for leave to return to britain and there converse with his
 great-uncle, the king; for he is desirous of seeing and knowing him. so he
 presents himself before the emperor, and requests that he consent to let
 him go to britain to see his uncle and his friends. gently he proffered
 his request. but his uncle refused, when he had listened to the request he
 made. "fair nephew," he said, "it is not my will that you should wish to
 leave me. i shall never give you without regret this permission to go
 away. for it is my pleasure and desire that you should be my companion and
 lord, with me, of all my empire."
 (vv. -.) now cliges hears something that does not suit him when
 his uncle refuses the prayer and request he made. "fair sire," said he, "i
 am not brave and wise enough, nor would it be seemly for me to join myself
 with you or any one else in the duty of governing this empire; i am too
 young and inexperienced. they put gold to the test when they wish to learn
 if it is fine. and so it is my wish, in brief, to try to prove myself,
 wherever i can find the test. in britain, if i am brave, i can apply
 myself to the whetstone and to the real true test, whereby my prowess
 shall be proved. in britain are the gentlemen whom honour and prowess
 distinguish. and he who wishes to win honour should associate himself with
 them, for honour is won and gained by him who associates with gentlemen.
 and so i ask you for leave to go, and you may be very sure that if you do
 not grant me the boon and send me thither i shall go without your leave."
 "fair nephew, i will give you leave, seeing you are so disposed that i
 cannot keep you back either by force or prayer of mine. now since prayer,
 prohibition, and force do not avail, may god give you the desire and
 inclination promptly to return. i wish you to take with you more than a
 bushel of gold and silver, and i will give for your pleasure such horses
 as you may choose." he had no sooner spoken than cliges bowed before him.
 all that the emperor, mentioned and promised him was straightway brought
 thither.
 (vv. -.) cliges took all the money and companions that he wished
 and needed. for his personal use he took four horses of different colours:
 one white, one sorrel, one fallow red, and one black. but i must have
 passed over something which it is not proper to omit. cliges goes to ask
 and obtain leave to depart from his sweetheart fenice; for he wishes to
 commend her to god's safe keeping. coming before her, he throws himself
 upon his knees, weeping so bitterly that the tears moisten his tunic and
 ermine, the while keeping his eyes upon the ground; for he dares not raise
 his eyes to her, as if he were guilty of some crime and misdeed toward
 her, for which he seems overcome with shame. and fenice, who timidly and
 fearfully looks at him, does not know the occasion of his coming, and
 speaks to him with difficulty. "rise, friend and fair sir! sit here beside
 me, and weep no more, and tell me what your pleasure is." "lady, what
 shall i say, and what leave unsaid? i come to ask your leave." "leave? to
 do what?" "lady, i must go off to britain." "then tell me what your
 business is, before i give you leave to go." "lady, my father, before he
 departed this life and died, begged me not to fail to go to britain as
 soon as i should be made a knight. i should not wish for any reason to
 disregard his command. i must not falter until i have accomplished the
 journey. it is a long road from here to greece, and if i should go
 thither, the journey would be too long from constantinople to britain. but
 it is right that i should ask leave from you to whom i altogether belong."
 many a covert sigh and sob marked the separation. but the eyes of none
 were keen enough, nor the ears of any sharp enough, to learn from what he
 saw and heard that there was any love between these two. cliges, in spite
 of the grief he felt, took his leave at the first opportunity. he is full
 of thought as he goes away, and so are the emperor and many others who
 stay behind. but more than all the others, fenice is pensive: she finds no
 bottom or bound to the reflections which occupy her, so abundantly are her
 cares multiplied. she was still oppressed with thought when she arrived in
 greece. there she was held in great honour as mistress and empress; but
 her heart and mind belong to cliges, wherever he goes, and she wishes her
 heart never to return to her, unless it is brought back to her by him who
 is perishing of the same disease with which he has smitten her. if he
 should get well, she would recover too, but he will never be its victim
 without her being so as well. her trouble appears in her pale and changed
 colour; for the fresh, clear, and radiant colour which nature had given
 her is now a stranger to her face. she often weeps and often sighs. little
 she cares for her empire and for the riches that are hers. she always
 cherishes in her remembrance the hour when cliges went away, and the leave
 he took of her, how he changed colour and grew pale, and how tearful his
 expression was, for he came to weep in her presence humbly and simply upon
 his knees, as if constrained to worship her. all this is sweet and
 pleasant for her to remember and think about. and afterward, as a little
 treat, she takes on her tongue instead of spice a sweet word which for all
 greece she would not wish him to have used contrary to the sense she had
 understood when he first had uttered it; for she lives upon no other
 dainty, and there is nothing else that pleases her. this word alone
 sustains and nourishes her, and assuages all her pain. she cares to eat
 and drink of no other dish or beverage, for when the two lovers came to
 part, cliges had said he was "altogether hers." this word is so sweet and
 tastes so good that from the tongue it stirs her heart, and she takes it
 into her mouth and heart to be all the more sure of it. under any other
 lock she would not dare to store this treasure. nowhere could it be lodged
 so well as in her own bosom. she will never leave it exposed at any price,
 being in such fear of robbers and thieves. but there is no ground for her
 anxiety, and she need have no fear of the birds of prey, for her treasure
 is not movable, but is rather like a house which cannot be destroyed by
 fire or flood, but will always stay fixed in a single place. but she feels
 no confidence in the matter, so she worries and strives to find and hold
 some ground on which to stand, interpreting the situation in divers ways.
 she both opposes and defends her position, and engages in the following
 argument: "with what intention should cliges say 'i am altogether yours'
 unless it was love that prompted him? what power can i have over him that
 he should esteem me so highly as to make me the mistress of his heart? is
 he not more fair than i, and of higher rank than i? i see in it naught but
 love, which could vouchsafe me such a boon. i, who cannot escape its
 power, will prove by my own case that unless he loved me he would never
 say that he was mine; unless love holds him in its toils, cliges could
 never say that he was mine any more than i could say that i was altogether
 his unless love had put me in his hands. for if he loves me not, at least
 he does not fear me. i hope that love which gives me to him will in return
 give him to me. but now i am sore dismayed because it is so trite a word,
 and i may simply be deceived, for many there be who in flattering terms
 will say even to a total stranger, 'i and all that i have are yours,' and
 they are more idle chatterers than the jays. so i do not know what to
 think, for it might well turn out that he said it just to flatter me. yet
 i saw his colour change, and i saw him weeping piteously. in my judgment,
 the tears and his face confused and pale were not produced by treachery,
 nor were they the fruits of trickery. those eyes from which i saw tears
 roll down were not guilty of falsehood. signs enough of love i saw, if i
 know anything about it. yes, in an evil hour i thought of love; woe is me
 that i ever learned it, for the experience has been bitter. has it indeed?
 yes, verily. i am dead when i cannot see him who has stolen my heart away
 by his cajoling flattery, because of which my heart leaves its dwelling,
 and will not abide with me, hating my home and establishment. in truth i
 have been ill treated by him who has my heart in his keeping. he who robs
 me and takes what is mine cannot love me, of that i am sure. but am i
 sure? why then did he weep? why? it was not in vain, for there was cause
 enough. i must not assume that i was the cause of it, for one is always
 loath to leave people whom one loves and knows. so it is not strange if he
 was sorry and grieved and if he wept when he left some one whom he knew.
 but he who gave him this advice to go and dwell in britain could not have
 smitten me more effectively. he is cut to the quick who loses his heart.
 he who deserves it, should be treated ill; but i have never deserved such
 treatment. alas, unhappy one, why has cliges killed me when i am innocent?
 but i am unjust to accuse him thus without cause. surely cliges would
 never have deserted me if his heart were like mine. i am sure his heart is
 not like mine. and if my heart is lodged in his it will never draw away,
 and his will never part from mine, for my heart follows him secretly: they
 have formed such a goodly company. but, after all, to tell the truth, they
 are very different and contrary. how are they different and contrary? why,
 his is the master and mine the slave; and the slave can have no will of
 his own, but only do his master's will and forsake all other affairs. but
 what reference has that to me? my heart and service are no concern to him.
 this arrangement distresses me, that one is master of us both. why is not
 my heart as independent as his? then their power would be equalised. my
 heart is now a prisoner, unable to move itself unless his moves as well.
 and whether his heart wanders or stays still, mine must needs prepare to
 follow him in his train. god! why are our bodies not so near one another
 that i could in some way bring back my heart! bring back? foolish one, if
 i should remove it from its joy i should be the death of it. let it stay
 there! i have no desire to dislodge it, but rather wish that it tarry with
 its lord until he feel some pity for it. for rather over there than here
 ought he to have mercy on his servant, because they are both in a foreign
 land. if my heart knows well the language of flattery, as is necessary for
 the courtier, it will be rich ere it comes back. whoever wishes to stand
 in the good graces of his lord and sit beside him on his right, to be in
 the fashion now-a-days, must remove the feather from his head, even when
 there is none there. but there is one bad feature of this practice: while
 he is smoothing down his master, who is filled with evil and villainy, he
 will never be so courteous as to tell him the truth; rather he makes him
 think and believe that no one could compare with him in prowess and in
 knowledge, and the master thinks that he is speaking the truth. that man
 does not know himself who takes another's word about qualities which he
 does not possess. for even if he is a wicked and insolent wretch, and as
 cowardly as a hare, mean, crazy, and misshapen, and a villain both in word
 and deed—yet some man will praise him to his face who behind his
 back will mock at him. but when in his hearing he speaks of him to some
 other, he praises him, while his lord pretends not to hear what they say
 between themselves; if, however, he thought that he would not be heard, he
 would say something his master would not like. and if his master is
 pleased to lie, the servant is all ready with his consent, and will never
 be backward in averring that all his master says is true. he who frequents
 courts and lords must ever be ready with a lie. so, too, must my heart do
 if it would find favour with its lord. let it flatter and be obsequious.
 but cliges is such a knight, so fair, so open, and so loyal, that my
 heart, in praising him, need never be false or perfidious, for in him
 there is nothing to be improved. therefore i wish my heart to serve him,
 for, as the people's proverb runs, 'he who serves a noble man is bad
 indeed if he does not improve in his company.'"
 (vv. -.) thus love harrows fenice. but this torment is her
 delight, of which she can never grow weary. and cliges now has crossed the
 sea and come to wallingford. there he took expensive quarters in great
 state. but his thoughts are always of fenice, not forgetting her for a
 single hour. while he delays and tarries there, his men, acting under his
 instructions, made diligent inquiries. they were informed that king
 arthur's barons and the king in person had appointed a tourney to be held
 in the plain before oxford, which lies close to wallingford. 
 there the struggle was arranged, and it was to last four days. but cliges
 will have abundant time to prepare himself if in the meantime he needs
 anything, for more than a fortnight must elapse before the tournament
 begins. he orders three of his squires to go quickly to london and there
 buy three different sets of arms, one black, another red, the third green,
 and that on the way back each shall be kept covered with new cloth, so
 that if any one should meet them on the road he may not know the colour of
 the arms they carry. the squires start at once and come to london, where
 they find available everything they need. having finished this errand,
 they return at once without losing any time. when the arms they had
 brought were shown to cliges he was well pleased with them. he ordered
 them to be set away and concealed, together with those which the emperor
 had given him by the danube, when he knighted him. i do not choose to tell
 you now why he had them stored away; but it will be explained to you when
 all the high barons of the land are mounted on their steeds and assemble
 in search of fame.
 (vv. -.) on the day which had been agreed upon, the nobles of
 renown came together. king arthur, with all his men whom he had selected
 from among the best, took up his position at oxford, while most of the
 knights ranged themselves near wallingford. do not expect me to delay the
 story and tell you that such and such kings and counts were there, and
 that this, that, and the other were of the number.  when
 the time came for the knights to gather, in accordance with the custom of
 those days, there came forth alone between two lines one of king arthur's
 most valiant knights to announce that the tourney should begin. but in
 this case no one dares to advance and confront him for the joust. there is
 none who does not hold back. and there are some who ask: "why do these
 knights of ours delay, without stepping forward from the ranks? some one
 will surely soon begin." and the others make reply: "don't you see, then,
 what an adversary yonder party has sent against us? any one who does not
 know should learn that he is a pillar,  able to
 stand beside the best three in the world." "who is he, then?" "why, don't
 you see? it is sagremor the wild." "is it he?" "it surely is." cliges
 listens and hears what they say, as he sits on his horse morel, clad in
 armour blacker than a mulberry: for all his armour was black. as he
 emerges from the ranks and spurs morel free of the crowd, there is not
 one, upon seeing him, but exclaims to his neighbour: "that fellow rides
 well lance in rest; he is a very, skilful knight and carries his arms
 right handily; his shield fits well about his neck. but he must be a fool
 to undertake of his own free will to joust with one of the most valiant
 knights to be found in all the land. who can he be? where was he born? who
 knows him here?" "not i." "nor i." "there is not a flake of snow on him;
 but all his armour is blacker far than the cloak of any monk or prior."
 while thus they talk, the two contestants give their horses rein without
 delay, for they are very eager and keen to come together in the fight.
 cliges strikes him so that he crushes the shield against his arm, and the
 arm against his body, whereupon sagremor falls full length. cliges goes
 unerringly and bids him declare himself his prisoner, which sagremor does
 at once. now the tourney is fairly begun, and adversaries meet in rivalry.
 cliges rushes about the field, seeking adversaries with whom to joust, but
 not a knight presents himself whom he does not cast down or take prisoner.
 he excels in glory, all the knights on either side, for wherever he goes
 to battle, there the fight is quickly ended. that man may be considered
 brave who holds his ground to joust with him, for it is more credit to
 dare face him than it is to defeat another knight. and if cliges leads him
 away prisoner, for this at least he gains renown that he dared to wait and
 fight with him. cliges wins the fame and glory of all the tournament. when
 evening came, he secretly repaired to his lodging-place in order that none
 might have any words with him. and lest any one should seek the house
 where the black arms are displayed, he puts them away in a room in order
 that no one may find them or see them, and he hangs up his green arms at
 the street-door, where they will be in evidence, and where passers-by will
 see them. and if any one asks and inquires where his lodging is, he cannot
 learn when he sees no sign of the black shield for which he seeks.
 (vv. -.) by this ruse cliges remains hidden in the town. and those
 who were his prisoners went from one end of the town to the other asking
 for the black knight, but none could give them any information. even king
 arthur himself has search made up and down for him; but there is only one
 answer: "we have not seen him since we left the lists, and do not know
 what became of him." more than twenty young men seek him, whom the king
 sent out; but cliges so successfully concealed himself that they cannot
 find a trace of him. king arthur is filled with astonishment when he is
 informed that no one of high or low degree can point out his
 lodging-place, any more than if he were in caesarea, toledo, or crete.
 "upon my word," he says, "i know not what they may say, but to me this
 seems a marvellous thing. perchance it was a phantom that appeared in our
 midst. many a knight has been unhorsed, and noble men have pledged faith
 to one whose house they cannot find, or even his country or locality; each
 of these men perforce must fail to keep his pledge." thus the king spoke
 his mind, but he might as well have held his peace.
 (vv. -.) that evening among all the barons there was much talk of
 the black knight, for indeed they spoke of nothing else. the next day they
 armed themselves again without summons and without request. lancelot of
 the lake, in whom there is no lack of courage, rides forth with lance
 upright to await a contestant in the first joust. here comes cliges tiding
 fast, greener than the grass of the field, and mounted on a fallow red
 steed, carrying its mane on the right-hand side. wherever cliges spurs the
 horse, there is no one, either with hair or without, who does not look at
 him amazed and exclaim to his neighbour on either side: "this knight is in
 all respects more graceful and skilful than the one who yesterday wore the
 black arms, just as a pine is more beautiful than a white beech, and the
 laurel than the elder-bush. as yet we know not who yesterday's victor was;
 but we shall know to-night who this man is." each one makes reply: "i
 don't know him, nor did i ever see him, that i am aware. but he is fairer
 than he who fought yesterday, and fairer than lancelot of the lake. if
 this man rode armed in a bag and lancelot in silver and gold, this man
 would still be fairer than he." thus they all take cliges' part. and the
 two champions drive their steeds together with all the force of spur.
 cliges gives him such a blow upon the golden shield with the lion
 portrayed thereon that he knocks him down from his saddle and stands over
 him to receive his surrender. for lancelot there was no help; so he
 admitted himself his prisoner. then the noise began afresh with the shock
 of breaking lances. those who are on cliges' side place all their
 confidence in him. for of those whom he challenges and strikes, there is
 none so strong but must fall from his horse to earth. that day cliges did
 so well, and unhorsed and took captive so many knights, that he gave
 double the satisfaction to his side, and won for himself twice the glory
 that he had gained on the preceding day. when evening came, he betook
 himself as fast as he could to his lodging-place, and quickly ordered out
 the vermilion shield and his other arms, while he ordered the arms which
 he had worn that day to be laid away: the host carefully put them aside.
 again that evening the knights whom he had captured sought for him, but
 without hearing any news of him. in their lodging-places, most of those
 who speak of him do so with praise and admiration. the next day the gay
 and doughty knights return to the contest. from the oxford side comes
 forth a vassal of great renown—his name was perceval of wales. as
 soon as cliges saw him start, and learned certainly who it was, when he
 had heard the name of perceval he was very anxious to contest with him. he
 issued straightway from the ranks upon a spanish sorrel steed, and
 completely clad in vermilion armour. then all gaze at him, wondering more
 than ever before, and saying that they had never seen so perfect a knight.
 and the contestants without delay spur forward until their mighty blows
 land upon their shields. the lances, though they were short and stout,
 bend until they look like hoops. in the sight of all who were looking on,
 cliges struck perceval so hard that he knocked him from his horse and made
 him surrender without a long struggle or much ado. when perceval had
 pledged his word then the joust began again, and the engagement became
 general. every knight whom cliges meets he forces to earth. he did not
 quit the lists that day even for a single hour, while all the others
 struck at him as at a tower—individually, of course, and not in
 groups of two or three, for such was not the custom then. upon his shield,
 as upon an anvil, the others strike and pound, splitting and hewing it to
 bits. but every one who strikes him there, he pays back by casting him
 from his stirrups and saddle; and no one, unless he wished to lie, could
 fail to say when the jousting ceased that the knight with the red shield
 had won all the glory on that day. and all the best and most courtly
 knights would fain have made his acquaintance. but their desire was not
 felt before he had departed secretly, seeing the sun already set; and he
 had his vermilion shield and all his other harness removed, and ordered
 his white arms to be brought out, in which he had first been dubbed a
 knight, while the other arms and the steeds were fastened outside by the
 door. those who notice this realise and exclaim that they have all been
 defeated and undone by one single man; for each day he has disguised
 himself with a different horse and set of armour, thus seeming to change
 his identity; for the first time now they noticed this. and my lord gawain
 proclaimed that he never saw such a champion, and therefore he wished to
 make his acquaintance and learn his name, announcing that on the morrow he
 himself will be the first at the rally of the knights. yet, withal, he
 makes no boast; on the other hand, he says that he fully expects the
 stranger knight will have all the advantage with the lance; but it may be
 that with the sword he will not be his superior (for with the sword gawain
 had no master). now it is gawain's desire to measure his strength on the
 morrow with this strange knight who changes every day his arms, as well as
 his horse and harness. his moultings will soon be numerous if he continues
 thus each day, as is his custom, to discard his old and assume new
 plumage. thus, when he thought of the sword and the lance respectively.
 gawain disparaged and esteemed highly the prowess of his foe. the next day
 he sees cliges come back whiter than the fleur-delis, his shield grasped
 tight by the inside straps and seated on his white arab steed, as he had
 planned the night before. gawain, brave and illustrious, seeks no repose
 on the battleground, but spurs and rides forward, endeavouring as best he
 may to win honour in the fray, if he can find an opponent. in a moment
 they will both be on the field. for cliges had no desire to hold back when
 he overheard the words of the men who said: "there goes gawain, who is no
 weakling either on foot or ahorse. he is a man whom no one will attack."
 when cliges hears these words, he rushes toward him in mid-field; they
 both advance and come together with a swifter leap than that of the stag
 who hears the sound of the dogs as they come baying after him. the lances
 are thrust at the shields, and the blows produce such havoc that the
 lances split, crack and break clear down to the butt-end, and the
 saddle-bows behind give away, and the girths and breast-straps snap. both
 come to earth at once and draw their naked swords, while the others gather
 round to watch the battle. then king arthur stepped forward to separate
 them and establish peace. but before the truce was sworn, the white
 hauberks were badly torn and rent apart, the shields were cracked and
 hewed to bits, and the helmets crushed.
 (vv. -.) the king viewed them with pleasure for a while, as did
 many others who said that they esteemed the white knight's deeds of arms
 no less than those of my lord gawain, and they were not ready yet to say
 which was the better and which the worse, nor which was likely to win, if
 they had been allowed to fight to a finish; but it did not please the king
 to let them do more than they had done. so he stepped forward to separate
 them, saying: "stop now! woe if another blow be struck! make peace now,
 and be good friends. fair nephew gawain, i make this request of you; for
 without resentment and hate it is not becoming for a gentleman to continue
 to fight and defy his foe. but if this knight would consent to come to my
 court and join our sport it would not be to his sorrow or hurt. nephew,
 make this request of him." "gladly, my lord." cliges has no desire to
 refuse, and gladly consents to go when the tourney is concluded. for now
 he has more than sufficiently carried out the injunction of his father.
 and the king says he has no desire that the tournament shall last too
 long, and that they can afford to stop at once. so the knights drew off,
 according to the wish and order of the king. now that he is to follow in
 the royal suite, cliges sends for all his armour. as soon as he can, he
 comes to court; but first, he completely changed his gear, and came
 dressed in the style of the french. as soon as he arrived at court, all
 ran to meet him without delay, making such joy and festival that never was
 there greater seen, and all those call him lord whom he had captured in
 the joust; but he would hear none of this, and said they might all go
 free, if they were quite sure and satisfied that it was he who had
 captured them. and there was not one who did not cry: "you were the man;
 we are sure of that! we value highly your acquaintance, and we ought to
 love and esteem you and call you our lord, for none of us can equal you.
 just as the sun outshines the little stars, so that their light cannot be
 seen in the sky when the sun's rays appear, so is our prowess extinguished
 and abased in the presence of yours, though ours too was once famous in
 the world." cliges knows not what to reply, for in his opinion they all
 praise him more than he deserves; it pleases him, but he feels ashamed,
 and the blood rises in his face, revealing to all his modesty. escorting
 him into the middle of the hall, they led him to the king, where all
 ceased their words of compliment and praise. the time for the meal had
 come, and those whose duty it was hastened to set the tables. the tables
 in the hall were quickly spread, then while some took the towels, and
 others held the basins, they offered water to all who came. when all had
 washed, they took their seats. and the king, taking cliges by the hand,
 made him sit down in front of him, for he wished to learn this very day,
 if possible, who he was. of the meal i need not further speak, for the
 courses were as well supplied as if beef were selling at a penny.
 (vv. -.) when all the courses had been served, the king no longer
 held his peace. "my friend," he says, "i wish to learn if it was from
 pride that you did not deign to come to court as soon as you arrived in
 this country, and why you kept aloof from people, and why you changed your
 arms; and tell me what your name is, too, and from what race you spring."
 cliges replies: "it shall not be hid." he told and related to the king
 everything he wished to know. and when the king had heard it all, he
 embraced him, and made much of him, while all joined in greeting him. and
 when my lord gawain learned the truth, he, more than the others, cordially
 welcomed him. thus, all unite in saluting him, saying that he is very fair
 and brave. the king loves and honours him above all his nephews. cliges
 tarries with the king until the summer comes around, in the meantime
 visiting all brittany, france, and normandy, where he did so many knightly
 deeds that he thoroughly proved his worth. but the love whose wound he
 bears gives him no peace or relief. the inclination of his heart keeps him
 fixed upon a single thought. to fenice his thought harks back, who from
 afar afflicts his heart. the desire takes him to go back; for he has been
 deprived too long of the sight of the most desired lady who was ever
 desired by any one. he will not prolong this privation, but prepares to
 return to greece, and sets out, after taking leave. the king and my lord
 gawain were grieved, i can well believe, when they could no longer detain
 him. but he is anxious to return to her whom he loves and so covets that
 the way seems long to him as he passes over land and sea: so ardently he
 longs for the sight of her who has stolen and filched iris heart away. but
 she makes him recompense in full; for she pays him, as it were rent, the
 coin of her own heart, which is no less dear to her. but he is by no means
 sure of that, having no contract or agreement to show; wherefore his
 anxiety is great. and she is in just as great distress, harried and
 tormented by love, taking no pleasure in aught she sees since that moment
 when she saw him last. the fact that she does not even know whether he be
 alive or not fills her heart with anguish. but cliges draws nearer day by
 day, being fortunate in having favourable winds, until he joyfully comes
 to port before constantinople. when the news reached the city, none need
 ask if the emperor was glad; but a hundred times greater was the empress's
 joy.
 (vv. -.) cliges, with his company, having landed at
 constantinople, has now returned to greece. the richest and most noble men
 all come to meet him at the port. and when the emperor encounters him, who
 before all others had gone to meet him with the empress by his side, he
 runs to embrace and greet him in the presence of them all. and when fenice
 welcomes him, each changes colour in the other's presence, and it is
 indeed a marvel, when they are so close together, how they keep from
 embracing each other and bestowing such kisses as love would have; but
 that would have been folly and madness. the people come together from all
 sides with the desire to see him, and conduct him through the city, some
 on foot and some on horseback, until they bring him to the imperial
 palace. no words can ever tell the joy and honour and courteous service
 that were there displayed. but each one strove as best he might to do
 everything which he thought would please and gratify cliges. and his uncle
 hands over to him all his possessions, except the crown: he wishes him to
 gratify his pleasure fully, and to take all he desires of his wealth,
 either in the form of land or treasure. but he has no care for silver or
 gold, so long as he dares not reveal his thoughts to her because of whom
 he can find no repose; and yet he has plenty of time and opportunity to
 speak, if he were not afraid of being repelled; for now he can see her
 every day, and sit beside her "tete-a-tete" without opposition or
 hindrance, for no one sees any harm in that.
 (vv. -.) some time after his return, he came alone one day to the
 room of her who was not his enemy, and you may be sure that the door was
 not barred at his approach. by her side he took his seat, while the others
 moved away, so that no one might be seated near them and hear their words.
 first, fenice spoke of britain, and asked him about the character and
 appearance of my lord gawain, until her words finally hit upon the subject
 which filled her with dread. she asked him if he had given his love to any
 dame or damsel in that land. cliges was not obstinate or slow to respond
 to this demand, but he knew at once what reply to make as soon as she had
 put the question. "lady," he says, "i was in love while there, but not
 with any one of that land. in britain my body was without my heart, as a
 piece of bark without the wood. since leaving germany i have not known
 what became of my heart, except that it came here after you. my heart was
 here, and my body was there. i was not really away from greece; for hither
 my heart had come, for which i now have come back again; yet, it does not
 return to its lodging-place, nor can i draw it back to me, nor do i wish
 to do so, if i could. and you—how has it fared with you, since you
 came to this country? what joy have you had here? do you like the people,
 do you like the land? i ought not to ask you any other question than
 whether the country pleases you." "it has not pleased me until now; but at
 present i feel a certain joy and satisfaction, which, you may be sure, i
 would not lose for pavia or piacenza. from this joy i cannot wrest my
 heart, nor shall i ever use force in the attempt. nothing but the bark is
 left in me, for i live and exist without a heart. i have never been in
 britain, and yet without me my heart has been engaged in business there i
 know not what." "lady, when was it that your heart was there? tell me when
 it went thither—the time and season—if it be a thing that you
 can fairly tell me or any one else. was it there while i was there?" "yes,
 but you were not aware of it. it was there as long as you were, and came
 away again with you." "god! i never saw it, nor knew it was there. god!
 why did i not know it? if i had been informed of this, surely, my lady, i
 would have borne it pleasant company." "you would have repaid me with the
 consolation which you really owed to me, for i should have been very
 gracious to your heart if it had been pleased to come where it might have
 known i was." "lady, surely it came to you." "to me? then it came to no
 strange place, for mine also went to you." "then, lady, according to what
 you say, our hearts are here with us now, for my heart is altogether in
 your hands." "you in turn have mine, my friend; so we are in perfect
 accord. and you may be sure, so help me god, that your uncle has never
 shared in me, for it was not my pleasure, and he could not. never has he
 yet known me as adam knew his wife. in error i am called a wife; but i am
 sure that whoever calls me wife does not know that i am still a maid. even
 your uncle is not aware of it, for, having drunk of the sleeping potion,
 he thinks he is awake when he is asleep, and he fancies he has his sport
 with me while i lie in his embrace. but his exclusion has been complete.
 my heart is yours, and my body too, and from me no one shall ever learn
 how to practise villainy. for when my heart went over to you it presented
 you with the body too, and it made a pledge that none other should ever
 share in it. love for you has wounded me so deep that i should never
 recover from it, any more than the sea can dry up. if i love you, and you
 love me, you shall never be called tristan, nor i iseut; 
 for then our love would not be honourable. but i make you this promise,
 that you shall never have other joy of me than that you now have, unless
 you can devise some means whereby i can be removed from your uncle and his
 society without his finding me again, or being able to blame either you or
 me, or having any ground for accusation. and to-morrow you shall tell me
 of the best plan you have devised, and i, too, will think of it.
 to-morrow, as soon as i arise, come and speak with me; then each of us
 will speak his mind, and we shall proceed to execute whatever seems best."
 (vv. -.) as soon as cliges heard her will be fully agreed with
 her, and said that would be the best thing to do. he leaves her happy, and
 goes off with a light heart himself. that night each one lies awake
 thinking over, with great delight, what the best plan will be. the next
 morning, as soon as they had arisen, they meet again to take counsel
 privately, as indeed they must. cliges speaks first and says what he had
 thought of in the night: "my lady," says he, "i think, and am of the
 opinion, that we could not do better than go to britain; i thought i might
 take you there; now do not refuse, for never was helen so joyfully
 received at troy when paris took her thither but that still greater joy
 would be felt over you and me in the land of the king, my uncle. and if
 this plan does not meet with your favour, tell me what you think, for i am
 ready, whatever may happen, to abide by your decision." and she replies:
 "this is my answer: i will never go off with you thus; for after we had
 gone away, every one would speak of us as they do of iseut the blond and
 of tristan. and everywhere all men and women would speak evil of our love.
 no one would believe, nor is it natural that they should do so, the truth
 of the matter. who would believe that i have thus, all to no purpose,
 evaded and escaped from your uncle still a maid? i should be regarded
 simply as wanton and dissolute, and you would be thought mad. it is well
 to remember and observe the injunction of st. paul: if any one is
 unwilling to live chaste, st. paul counsels him to act so that he shall
 receive no criticism, or blame, or reproach.  it is
 well to stop evil mouths, and therefore, if you agree, i have a proposal
 to make: it seems best to me to consent to feign that i am dead. i shall
 fall sick in a little while. and you in the meantime may plan some
 preparations for a place of burial. put all your wits to work to the end
 that a sepulchre and bier be so constructed that i shall not die in it, or
 be stifled, and that no one shall mount guard over it at night when you
 come to take me out. so now seek such a retreat for me, where no one may
 see me excepting you; and let no one provide for any need of mine except
 you, to whom i surrender and give myself. never, my whole life long, do i
 wish to be served by other man than you. my lord and my servant you shall
 be; whatever you do shall seem good to me; and never shall i be mistress
 of any empire unless you are its master. any wretched place, however dark
 and foul, will seem brighter to me than all these halls if you are with
 me. if i have you where i can see you, i shall be mistress of boundless
 treasure, and the world will belong to me. and if the business is
 carefully managed, no harm will come of it, and no one will ever be able
 to speak ill of it, for it will be believed throughout the empire that i
 am mouldering in the ground. my maid, thessala, who has been my nurse, and
 in whom i have great confidence, will give me faithful aid, for she is
 very clever, and i trust her fully." and cliges, when he heard his
 sweetheart, replies: "my lady, if this is feasible, and if you think your
 nurse's advice reliable, we have nothing to do but make our preparations
 without delay; but if we commit any imprudence, we are lost without
 escape. in this city there is an artisan who cuts and carves wonderful
 images: there is no land where he is not known for the figures which he
 has shapen and carved and made. john is his name, and he is a serf of
 mine. no one could cope with john's best efforts in any art, however
 varied it might be. for, compared with him, they are all novices, and like
 a child with nurse. by imitating his handiwork the artisans of antioch and
 rome have learned all they know how to do—and besides there is no
 more loyal man. now i want to make a test, and if i can put trust in him i
 will set him and all his descendants free; and i shall not fail to tell
 him of all our plan if he will swear and give his word to me that he will
 aid me loyally, and will never divulge my secret."
 (vv. -.) and she replies: "so let it be." with her permission
 cliges left the room and went away. and she sends for thessala, her maid,
 whom she brought with her from her native land. thessala came at once
 without delay, yet not knowing why she was summoned. when she asked fenice
 privately what was her desire and pleasure, she concealed none of her
 intentions from her. "nurse," she said, "i know full well that anything i
 tell you will go no further, for i have tried you thoroughly and have
 found you very prudent. i love you for all you have done for me. in all my
 troubles i appeal to you without seeking counsel elsewhere. you know why i
 lie awake, and what my thoughts and wishes are. my eyes behold only one
 object which pleases me, but i can have no pleasure or joy in it if i do
 not first buy it with a heavy price. for i have now found my peer; and if
 i love him he loves me in return, and if i grieve he grieves too for my
 pain and sorrow. now i must acquaint you with a plan and project upon
 which we two have privately agreed." then she told and explained to her
 how she was willing to feign illness, and would complain so bitterly that
 at last she would pretend to be dead, and how cliges would steal her away
 at night, and then they would be together all their days. she thinks that
 in no other way she could longer bear to live. but if she was sure that
 she would consent to lend her aid, the matter would be arranged in
 accordance with their wishes. "but i am tired of waiting for my joy and
 luck." then her nurse assured her that she would help her in every way,
 telling her to have no further fear. she said that as soon as she set to
 work she would bring it about that there would be no man, upon seeing her,
 who would not certainly believe that the soul had left the body after she
 had drunk of a potion which would leave her cold, colourless, pale, and
 stiff, without power of speech and deprived of health; yet she would be
 alive and well, and would have no sensations of any kind, and would be
 none the worse for a day and a night entire spent in the sepulchre and
 bier. 
 (vv. -.) when fenice heard these words, she thus spoke in reply:
 "nurse, i commit myself to you, and, with full confidence in you, will
 take no steps in my own behalf. i am in your hands; so think of my
 interests, and tell all the people who are here to betake themselves away,
 for i am ill, and they bother me." so, like a prudent woman, she said to
 them: "my lords, my lady is not well, and desires you all to go away. you
 are talking loud and making a noise, and the noise is disagreeable to her.
 she can get no rest or repose so long as you are in the room. i never
 remember her to have complained of such a sickness as this so violent and
 serious does it seem. so go away, and don't feel hurt." as soon as she had
 issued this command, they all quickly go away. and cliges sent for john to
 come quickly, and thus in private spoke to him: "john, dost thou know what
 i am about to say? thou art my slave and i thy master, and i can give away
 or sell thy body like a thing which is my own. but if i could trust thee
 in an affair i meditate, thou wouldst go for ever free, as well as the
 heirs which may be born of thee." john, in his desire for freedom, replies
 at once: "my lord, there is nothing i would not gladly do to see myself,
 my wife, and children free. tell me what your orders are, for nothing can
 be so hard as to cause me any work or pain or be hard for me to execute.
 for that matter, even were it against my will, i must needs obey your
 commands and give up my own affairs." "true, john; but this is a matter of
 which i hardly dare to speak, unless thou wilt assure me upon thy oath
 thou wilt faithfully give me aid and never betray me." "willingly, sire,"
 john makes reply: "have never a fear on that account! for i will swear and
 pledge my word that, so long as i live, i will never say a word which i
 think will grieve you or cause you harm." "ah john, even were i to die for
 it, there is no man to whom i would dare mention the matter in which i
 desire thy counsel; i would rather have my eye plucked out; i would rather
 be put to death by thee than that thou shouldst speak of it to another
 man. but i hold thee to be so loyal and prudent that i will reveal to thee
 all my thought. i am sure thou wilt observe my wishes, both by aiding me
 and holding thy peace." "truly, sire so, help me god!" then cliges speaks
 and explains to him openly the adventurous plan. and when he had revealed
 the project—as you have heard me set it forth—then john said
 that he would promise to construct the sepulchre in accordance with his
 best skill, and said that he would take him to see a certain house of his
 which no one yet had ever seen—not even his wife or any child of
 his. this house, which he had built, he would show him, if he cared to go
 with him to the place where in absolute privacy he works and paints and
 carves. he would show him the finest and prettiest place that he had ever
 seen. cliges replies: "let us go thither then."
 (vv. -.) below the city, in a remote spot, john had expended much
 labour in the construction of a tower. thither he conducted cliges,
 leading him through the different storeys, which were decorated with fine
 painted pictures. he shows him the rooms and the fire-places, taking him
 everywhere up and down. cliges examines this lonely house where no one
 lives or has access. he passes from one room to another, until he thinks
 he has seen it all, and he is much pleased with the tower and says he
 thinks it is very fine. the lady will be comfortable there as long as she
 lives, for no one will know of her dwelling place. "no sire, you are
 right; she will never be discovered here. but do you think you have seen
 all of my tower and fair retreat? there still remain rooms so concealed
 that no man could ever find them out. and if you choose to test the truth
 of this by investigating as thoroughly as you can, you can never be so
 shrewd and clever in your search as to find another story here, unless i
 show you and point it out. you must know that baths are not lacking here,
 nor anything else which a lady needs, and which i can think of or recall.
 the lady will be here at her ease. below the level of the ground the tower
 widens out, as you will see, and you cannot anywhere find any
 entrance-door. the door is made of hard stone with such skill and art that
 you cannot find the crack." cliges says: "these are wonderful things i
 hear. lead on and i will follow you, for i am anxious to see all this."
 then john started on, taking cliges by the hand, until he came to a smooth
 and polished door, all coloured and painted over. when john came to the
 wall, he stopped, holding cliges by the right hand. "sire," he says,
 "there is no one who could see a window or a door in this wall; and do you
 think that any one could pass through it without using violence and
 breaking it down?" and cliges replies that he does not think so, and that
 he will never think so, unless he sees it first. then john says that he
 shall see it at once, and that he will open a door in the wall for him.
 john, who constructed this piece of work, unfastens the door in the wall
 and opens it for him, so that he has to use no strength or violence to
 force it; then, one stepping before the other, they descend by a
 winding-stair to a vaulted apartment where john used to do his work, when
 it pleased him to labour at anything. "sire," he says, "of all the men god
 ever made, no one but us two has ever been where we are now. and you shall
 see presently how convenient the place is. my advice is that you choose
 this as your retreat, and that your sweetheart be lodged here. these
 quarters are good enough for such a guest; for there are bedrooms, and
 bathrooms with hot water in the tubs, which comes through pipes under the
 ground. whoever is looking for a comfortable place in which to establish
 and conceal his lady, would have to go a long way before he would find
 anything so charming. when you shall have explored it thoroughly you will
 find this place very suitable." then john showed him everything, fine
 chambers and painted vaults, pointing out many examples of his work which
 pleased cliges much. when they had examined the whole tower, cliges said:
 "john, my friend, i set you free and all your descendants, and my life is
 absolutely in your hands. i desire that my sweetheart be here all alone,
 and that no one shall know of it excepting me and you and her." john makes
 answer: "i thank you, sire. now we have been here long enough, and as we
 have nothing more to do, let us return." "that is right," says cliges,
 "let us be gone." then they go away, and leave the tower. upon their
 return they hear every one in the city saying to his neighbour: "don't you
 know the marvellous news about my lady, the empress? may the holy spirit
 give her health—the gentle and prudent lady; for she lies sick of a
 grievous malady."
 (vv. -.) when cliges heard this talk he went in haste to the
 court. but there was no joy or gladness there: for all the people were sad
 and prostrated because of the empress, who is only feigning to be ill; for
 the illness of which she complains causes her no grief or pain. but she
 has told them all that she wishes no one to enter her room so long as her
 sickness maintains its grip with its accompanying pains in her heart and
 head. she makes an exception, however, in favour of the emperor and his
 nephew, not wishing to place a ban upon them; but she will not care if the
 emperor, her lord, does not come. for cliges' sake she is compelled to
 pass through great pain and peril. it distresses her that he does not
 come, for she has no desire to see any one but him. cliges, however, will
 soon be there, to tell her of what he has seen and found. he came into the
 room and spoke to her, but stayed only a moment, for fenice, in order that
 they might think she was annoyed by what pleased her so, cried out aloud:
 "be gone, be gone! you disturb and bother me too much, for i am so
 seriously ill that i shall never rise up again." cliges, though pleased
 with this, goes away with a sad face: you would never see so woeful a
 countenance. to judge from his appearance he is very sad; but within his
 heart is gay in anticipation of its joy.
 (vv. -.) the empress, without being really ill, complains and
 pretends that she is sick. and the emperor, who has faith in her, ceases
 not to grieve, and summons a physician. but she will not allow any one to
 see her or touch her. the emperor may well feel chagrined when she says
 that she will never have but one doctor, who can easily restore her to
 health whenever it pleases him to do so. he can cause her to die or to
 live, and to him she trusts her health and life. they think that she
 refers to god; but her meaning is very different, for she is thinking of
 no one but cliges. he is her god who can bring her health, or who can
 cause her death.
 (vv. -.) thus the empress takes care that no physician shall
 examine her; and more completely to deceive the emperor she refuses to eat
 or drink, until she grows all pale and blue. meanwhile her nurse keeps
 busy about her, and with great shrewdness sought privily all through the
 city, without the knowledge of any one, until she found a woman who was
 hopelessly ill with a mortal disease. in order to perfect her ruse she
 used to go to see her often and promised to cure her of her illness; so
 each day she used to take a urinal in which to examine the urine, until
 she saw one day that no medicine could ever be of any help, and that she
 would die that very day. this urine thessala carried off and kept until
 the emperor arose, when she went to him and said: "if now it be your will,
 my lord, send for all your physicians; for my mistress has passed some
 water; she is very ill with this disease, and she desires the doctors to
 see it, but she does not wish them to come where she is." the doctors came
 into the hall and found upon examination that the urine was very bad and
 colourless, and each one said what he thought about it. finally, they all
 agreed that she would never recover, and that she would scarcely live till
 three o'clock, when, at the latest, god would take her soul to himself.
 this conclusion they reached privately, when the emperor asked and
 conjured them to tell him the truth. they reply that they have no
 confidence in her recovery, and that she cannot live past three o'clock
 but will yield up her soul before that time. when the emperor heard this,
 he almost fell unconscious to the floor, as well as many others who heard
 the news. never did any people make such moan as there was then throughout
 the palace. however, i will speak no further of their grief; but you shall
 hear of thessala's activities—how she mixes and brews the potion.
 she mixed and stirred it up, for she had provided herself a long time in
 advance with everything which she would need for the potion. a little
 before three o'clock she gives her the potion to drink. at once her sight
 became dimmed, her face grew as pale and white as if she had lost her
 blood: she could not have moved a foot or hand, if they had flayed her
 alive, and she does not stir or say a word, although she perceives and
 hears the emperor's grief and the cries which fill the hall. the weeping
 crowds lament through all the city, saying: "god! what woe and misfortune
 has been brought upon us by wicked death! o covetous and voracious death!
 death is worse than a she-wolf which always remains insatiable. such a
 cruel bite thou hast never inflicted upon the world! death, what hast thou
 done? may god confound thee for having put out the light of perfect
 beauty! thou hast done to death the fairest and most lovely creature, had
 she but lived, whom god has ever sought to form. god's patience surely is
 too great when he suffers thee to have the power to break in pieces what
 belongs to him. now god ought to be wroth with thee, and cast thee out of
 thy bailiwick; for thy impudence has been too great, as well as thy pride
 and disrespect." thus the people storm about and wring their arms and beat
 their hands; while the priests read their psalms, making prayers for the
 good lady, that god may have mercy on her soul.
 (vv. -.)  in the midst of the tears and
 cries, as the story runs, there arrived aged physicians from salerno,
 where they had long sojourned. at the sight of the great mourning they
 stopped to ask and inquire the cause of the cries and tears—why all
 the people are in such sorrow and distress. and this is the answer they
 receive: "god! gentlemen, don't you know? the whole world would be beside
 itself as we are, if it but knew of the great sorrow and grief and woe and
 loss which has come to us this day. god! where have you come from, then,
 that you do not know what has happened just now in this city? we will tell
 you the truth, for we wish you to join with us in the grief we feel. do
 you not know about grim death, who desires and covets all things, and
 everywhere lies in wait for what is best, do you not know what mad act she
 has committed to-day, as it is her wont to do? god has illuminated the
 world with one great radiance, with one bright light. but death cannot
 restrain herself from acting as her custom is. every day, to the extent of
 her power, she blots out the best creature she can find. so she wishes to
 try her power, and in one body she has carried off more excellence than
 she has left behind. she would have done better to take the whole world,
 and leave alive and sound this prey which now she has carried off. beauty,
 courtesy, and knowledge, and all that a lady can possess of goodness has
 been taken and filched from us by death, who has destroyed all goodness in
 the person of our lady, the empress. thus death has deprived us all of
 life." "ah, god!" the doctors say, "we know that thou art wroth with this
 city because we did not reach here sooner. if we had arrived here
 yesterday, death might have boasted of her strength if she could wrest her
 prey from us." "gentlemen, madame would not have allowed you at any price
 to see her or to exercise your skill. of good physicians there was no
 lack, but madame would not permit any one of them to see her or to
 investigate her malady." "no?" "truly, sirs, that she would not." then
 they recalled the case of solomon, who was so hated by his wife that she
 deceived him by feigning death.  they
 think this woman has done the same. but if they could in any way bring
 about her cure, no one could make them lie or keep them from exposing the
 truth, if they discovered any trickery. so to the court they take their
 way, where there was such a noise and cry that you could not have heard
 god's thunder crash. the chief of these three doctors, who knew the most,
 drew near the bier. no one says to him "keep hands off," and no one tries
 to hold him back. he places his hand on her breast and side, and surely
 feels that life is still in the body: he perceives and knows that well
 enough. he sees the emperor standing by, mad and tormented by his grief.
 seeing him, he calls aloud: "emperor, console thyself! i am sure and
 plainly see that this lady is not dead. leave off thy grief, and be
 comforted! if i do not restore her alive to thee, thou mayst kill me or
 string me up."
 (vv. -.) at once throughout the palace the noise is quieted and
 hushed. and the emperor bade the doctor tell him fully his orders and
 wishes, whatever they might be. if he can restore life in the empress he
 will be sire and lord over the emperor himself; but if he has in any
 respect lied to him he will be hanged like a common thief. and the doctor
 said: "i consent to that, and may you never have mercy upon me if i do not
 cause her to speak to you here! without tarrying and without delay have
 the palace cleared at once, and let not a single soul remain. i must
 examine in private the illness which afflicts the lady. these two doctors,
 who are my friends, will remain with me alone in the room, and let every
 one else go out." this order would have been opposed by cliges, john, and
 thessala; but all the others who were there might have turned against them
 if they had tried to oppose his order. so they hold their peace and
 approve what they hear approved by the others, and leave the palace. after
 the three doctors had forcibly tipped apart the lady's winding-sheer,
 without using any knife or scissors, they said to her: "lady, don't be
 frightened, have no fear, but speak to us with confidence! we know well
 enough that you are perfectly sound and in good state. be sensible and
 obliging now, and do not despair of anything, for if you have any need of
 us we will all three assure you of our aid, whether for good or ill. we
 shall be very loyal to you, both in keeping our counsel and in helping
 you. do not keep us talking here! since we put at your disposal our skill
 and service, you should surely not refuse." thus they think to hoodwink
 and deceive her, but they have no success; for she has no need or care for
 the service which they promise her; so they are wasting their time in a
 vain effort. when the three physicians see that they will make nothing out
 of her either by prayer or flattery, then they take her from her bier, and
 begin to beat and belabour her. but their efforts are foolish, for not a
 word can they extract from her. then they threaten and try to terrify her
 by saying that if she does not speak she will soon have reason to repent
 of her folly, for they are going to do such a wonderful thing to her that
 such a thing was never done to the body of any wretched woman. "we know
 that you are alive, and will not deign to speak to us. we know that you
 are feigning death, and would thus deceive the emperor. have no fear of
 us! if any of us has angered you, before we do you further harm, cease
 your mad behaviour now, for you are acting wickedly; and we will lend you
 our aid in any enterprise—wise or mad." but it cannot be; they have
 no success. then they renew their attack, striking her with thongs upon
 the back, so that the welts are plainly seen, and they combine to tear her
 tender flesh until they cause the blood to flow.
 (vv. -.) when they had beaten her with the thongs until they had
 slashed her flesh, and when the blood is dropping down, as it trickles
 from among the wounds, even then their efforts are of no avail to extract
 from her a sigh or word, nor to make her stir or move. then they say that
 they must procure fire and lead, which they will melt and lay upon her
 hands, rather than fail in their efforts to make her speak. after securing
 a light and some lead they kindle a fire and melt the lead. thus the
 miserable villains torment and afflict the lady, by taking the lead all
 boiling hot from the fire and pouring it into the palms of her hands. not
 satisfied with pouring the lead clean through her palms, the cowardly
 rascals say that, if she does not speak at once they will straightway
 stretch her on the grate until she is completely grilled. yet, she holds
 her peace, and does not refuse to have her body beaten and maltreated by
 them. now they were on the point of placing her upon the fire to be
 roasted and grilled when more than a thousand ladies, who were stationed
 before the palace, come to the door and through a little crack catch sight
 of the torture and anguish which they were inflicting upon the lady, as
 with coal and flame they accomplished her martyrdom. they bring clubs and
 hammers to smash and break down the door. great was the noise and uproar
 as they battered and broke in the door. if now they can lay hands on the
 doctors, the latter will not have long to wait before they receive their
 full deserts. with a single rush the ladies enter the palace, and in the
 press is thessala, who has no other aim than to reach her mistress. beside
 the fire she finds her stripped, severely wounded and injured. she puts
 her back in the bier again, and over her she spreads a cloth, while the
 ladies go to give their reward to the three doctors, without wishing to
 wait for the emperor or his seneschal. out of the windows they threw them
 down into the court-yard, breaking the necks, ribs, arms, and legs of all:
 no better piece of work was ever done by any ladies.
 (vv. -.) now the three doctors have received their gruesome reward
 at the hands of the ladies. but cliges is terror-stricken and filled with
 grief upon hearing of the pain and martyrdom which his sweetheart has
 endured for him. he is almost beside himself, fearing greatly, and with
 good reason, that she may be dead or badly injured by the torture
 inflicted upon her by the three physicians who now are dead. so he is in
 despair and despondency when thessala comes, bringing with her a very
 precious ointment with which she has already gently rubbed the body and
 wounds of her mistress. when they laid her back in her bier the ladies
 wrapped her again in a cloth of syrian stuff, leaving her face uncovered.
 all that night there is no abatement of the cries they raise unceasingly.
 throughout the city, high and low, poor and rich, are beside themselves
 with grief, and it seems as if each one boasts that he will outdo all
 others in his woe, and would fain never be comforted. all that night the
 grief continues. the next morning john came to the court; and the emperor
 sends for him and issues to him this command: "john, if ever thou
 wroughtest a fine piece of work, now put forth and show all thy skill in
 constructing such a sepulchre as for beauty and workmanship shall have no
 match." and john, who had already performed the task, says that he has
 already completed one which is very fine and cleverly wrought; but when he
 began the work he had no thought that other than a holy body should be
 laid in it. "now let the empress be laid in it and buried in some sacred
 place, for she, i think, is sanctified." "you have spoken well," says the
 emperor; "she shall be buried yonder in my lord saint peter's church,
 where bodies are wont to be interred. for before her death she made this
 request of me, that i should have her buried there. now go about your
 task, and place your sepulchre in the best position in the cemetery, where
 it ought rightfully to be." john replies: "very well, my lord." john at
 once takes his leave, and prepares the sepulchre with great skill; a
 feather-bed he placed inside, because the stone was hard and cold; and in
 order that the odour may be sweet, he spreads flowers and leaves about.
 another reason for doing this was that no one might perceive the mattress
 he had laid within the grave. already mass had been said for the dead in
 the churches and parishes, and the bells were tolling continuously as is
 proper for the dead. orders are given to bring the body to be laid in the
 sepulchre, which john with all his skill has constructed so richly and
 handsomely. in all constantinople none remains, whether small or great,
 who does not follow the body in tears, cursing and reproaching death.
 knights and youths alike grow faint, while the ladies and damsels beat
 their breasts as they thus find fault with death: "o death," cries each,
 "why didst thou not take ransom for my lady? surely, thy gain was slight
 enough, whereas the loss to us is great." and in this grief cliges surely
 bears his part, as he suffers and laments more than all the others do, and
 it is strange he does not kill himself. but still he decides to put this
 off until the hour and the time shall come for him to disinter her and get
 possession of her and see whether she be alive or not. over the gave stand
 the men who let down the body into its place; but, with john there, they
 do not meddle with the adjustment of the sarcophagus, and since they were
 so prostrated that they could not see, john had plenty of time to perform
 his special task. when the coffin was in its place, and nothing else was
 in the grave, he sealed up tightly all the joints. when this was done, any
 one would have been skilful who, except by force or violence, could take
 away or loosen anything which john had put inside.
 (vv. -.) fenice lies in the sepulchre until the darkness of night
 came on. but thirty knights mount guard over her, and there are ten tapers
 burning there, which light up the place all about. the knights were weary
 and exhausted by the strain they had undergone; so they ate and drank that
 night until they all fell sound asleep. when night came on, cliges steals
 away from the court and from all his followers, so that there was not a
 single knight or servant who knew what had become of him. he did not stop
 until he found john, who advises him as best he can. he furnishes him with
 arms, but he will never have any need of them. once armed, they both spur
 to the cemetery. the cemetery was enclosed all about with a high wall, so
 that the knights, who had gone asleep after making the gate fast within,
 could rest assured that no one would enter there. cliges does not see how
 he can get in, for there is no passing through the gate. and yet, somehow
 he must pass through, for love bids him and drives him on. he tries the
 wall and climbs up, being strong and agile. inside was a garden planted
 with trees, one of which stood so near the wall that it touched it. now
 cliges had what he needed, and after letting himself down by the tree, the
 first thing he did was to go to open the gate for john. seeing the knights
 asleep, they extinguished all the lights, so that the place remained in
 darkness. and john now uncovers the grave and opens the coffin, taking
 care to do it no harm. cliges steps into the grave and lifts out his
 sweetheart, all weak and prostrate, whom he fondles, kisses, and embraces.
 he does not know whether to rejoice or regret that she does not stir or
 move. and john, as quickly as he could, closed up the sepulchre again, so
 that it was not apparent that any one had tampered with it. then they
 betook themselves as fast as they could to the tower. when they had set
 her in the tower, in the rooms which were beneath the level of the ground,
 they took off her grave clothes; and cliges, who knew nothing of the
 potion which she had taken, which made her dumb and kept her motionless,
 thinks that she is dead, and is in despair with anxiety as he heavily
 sighs and weeps. but soon the time will come for the potion to lose its
 force. and fenice, who hears his grief, struggles and strives for strength
 to comfort him by word or glance. her heart almost bursts because of the
 sorrow which he shows. "ah death!" he says, "how mean thou art, to spare
 and reprieve all things despicable and vile—to let them live on and
 endure. death! art thou beside thyself or drunk, who hast killed my lady
 without me? this is a marvellous thing i see: my lady is dead, and i still
 live on! ah, precious one, why does your lover live to see you dead? one
 now could rightly say that you have died in my service, and that it is i
 who have killed and murdered you. sweetheart, then i am the death that has
 smitten you. is not that wrong? for it is my own life i have lost in you,
 and have preserved your life in me. for did not your health and life
 belong to me, sweet one? and did not mine belong to you? for i loved
 nothing excepting you, and our double existence was as one. so now i have
 done what was right in keeping your soul in my body while mine has escaped
 from your body, and one ought to go to seek the company of the other,
 wherever it may be, and nothing ought to separate them." at this she
 heaves a gentle sigh and whispers faintly: "lover mine, i am not
 altogether dead, but very near it. i value my life but little now. i
 thought it a jest and a mere pretence; but now i am indeed to be pitied,
 for death has not treated this as a jest. it will be a marvel if i escape
 alive. for the doctors have seriously wounded me, and broken my flesh and
 disfigured me. and yet, if it was possible for my nurse to come here, and
 if efforts were of any avail, she would restore me to health again." "do
 not worry, dear, about that," says cliges, "for this very night i will
 bring her here." "dear, let john go for her now." so john departed and
 looked for her until he found her, and told her how he wished her to come
 along and to let no other cause detain her; for fenice and cliges have
 sent for her to come to a tower where they are awaiting her; and that
 fenice is in a grievous state, so that she must come provided with
 ointments and remedies, and to bear in mind that she will not live long,
 if she does not quickly come to bear her aid. thessala runs at once and,
 taking ointments, plaster, and remedies which she has prepared, she meets
 john again. secretly they go out from the city, until they come straight
 to the tower. when fenice sees her nurse, she feels already cured, because
 of the loving faith and trust she places in her. and cliges greets her
 affectionately, and says: "welcome, nurse, whom i love and prize. nurse,
 for god's sake, what do you think of this young lady's malady? what is
 your opinion? will she recover?" "yes, my lord, have no fear but that i
 shall restore her completely. a fortnight will not pass before i make her
 so well that she was never before so lively and strong."
 (vv. -.) while thessala is busy with her remedies, john goes to
 provide the tower with everything that is necessary. cliges goes to the
 tower and comes away bravely and openly, for he has lodged a moulting
 falcon there, and he says that he goes to visit it; thus no one can guess
 that he goes there for any other reason than for the falcon. he makes long
 stays there night and day. he orders john to guard the tower, so that no
 one shall enter against his will. fenice now has no further cause to
 complain, for thessala has completely cured her. if cliges were duke of
 almeria, morocco, or tudela, he would not consider it all worth a
 holly-berry compared with the joy which he now feels. certainly love did
 not debase itself when it joined these two, for it seems to them, when
 they embrace and kiss each other, that all the world must be better for
 their joy and happiness. now ask me no more of this, for one can have no
 wish in which the other does not acquiesce. thus they have but one desire,
 as if they two themselves were one.
 (vv. -.) fenice was in the tower, i believe, all that year and
 full two months of the next, until summer came again. when the trees bring
 forth their flowers and leaves, and the little birds rejoice, singing
 gaily their litanies, it came about that fenice one morning heard the song
 of the nightingale. cliges was holding her tightly clasped with his arms
 about her waist and neck, and she held him in a like embrace, as she said:
 "dear fair lover mine. a garden would do me good, in which i could disport
 myself. for more than fifteen months i have not seen the light of moon or
 sun. if possible, i would fain go out yonder into the daylight, for here
 in this tower i am confined. if there was a garden near, where i could go
 and amuse myself, it would often do me good." then cliges promises her to
 consult with john about it as soon as he can see him. at that very moment
 john came in, as he was often wont to do, and cliges spoke to him of what
 fenice desired. john replies: "all that she asks for is already provided
 and supplied. this tower is well equipped with what she wishes and
 requires." then fenice was very glad, and asked john to take her there,
 which he said he would very gladly do. then john goes and opens a door,
 constructed in a fashion which i cannot properly describe. no one but john
 could have made it, and no one could have asserted that there was any door
 or window there—so perfectly was it concealed.
 (vv. -.) when fenice saw the door open, and the sun come streaming
 in, as she had not seen it for many a day, her heart beat high with joy;
 she said that now there was nothing lacking, since she could leave her
 dungeon-tower, and that she wished for no other lodging-place. she passed
 out through the door into the garden, with its pleasures and delights. in
 the middle of the garden stood a grafted tree loaded with blooming flowers
 and leaves, and with a wide-spreading top. the branches of it were so
 trained that they all hung downwards until they almost touched the ground;
 the main trunk, however, from which they sprang, rose straight into the
 air. fenice desires no other place. beneath the tree the turf is very
 pleasant and fine, and at noon, when it is hot, the sun will never be high
 enough for its rays to penetrate there. john had shown his skill in
 arranging and training the branches thus. there fenice goes to enjoy
 herself, where they set up a bed for her by day. there they taste of joy
 and delight. and the garden is enclosed about with a high wall connected
 with the tower, so that nothing can enter there without first passing
 through the tower.
 (vv. -.) fenice now is very happy: there is nothing to cause her
 displeasure, and nothing is lacking which she desires, when her lover is
 at liberty to embrace her beneath the blossoms and the leaves. 
 at the season when people take the sparrow-hawk and setter and hunt the
 lark and brown-thrush or stalk the quail and partridge, it chanced that a
 knight of thrace, who was young and alert and inclined to knightly sport,
 came one day close by the tower in his search for game. the hawk of
 bertrand (for such was his name) having missed a lark, had flown away, and
 bertrand thought how great his loss would be if he should lose his
 hunting-bird. when he saw it come down and light in a garden beneath the
 tower he was glad, for he thought he could not lose it now. at once he
 goes and clambers up the wall until he succeeds in getting over it, when
 beneath the tree he sees fenice and cliges lying asleep and naked in close
 embrace. "god!" said he, "what has happened to me now? what marvel is this
 i see? is that not cliges? it surely is. is not that the empress with him
 there? nay, but it looks like her. never did one thing so resemble
 another. her nose, her mouth, and brow are like those of my lady the
 empress. never did nature make two creatures of such similitude. there is
 no feature in this woman here which i have not seen in my lady. if she
 were alive, i should say that it was certainly she herself." just then a
 pear falls down and strikes close by fenice's ear. she jumps and awakes
 and, seeing bertrand, cries out aloud: "my dear, my dear, we are lost.
 yonder is bertrand. if he escapes you, we are caught in a bad trap, for he
 will tell that he has seen us." then bertrand realised that it was the
 empress beyond any doubt. he sees the necessity of leaving at once, for
 cliges had brought with him his sword into the garden, and had laid it
 down beside the bed. he jumped up now and grasped his sword, while
 bertrand hastily took his leave. as fast as he could he scaled the wall,
 and was almost safely over when cliges coming after him raised his sword
 and struck him with such violence that he severed his leg below the knee,
 as if it had been a fennel stalk. in spite of this, bertrand got away,
 though badly wounded and maimed. beside themselves with grief and wrath at
 the sight of his sorry state, his men on the other side picked him up, and
 insistently inquired who it was who had used him thus. "don't speak to me
 now," he says, "but help me to mount my horse. no mention shall be made of
 this excepting to the emperor. he who thus has treated me must be, and
 doubtless is, in great terror; for he is in great danger of his life."
 then they set him upon his palfrey and lead him through the city, sorely
 grieved in their fright the while. after them more than twenty thousand
 others come, following them to the court. and all the people run together,
 each striving to be there first. bertrand made his complaint aloud, in the
 hearing of all, to the emperor: but they took him for an idle chatterer
 when he said that he had seen the empress all exposed. the city is in a
 ferment of excitement: some regard the news they hear as simple nonsense,
 others advise and urge the emperor to visit the tower himself. great is
 the noise and confusion of the people who prepare to accompany him. but
 they find nothing in the tower, for fenice and cliges make their escape,
 taking with them thessala, who comforts them and declares to them that, if
 perchance they see people coming after them to arrest them, they need have
 no fear; that they would never approach to do them harm within the range
 of a strong cross-bow. and the emperor within the tower has john sought
 for and brought. he orders him to be bound and tied saying that he will
 have him hanged or burnt, and will have his ashes scattered wide. he shall
 receive his due reward for the shame he has caused the emperor; but this
 reward will not be agreeable, because john has hidden in the tower his
 nephew with his wife. "upon my word, you tell the truth," says john; "i
 will not lie, but will go still further and declare the truth, and if i
 have done any wrong it is right that i should be seized. but i offer this
 as my excuse: that a servant ought to refuse nothing when his lawful lord
 commands. now, every one knows forsooth that i am his, and this tower is
 too." "it is not, john. rather is it thine." "mine, sire? yes, after him:
 but neither do i belong to myself, nor have i anything which is mine,
 except what he pleased to bestow on me. and if you should think to say
 that my lord is guilty of having done you wrong, i am ready to take up his
 defence without any command from him. but i feel emboldened to proclaim
 openly what is on my mind, just as i have thought it out, for i know full
 well that i must die. so i will speak regardless of results. for if i die
 for my lord's sake, i shall not die an ignoble death, for the facts are
 generally known about that oath and pledge which you gave to your brother,
 that after you cliges should be emperor, who now is banished as a
 wanderer. but if god will, he shall yet be emperor! hence you are open to
 reproach, for you ought not to have taken a wife; yet you married her and
 did cliges a wrong, and he has done you no wrong at all. and if i am
 punished with death by you, and if i die wrongfully for his sake, and if
 he is still alive, he will avenge my death on you. now go and do the best
 you can, for if i die you shall also die."
 (vv. -.) the emperor trembles with wrath upon hearing the mocking
 words addressed to him by john. "john," he says, "thou shalt have so much
 respite, until we find thy lord, who has done such wrong to me, though i
 loved him dearly and had no thought of defrauding him. meanwhile, thou
 shalt stay in prison. if thou knowest what has become of him, tell me at
 once, i order thee." "i tell you? how can i commit such treachery? were
 the life to be drawn from my body i would not reveal my lord to you, even
 if i knew his whereabouts. as a matter of fact, i do not know any more
 than you where they have gone, so help me god! but there is no need for
 your jealousy. i do not so much fear your wrath that i should not say, so
 that all can hear, how you have been deceived, even my words are not
 believed. you were deceived and tricked by potion you drank on your
 wedding night. unless it happened in dream, when you were asleep, you have
 never had your pleasure with her; but the night made you dream, and the
 dream gave you as much satisfaction as if it had happened in your waking
 hours that she had held you in her arms: that was the sum of your
 satisfaction. her heart was so devoted to cliges that she feigned death
 for his sake; and he had such confidence in me that he explained it all to
 me and established her in my house, which rightfully belongs to him. you
 ought not to find fault with me. i ought, indeed, to be burnt or hanged,
 were i to betray my lord or refuse to do his will."
 (vv. -.) when the emperor's attention is recalled to the potion
 which he had been pleased to drink, and with which thessala had deceived
 him, then he realised for the first time that he had never had pleasure
 with his wife, unless it had happened in a dream: thus it was but an
 illusory joy. and he says that if he does not take vengeance for the shame
 and disgrace inflicted upon him by the traitor who has seduced his wife,
 he will never again be happy. "now quick!" he says, "as far as pavia, and
 from here to germany, let no castle, town, or city remain in which search
 is not made. i will hold that man above all others dear who will bring to
 me captive the two of them. now up and down, near and far, go diligently
 and search!" then they started out with zeal and spent all that day in the
 search. but in the number cliges had some friends, who, if they found
 them, would have led them to some hiding-place rather than hale them back
 again. all that fortnight they exhausted themselves in a fruitless search.
 for thessala, who is acting as their guide, conducts them by her arts and
 charms in such security that they feel no dread or fear of all the
 strength of the emperor. they seek repose in no town or city; yet they
 have all they wish or desire, even more so than is usually the case. for
 all they need is procured for them by thessala, who searches and scours
 and purveys for them. nor is there any who hunts them now, for all have
 returned to their homes again. meanwhile cliges is not idle, but starts to
 find his uncle, king arthur. he continued his search until he found him,
 and to him he made his claim and protest about his uncle, the emperor,
 who, in order to disinherit him, had disloyally taken a wife, which it was
 not right for him to do; for he had sworn to his father that he would
 never marry in his life. and the king says that with a fleet he will
 proceed to constantinople, and that he will fill a thousand ships with
 knights, and three thousand more with men-at-arms, until no city or burg,
 town or castle, however strong or however high, will be able to withstand
 their assault. then cliges did not forget to thank the king for the aid he
 offered him. the king sends out to seek and summon all the high barons of
 the land, and causes to be requisitioned and equipped ships, war vessels,
 boats, and barks. he has a hundred ships loaded and filled with shields,
 lances, bucklers, and armour fit for knights. the king makes such great
 preparations for the war that never did caesar or alexander make the like.
 he orders to assemble at his summons all england, and all flanders,
 normandy, france, and brittany, and all the men as far as the pyrenees. 
 already they were about to set sail, when messengers arrived from greece
 who delayed the embarkation and kept the king and his people back. among
 the messengers who came was john, that trusty man, for he would never be a
 witness or messenger of any news which was not true, and which he did not
 know for a certainty. the messengers were high born men of greece, who
 came in search for cliges. they made inquiry and asked for him, until they
 found him at the king's court, when they said to him: "god save you, sire!
 greece is made over to you, and constantinople is given to you by all
 those of your empire, because of the right you have to them. your uncle
 (but you know it not) is dead of the grief he felt because he could not
 discover you. his grief was such that he lost his mind; he would neither
 drink nor eat, but died like a man beside himself. fair sire, now come
 back again! for all your lords have sent for you. greatly they desire and
 long for you, wishing to make you their emperor." some there were that
 rejoiced at this; and others there were who would have gladly seen their
 guests elsewhere, and the fleet make sail for greece. but the expedition
 is given up, and the king dismisses his men, and the hosts depart to their
 homes again. and cliges hurriedly makes haste in his desire to return to
 greece. he has no wish to tarry. his preparations made, he took his leave
 of the king, and then of all his friends, and taking fenice with him, he
 goes away. they travel until they arrive in greece, where they receive him
 with the jubilation which they ought to show to their rightful lord, and
 they give him his sweetheart to be his wife. both of them are crowned at
 once. his mistress he has made his wife, but he still calls her his
 mistress and sweetheart, and she can complain of no loss of affection, for
 he loves her still as his mistress, and she loves him, too, as a lady
 ought to love her lover. and each day saw their love grow stronger: he
 never doubted her, nor did she blame him for anything. she was never kept
 confined, as so many women have been who have lived since her time. for
 never since has there been an emperor who did not stand in fear of his
 wife, lest he should be deceived by her, upon his hearing the story of how
 fenice deceived alis, first with the potion which he drank, and then later
 by that other ruse. therefore, every empress, however rich and noble she
 may be, is guarded in constantinople as in a prison, for the emperor has
 no confidence in her when he remembers the story of fenice. he keeps her
 constantly guarded in her room, nor is there ever allowed any man in her
 presence, unless he be a eunuch from his youth; in the case of such there
 is no fear or doubt that love will ensnare them in his bonds. here ends
 the work of chretien.

 or, the knight with the lion
 (vv. -.) arthur, the good king of britain, whose prowess teaches us
 that we, too, should be brave and courteous, held a rich and royal court
 upon that precious feast-day which is always known by the name of
 pentecost. 
 the court was at carduel in wales. when the meal was finished, the knights
 betook themselves whither they were summoned by the ladies, damsels, and
 maidens. some told stories; others spoke of love, of the trials and
 sorrows, as well as of the great blessings, which often fall to the
 members of its order, which was rich and flourishing in those days of old.
 but now its followers are few, having deserted it almost to a man, so that
 love is much abased. for lovers used to deserve to be considered
 courteous, brave, generous, and honourable. but now love is a
 laughing-stock, for those who have no intelligence of it assert that they
 love, and in that they lie. thus they utter a mockery and lie by boasting
 where they have no right.  but let us leave those who are
 still alive, to speak of those of former time. for, i take it, a courteous
 man, though dead, is worth more than a living knave. so it is my pleasure
 to relate a matter quite worthy of heed concerning the king whose fame was
 such that men still speak of him far and near; and i agree with the
 opinion of the bretons that his name will live on for evermore. and in
 connection with him we call to mind those goodly chosen knights who spent
 themselves for honour's sake. but upon this day of which i speak, great
 was their astonishment at seeing the king quit their presence; and there
 were some who felt chagrined, and who did not mince their words, never
 before having seen the king, on the occasion of such a feast, enter his
 own chamber either to sleep or to seek repose. but this day it came about
 that the queen detained him, and he remained so long at her side that he
 forgot himself and fell asleep. outside the chamber door were dodinel,
 sagremor, and kay, my lord gawain, my lord yvain, and with them
 calogrenant, a very comely knight, who had begun to tell them a tale,
 though it was not to his credit, but rather to his shame. the queen could
 hear him as he told his tale, and rising from beside the king, she came
 upon them so stealthily that before any caught sight of her, she had
 fallen, as it were, right in their midst. calogrenant alone jumped up
 quickly when he saw her come. then kay, who was very quarrelsome, mean,
 sarcastic, and abusive, said to him: "by the lord, calogrenant, i see you
 are very bold and forward now, and certainly it pleases me to see you the
 most courteous of us all. and i know that you are quite persuaded of your
 own excellence, for that is in keeping with your little sense. and of
 course it is natural that my lady should suppose that you surpass us all
 in courtesy and bravery. we failed to rise through sloth, forsooth, or
 because we did not care! upon my word, it is not so, my lord; but we did
 not see my lady until you had risen first." "really, kay," the queen then
 says, "i think you would burst if you could not pour out the poison of
 which you are so full. you are troublesome and mean thus to annoy your
 companions." "lady," says kay, "if we are not better for your company, at
 least let us not lose by it. i am not aware that i said anything for which
 i ought to be accused, and so i pray you say no more. it is impolite and
 foolish to keep up a vain dispute. this argument should go no further, nor
 should any one try to make more of it. but since there must be no more
 high words, command him to continue the tale he had begun." thereupon
 calogrenant prepares to reply in this fashion: "my lord, little do i care
 about the quarrel, which matters little and affects me not. if you have
 vented your scorn on me, i shall never be harmed by it. you have often
 spoken insultingly, my lord kay, to braver and better men than i, for you
 are given to this kind of thing. the manure-pile will always stink, 
 and gadflies sting, and bees will hum, and so a bore will torment and make
 a nuisance of himself. however, with my lady's leave, i'll not continue my
 tale to-day, and i beg her to say no more about it, and kindly not give me
 any unwelcome command." "lady," says kay, "all those who are here will be
 in your debt, for they are desirous to hear it out. don't do it as a
 favour to me! but by the faith you owe the king, your lord and mine,
 command him to continue, and you will do well." "calogrenant," the queen
 then says, "do not mind the attack of my lord kay the seneschal. he is so
 accustomed to evil speech that one cannot punish him for it. i command and
 request you not to be angered because of him, nor should you fail on his
 account to say something which it will please us all to hear; if you wish
 to preserve my good-will, pray begin the tale anew." "surely, lady, it is
 a very unwelcome command you lay upon me. rather than tell any more of my
 tale to-day, i would have one eye plucked out, if i did not fear your
 displeasure. yet will i perform your behest, however distasteful it may
 be. then since you will have it so, give heed. let your heart and ears be
 mine. for words, though heard, are lost unless understood within the
 heart. some men there are who give consent to what they hear but do not
 understand: these men have the hearing alone. for the moment the heart
 fails to understand, the word falls upon the ears simply as the wind that
 blows, without stopping to tarry there; rather it quickly passes on if the
 heart is not so awake as to be ready to receive it. for the heart alone
 can receive it when it comes along, and shut it up within. the ears are
 the path and channel by which the voice can reach the heart, while the
 heart receives within the bosom the voice which enters through the ear.
 now, whoever will heed my words, must surrender to me his heart and ears,
 for i am not going to speak of a dream, an idle tale, or lie, with which
 many another has regaled you, but rather shall i speak of what i saw."
 (vv. -.) "it happened seven years ago that, lonely as a countryman,
 i was making my way in search of adventures, fully armed as a knight
 should be, when i came upon a road leading off to the right into a thick
 forest. the road there was very bad, full of briars and thorns. in spite
 of the trouble and inconvenience, i followed the road and path. almost the
 entire day i went thus riding until i emerged from the forest of
 broceliande.  out from the forest i passed
 into the open country where i saw a wooden tower at the distance of half a
 welsh league: it may have been so far, but it was not anymore. proceeding
 faster than a walk, i drew near and saw the palisade and moat all round
 it, deep and wide, and standing upon the bridge, with a moulted falcon
 upon his wrist, i saw the master of the castle. i had no sooner saluted
 him than he came forward to hold my stirrup and invited me to dismount. i
 did so, for it was useless to deny that i was in need of a lodging-place.
 then he told me more than a hundred times at once that blessed was the
 road by which i had come thither. meanwhile, we crossed the bridge, and
 passing through the gate, found ourselves in the courtyard. in the middle
 of the courtyard of this vavasor, to whom may god repay such joy and
 honour as he bestowed upon me that night, there hung a gong not of iron or
 wood, i trow, but all of copper. upon this gong the vavasor struck three
 times with a hammer which hung on a post close by. those who were upstairs
 in the house, upon hearing his voice and the sound, came out into the yard
 below. some took my horse which the good vavasor was holding; and i saw
 coming toward me a very fair and gentle maid. on looking at her narrowly i
 saw she was tall and slim and straight. skilful she was in disarming me,
 which she did gently and with address; then, when she had robed me in a
 short mantle of scarlet stuff spotted with a peacock's plumes, all the
 others left us there, so that she and i remained alone. this pleased me
 well, for i needed naught else to look upon. then she took me to sit down
 in the prettiest little field, shut in by a wall all round about. there i
 found her so elegant, so fair of speech and so well informed, of such
 pleasing manners and character, that it was a delight to be there, and i
 could have wished never to be compelled to move. but as ill luck would
 have it, when night came on, and the time for supper had arrived. the
 vavasor came to look for me. no more delay was possible, so i complied
 with his request. of the supper i will only say that it was all after my
 heart, seeing that the damsel took her seat at the table just in front of
 me. after the supper the vavasor admitted to me that, though he had lodged
 many an errant knight, he knew not how long it had been since he had
 welcomed one in search of adventure. then, as a favour, he begged of me to
 return by way of his residence, if i could make it possible. so i said to
 him: 'right gladly, sire!' for a refusal would have been impolite, and
 that was the least i could do for such a host."
 (vv. -.) "that night, indeed, i was well lodged, and as soon as the
 morning light appeared, i found my steed ready saddled, as i had requested
 the night before; thus my request was carried out. my kind host and his
 dear daughter i commended to the holy spirit, and, after taking leave of
 all, i got away as soon as possible. i had not proceeded far from my
 stopping-place when i came to a clearing, where there were some wild bulls
 at large; they were fighting among themselves and making such a dreadful
 and horrible noise that if the truth be known, i drew back in fear, for
 there is no beast so fierce and dangerous as a bull. i saw sitting upon a
 stump, with a great club in his hand, a rustic lout, as black as a
 mulberry, indescribably big and hideous; indeed, so passing ugly was the
 creature that no word of mouth could do him justice. on drawing near to
 this fellow, i saw that his head was bigger than that of a horse or of any
 other beast; that his hair was in tufts, leaving his forehead bare for a
 width of more than two spans; that his ears were big and mossy, just like
 those of an elephant; his eyebrows were heavy and his face was flat; his
 eyes were those of an owl, and his nose was like a cat's; his jowls were
 split like a wolf, and his teeth were sharp and yellow like a wild boar's;
 his beard was black and his whiskers twisted; his chin merged into his
 chest and his backbone was long, but twisted and hunched. 
 there he stood, leaning upon his club and accoutred in a strange garb,
 consisting not of cotton or wool, but rather of the hides recently flayed
 from two bulls or two beeves: these he wore hanging from his neck. the
 fellow leaped up straightway when he saw me drawing near. i do not know
 whether he was going to strike me or what he intended to do, but i was
 prepared to stand him off, until i saw him stop and stand stock-still upon
 a tree trunk, where he stood full seventeen feet in height. then he gazed
 at me but spoke not a word, any more than a beast would have done. and i
 supposed that he had not his senses or was drunk. however, i made bold to
 say to him: 'come, let me know whether thou art a creature of good or
 not.' and he replied: 'i am a man.' 'what kind of a man art thou?' 'such
 as thou seest me to be: i am by no means otherwise.' 'what dost thou
 here?' 'i was here, tending these cattle in this wood.' 'wert thou really
 tending them? by saint peter of rome! they know not the command of any
 man. i guess one cannot possibly guard wild beasts in a plain or wood or
 anywhere else unless they are tied or confined inside.' 'well, i tend and
 have control of these beasts so that they will never leave this
 neighbourhood.' 'how dost thou do that? come, tell me now!' 'there is not
 one of them that dares to move when they see me coming. for when i can get
 hold of one i give its two horns such a wrench with my hard, strong hands
 that the others tremble with fear, and gather at once round about me as if
 to ask for mercy. no one could venture here but me, for if he should go
 among them he would be straightway done to death. in this way i am master
 of my beasts. and now thou must tell me in turn what kind of a man thou
 art, and what thou seekest here.' 'i am, as thou seest, a knight seeking
 for what i cannot find; long have i sought without success.' 'and what is
 this thou fain wouldst find?' 'some adventure whereby to test my prowess
 and my bravery. now i beg and urgently request thee to give me some
 counsel, if possible, concerning some adventure or marvellous thing.' says
 he: 'thou wilt have to do without, for i know nothing of adventure, nor
 did i ever hear tell of such. but if thou wouldst go to a certain spring
 here hard by and shouldst comply with the practice there, thou wouldst not
 easily come back again. close by here thou canst easily find a path which
 will lead thee thither. if thou wouldst go aright, follow the straight
 path, otherwise thou mayst easily go astray among the many other paths.
 thou shalt see the spring which boils, though the water is colder than
 marble. it is shadowed by the fairest tree that ever nature formed, for
 its foliage is evergreen, regardless of the winter's cold, and an iron
 basin is hanging there by a chain long enough to reach the spring. and
 beside the spring thou shalt find a massive stone, as thou shalt see, but
 whose nature i cannot explain, never having seen its like. on the other
 side a chapel stands, small, but very beautiful. if thou wilt take of the
 water in the basin and spill it upon the stone, thou shalt see such a
 storm come up that not a beast will remain within this wood; every doe,
 star, deer, boar, and bird will issue forth. for thou shalt see such
 lightning-bolts descend, such blowing of gales and crashing of trees, such
 torrents fail, such thunder and lightning, that, if thou canst escape from
 them without trouble and mischance, thou wilt be more fortunate than ever
 any knight was yet.' i left the fellow then, after he had pointed our the
 way. it must have been after nine o'clock and might have been drawing on
 toward noon, when i espied the tree and the chapel. i can truly say that
 this tree was the finest pine that ever grew on earth. i do not believe
 that it ever rained so hard that a drop of water could penetrate it, but
 would rather drip from the outer branches. from the tree i saw the basin
 hanging, 
 of the finest gold that was ever for sale in any fair. as for the spring,
 you may take my word that it was boiling like hot water. the stone was of
 emerald, with holes in it like a cask, and there were four rubies
 underneath, more radiant and red than is the morning sun when it rises in
 the east. now not one word will i say which is not true. i wished to see
 the marvellous appearing of the tempest and the storm; but therein i was
 not wise, for i would gladly have repented, if i could, when i had
 sprinkled the perforated stone with the water from the basin. but i fear i
 poured too much, for straightway i saw the heavens so break loose that
 from more than fourteen directions the lightning blinded my eyes, and all
 at once the clouds let fall snow and rain and hail. the storm was so
 fierce and terrible that a hundred times i thought i should be killed by
 the bolts which fell about me and by the trees which were rent apart. know
 that i was in great distress until the uproar was appeased. but god gave
 me such comfort that the storm did not continue long, and all the winds
 died down again. the winds dared not blow against god's will. and when i
 saw the air clear and serene i was filled with joy again. for i have
 observed that joy quickly causes trouble to be forgot. as soon as the
 storm was completely past, i saw so many birds gathered in the pine tree
 (if any one will believe my words) that not a branch or twig was to be
 seen which was not entirely covered with birds.  the tree
 was all the more lovely then, for all the birds sang in harmony, yet the
 note of each was different, so that i never heard one singing another's
 note. i, too, rejoiced in their joyousness, and listened to them until
 they had sung their service through, for i have never heard such happy
 song, nor do i think any one else will hear it, unless he goes to listen
 to what filled me with such joy and bliss that i was lost in rapture. i
 stayed there until i heard some knights coming, as i thought it seemed
 that there must be ten of them. but all the noise and commotion was made
 by the approach of a single knight. when i saw him coming on alone i
 quickly caught my steed and made no delay in mounting him. and the knight,
 as if with evil intent, came on swifter than an eagle, looking as fierce
 as a lion. from as far as his voice could reach he began to challenge me,
 and said: 'vassal, without provocation you have caused me shame and harm.
 if there was any quarrel between us you should first have challenged me,
 or at least sought justice before attacking me. but, sir vassal, if it be
 within my power, upon you shall fall the punishment for the damage which
 is evident. about me here lies the evidence of my woods destroyed. he who
 has suffered has the right to complain. and i have good reason to complain
 that you have driven me from my house with lightning-bolt and rain. you
 have made trouble for me, and cursed be he who thinks it fair. for within
 my own woods and town you have made such an attack upon me that resources
 of men of arms and of fortifications would have been of no avail to me; no
 man could have been secure, even if he had been in a fortress of solid
 stone and wood. but be assured that from this moment there shall be
 neither truce nor peace between us.' at these words we rushed together,
 each one holding his shield well gripped and covering himself with it. the
 knight had a good horse and a stout lance, and was doubtless a whole head
 taller than i. thus, i was altogether at a disadvantage, being shorter
 than he, while his horse was stronger than mine. you may be sure that i
 will tell the facts, in order to cover up my shame. with intent to do my
 best, i dealt him as hard a blow as i could give, striking the top of his
 shield, and i put all my strength into it with such effect that my lance
 flew all to splinters. his lance remained entire, being very heavy and
 bigger than any knight's lance i ever saw. and the knight struck me with
 it so heavily that he knocked me over my horse's crupper and laid me flat
 upon the ground, where he left me ashamed and exhausted, without bestowing
 another glance upon me. he took my horse, but me he left, and started back
 by the way he came. and i, who knew not what to do, remained there in pain
 and with troubled thoughts. seating myself beside the spring i rested
 there awhile, not daring to follow after the knight for fear of committing
 some rash act of madness. and, indeed, had i had the courage, i knew not
 what had become of him. finally, it occurred to me that i would keep my
 promise to my host and would return by way of his dwelling. this idea
 pleased me, and so i did. i laid off all my arms in order to proceed more
 easily, and thus with shame i retraced my steps. when i reached his home
 that night, i found my host to be the same good-natured and courteous man
 as i had before discovered him to be. i could not observe that either his
 daughter or he himself welcomed me any less gladly, or did me any less
 honour than they had done the night before. i am indebted to them for the
 great honour they all did me in that house; and they even said that, so
 far as they knew or had heard tell, no one had ever escaped, without being
 killed or kept a prisoner, from the place whence i returned. thus i went
 and thus i returned, feeling, as i did so, deeply ashamed. so i have
 foolishly told you the story which i never wished to tell again."
 (vv. -.) "by my head," cries my lord yvain, "you are my own
 cousin-german, and we ought to love each other well. but i must consider
 you as mad to have concealed this from me so long. if i call you mad, i
 beg you not to be incensed. for if i can, and if i obtain the leave, i
 shall go to avenge your shame." "it is evident that we have dined," says
 kay, with his ever-ready speech; "there are more words in a pot full of
 wine than in a whole barrel of beer.  they say
 that a cat is merry when full. after dinner no one stirs, but each one is
 ready to slay noradin,  and you will take vengeance on
 forre! are your saddle-cloths ready stuffed, and your iron greaves
 polished, and your banners unfurled? come now, in god's name, my lord
 yvain, is it to-night or to-morrow that you start? tell us, fair sire,
 when you will start for this rude test, for we would fain convoy you
 thither. there will be no provost or constable who will not gladly escort
 you. and however it may be, i beg that you will not go without taking
 leave of us; and if you have a bad dream to-night, by all means stay at
 home!" "the devil, sir kay," the queen replies, "are you beside yourself
 that your tongue always runs on so? cursed be your tongue which is so full
 of bitterness! surely your tongue must hate you, for it says the worst it
 knows to every man. damned be any tongue that never ceases to speak ill!
 as for your tongue, it babbles so that it makes you hated everywhere. it
 cannot do you greater treachery. see here: if it were mine, i would accuse
 it of treason. any man that cannot be cured by punishment ought to be tied
 like a madman in front of the chancel in the church." "really, madame,"
 says my lord yvain, "his impudence matters not to me. in every court my
 lord kay has so much ability, knowledge, and worth that he will never be
 deaf or dumb. he has the wit to reply wisely and courteously to all that
 is mean, and this he has always done. you well know if i lie in saying so.
 but i have no desire to dispute or to begin our foolishness again. for he
 who deals the first blow does not always win the fight, but rather he who
 gains revenge. he who fights with his companion had better fight against
 some stranger. i do not wish to be like the hound that stiffens up and
 growls when another dog yaps at him."
 (vv. -.) while they were talking thus, the king came out of his room
 where he had been all this time asleep. and when the knights saw him they
 all sprang to their feet before him, but he made them at once sit down
 again. he took his place beside the queen, who repeated to him word for
 word, with her customary skill, the story of calogrenant. the king
 listened eagerly to it, and then he swore three mighty oaths by the soul
 of his father utherpendragon, and by the soul of his son, and of his
 mother too, that he would go to see that spring before a fortnight should
 have passed; and he would see the storm and the marvels there by reaching
 it on the eve of my lord saint john the baptist's feast; there he would
 spend the night, and all who wished might accompany him. all the court
 thought well of this, for the knights and the young bachelors were very
 eager to make the expedition. but despite the general joy and satisfaction
 my lord yvain was much chagrined, for he intended to go there all alone;
 so he was grieved and much put out because of the king who planned to go.
 the chief cause of his displeasure was that he knew that my lord kay, to
 whom the favour would not be refused if he should solicit it, would secure
 the battle rather than he himself, or else perchance my lord gawain would
 first ask for it. if either one of these two should make request, the
 favour would never be refused him. but, having no desire for their
 company, he resolves not to wait for them, but to go off alone, if
 possible, whether it be to his gain or hurt. and whoever may stay behind,
 he intends to be on the third day in the forest of broceliande, and there
 to seek if possibly he may find the narrow wooded path for which he yearns
 eagerly, and the plain with the strong castle, and the pleasure and
 delight of the courteous damsel, who is so charming and fair, and with the
 damsel her worthy sire, who is so honourable and nobly born that he
 strives to dispense honour. then he will see the bulls in the clearing,
 with the giant boor who watches them. great is his desire to see this
 fellow, who is so stout and big and ugly and deformed, and as black as a
 smith. then, too, he will see, if possible, the stone and the spring
 itself, and the basin and the birds in the pine-tree, and he will make it
 rain and blow. but of all this he will not boast, nor, if he can help it,
 shall any one know of his purpose until he shall have received from it
 either great humiliation or great renown: then let the facts be known.
 (vv. -.) my lord yvain gets away from the court without any one
 meeting him, and proceeds alone to his lodging place. there he found all
 his household, and gave orders to have his horse saddled; then, calling
 one of his squires who was privy to his every thought, he says: "come now,
 follow me outside yonder, and bring me my arms. i shall go out at once
 through yonder gate upon my palfrey. for thy part, do not delay, for i
 have a long road to travel. have my steed well shod, and bring him quickly
 where i am; then shalt thou lead back my palfrey. but take good care, i
 adjure thee, if any one questions thee about me, to give him no
 satisfaction. otherwise, whatever thy confidence in me, thou need never
 again count on my goodwill." "sire," he says, "all will be well, for no
 one shall learn anything from me. proceed, and i shall follow you."
 (vv. -.) my lord yvain mounts at once, intending to avenge, if
 possible, his cousin's disgrace before he returns. the squire ran for the
 arms and steed; he mounted at once without delay, since he was already
 equipped with shoes and nails. then he followed his master's track until
 he saw him standing mounted, waiting to one side of the road in a place
 apart. he brought him his harness and equipment, and then accoutred him.
 my lord yvain made no delay after putting on his arms, but hastily made
 his way each day over the mountains and through the valleys, through the
 forests long and wide, through strange and wild country, passing through
 many gruesome spots, many a danger and many a strait, until he came
 directly to the path, which was full of brambles and dark enough; then he
 felt he was safe at last, and could not now lose his way. whoever may have
 to pay the cost, he will not stop until he sees the pine which shades the
 spring and stone, and the tempest of hail and rain and thunder and wind.
 that night, you may be sure, he had such lodging as he desired, for he
 found the vavasor to be even more polite and courteous than he had been
 told, and in the damsel he perceived a hundred times more sense and beauty
 than calogrenant had spoken of, for one cannot rehearse the sum of a
 lady's or a good man's qualities. the moment such a man devotes himself to
 virtue, his story cannot be summed up or told, for no tongue could
 estimate the honourable deeds of such a gentleman. my lord yvain was well
 content with the excellent lodging he had that night, and when he entered
 the clearing the next day, he met the bulls and the rustic boor who showed
 him the way to take. but more than a hundred times he crossed himself at
 sight of the monster before him—how nature had ever been able to
 form such a hideous, ugly creature. then to the spring he made his way,
 and found there all that he wished to see. without hesitation and without
 sitting down he poured the basin full of water upon the stone, when
 straightway it began to blow and rain, and such a storm was caused as had
 been foretold. and when god had appeased the storm, the birds came to
 perch upon the pine, and sang their joyous songs up above the perilous
 spring. but before their jubilee had ceased there came the knight, more
 blazing with wrath than a burning log, and making as much noise as if he
 were chasing a lusty stag. as soon as they espied each other they rushed
 together and displayed the mortal hate they bore. each one carried a
 stiff, stout lance, with which they dealt such mighty blows that they
 pierced the shields about their necks, and cut the meshes of their
 hauberks; their lances are splintered and sprung, while the fragments are
 cast high in air. then each attacks the other with his sword, and in the
 strife they cut the straps of the shields away, and cut the shields all to
 bits from end to end, so that the shreds hang down, no longer serving as
 covering or defence; for they have so split them up that they bring down
 the gleaming blades upon their sides, their arms, and hips. fierce,
 indeed, is their assault; yet they do not budge from their standing-place
 any more than would two blocks of stone. never were there two knights so
 intent upon each other's death. they are careful not to waste their blows,
 but lay them on as best they may; they strike and bend their helmets, and
 they send the meshes of their hauberks flying so, that they draw not a
 little blood, for the hauberks are so hot with their body's heat that they
 hardly serve as more protection than a coat. as they drive the sword-point
 at the face, it is marvellous that so fierce and bitter a strife should
 last so long. but both are possessed of such courage that one would not
 for aught retreat a foot before his adversary until he had wounded him to
 death. yet, in this respect they were very honourable in not trying or
 deigning to strike or harm their steeds in any way; but they sat astride
 their steeds without putting foot to earth, which made the fight more
 elegant. at last my lord yvain crushed the helmet of the knight, whom the
 blow stunned and made so faint that he swooned away, never having received
 such a cruel blow before. beneath his kerchief his head was split to the
 very brains, so that the meshes of his bright hauberk were stained with
 the brains and blood, all of which caused him such intense pain that his
 heart almost ceased to beat. he had good reason then to flee, for he felt
 that he had a mortal wound, and that further resistance would not avail.
 with this thought in mind he quickly made his escape toward his town,
 where the bridge was lowered and the gate quickly opened for him;
 meanwhile my lord yvain at once spurs after him at topmost speed. as a
 gerfalcon swoops upon a crane when he sees him rising from afar, and then
 draws so near to him that he is about to seize him, yet misses him, so
 flees the knight, with yvain pressing him so close that he can almost
 throw his arm about him, and yet cannot quite come up with him, though he
 is so close that he can hear him groan for the pain he feels. while the
 one exerts himself in flight the other strives in pursuit of him, fearing
 to have wasted his effort unless he takes him alive or dead; for he still
 recalls the mocking words which my lord kay had addressed to him. he had
 not yet carried out the pledge which he had given to his cousin; nor will
 they believe his word unless he returns with the evidence. the knight led
 him a rapid chase to the gate of his town, where they entered in; but
 finding no man or woman in the streets through which they passed, they
 both rode swiftly on till they came to the palace-gate.
 (vv. -.) the gate was very high and wide, yet it had such a narrow
 entrance-way that two men or two horses could scarcely enter abreast or
 pass without interference or great difficulty; for it was constructed just
 like a trap which is set for the rat on mischief bent, and which has a
 blade above ready to fall and strike and catch, and which is suddenly
 released whenever anything, however gently, comes in contact with the
 spring. in like fashion, beneath the gate there were two springs connected
 with a portcullis up above, edged with iron and very sharp. if anything
 stepped upon this contrivance the gate descended from above, and whoever
 below was struck by the gate was caught and mangled. precisely in the
 middle the passage lay as narrow as if it were a beaten track. straight
 through it exactly the knight rushed on, with my lord yvain madly
 following him apace, and so close to him that he held him by the
 saddle-bow behind. it was well for him that he was stretched forward, for
 had it not been for this piece of luck he would have been cut quite
 through; for his horse stepped upon the wooden spring which kept the
 portcullis in place. like a hellish devil the gate dropped down, catching
 the saddle and the horse's haunches, which it cut off clean. but, thank
 god, my lord yvain was only slightly touched when it grazed his back so
 closely that it cut both his spurs off even with his heels. and while he
 thus fell in dismay, the other with his mortal wound escaped him, as you
 now shall see. farther on there was another gate just like the one they
 had just passed; through this the knight made his escape, and the gate
 descended behind him. thus my lord yvain was caught, very much concerned
 and discomfited as he finds himself shut in this hallway, which was all
 studded with gilded nails, and whose walls were cunningly decorated with
 precious paints.  but about nothing was he so
 worried as not to know what had become of the knight. while he was in this
 narrow place, he heard open the door of a little adjoining room, and there
 came forth alone a fair and charming maiden who closed the door again
 after her. when she found my lord yvain, at first she was sore dismayed.
 "surely, sir knight," she says, "i fear you have come in an evil hour. if
 you are seen here, you will be all cut to pieces. for my lord is mortally
 wounded, and i know it is you who have been the death of him. my lady is
 in such a state of grief, and her people about her are crying so that they
 are ready to die with rage; and, moreover, they know you to be inside. but
 as yet their grief is such that they are unable to attend to you. the
 moment they come to attack you, they cannot fail to kill or capture you,
 as they may choose." and my lord yvain replies to her: "if god will they
 shall never kill me, nor shall i fall into their hands." "no," she says,
 "for i shall do my utmost to assist you. it is not manly to cherish fear.
 so i hold you to be a man of courage, when you are not dismayed. and rest
 assured that if i could i would help you and treat you honourably, as you
 in turn would do for me. once my lady sent me on an errand to the king's
 court, and i suppose i was not so experienced or courteous or so well
 behaved as a maiden ought to be; at any rate, there was not a knight there
 who deigned to say a word to me except you alone who stand here now; but
 you, in your kindness, honoured and aided me. for the honour you did me
 then i shall now reward you. i know full well what your name is, and i
 recognised you at once: your name is my lord yvain. you may be sure and
 certain that if you take my advice you will never be caught or treated
 ill. please take this little ring of mine, which you will return when i
 shall have delivered you."  then she handed him the little
 ring and told him that its effect was like that of the bark which covers
 the wood so that it cannot be seen; but it must be worn so that the stone
 is within the palm; then he who wears the ring upon his finger need have
 no concern for anything; for no one, however sharp his eyes may be, will
 be able to see him any more than the wood which is covered by the outside
 bark. all this is pleasing to my lord yvain. and when she had told him
 this, she led him to a seat upon a couch covered with a quilt so rich that
 the duke of austria had none such, and she told him that if he cared for
 something to eat she would fetch it for him; and he replied that he would
 gladly do so. running quickly into the chamber, she presently returned,
 bringing a roasted fowl and a cake, a cloth, a full pot of good grape-wine
 covered with a white drinking-cup; all this she offered to him to eat. and
 he, who stood in need of food, very gladly ate and drank.
 (vv. -.) by the time he had finished his meal the knights were
 astir inside looking for him and eager to avenge their lord, who was
 already stretched upon his bier. then the damsel said to yvain: "friend,
 do you hear them all seeking you? there is a great noise and uproar
 brewing. but whoever may come or go, do not stir for any noise of theirs,
 for they can never discover you if you do not move from this couch.
 presently you will see this room all full of ill-disposed and hostile
 people, who will think to find you here; and i make no doubt that they
 will bring the body here before interment, and they will begin to search
 for you under the seats and the beds. it will be amusing for a man who is
 not afraid when he sees people searching so fruitlessly, for they will all
 be so blind, so undone, and so misguided that they will be beside
 themselves with rage. i cannot tell you more just now, for i dare no
 longer tarry here. but i may thank god for giving me the chance and the
 opportunity to do some service to please you, as i yearned to do." then
 she turned away, and when she was gone all the crowd with one accord had
 come from both sides to the gates, armed with clubs and swords. there was
 a mighty crowd and press of hostile people surging about, when they espied
 in front of the gate the half of the horse which had been cut down. then
 they felt very sure that when the gates were opened they would find inside
 him whose life they wished to take. then they caused to be drawn up those
 gates which had been the death of many men. but since no spring or trap
 was laid for their passage they all came through abreast. then they found
 at the threshold the other half of the horse that had been killed; but
 none of them had sharp enough eyes to see my lord yvain, whom they would
 gladly have killed; and he saw them beside themselves with rage and fury,
 as they said: "how can this be? for there is no door or window here
 through which anything could escape, unless it be a bird, a squirrel, or
 marmot, or some other even smaller animal; for the windows are barred, and
 the gates were closed as soon as my lord passed through. the body is in
 here, dead or alive, since there is no sign of it outside there; we can
 see more than half of the saddle in here, but of him we see nothing,
 except the spurs which fell down severed from his feet. now let us cease
 this idle talk, and search in all these comers, for he is surely in here
 still, or else we are all enchanted, or the evil spirits have filched him
 away from us." thus they all, aflame with rage, sought him about the room,
 beating upon the walls, and beds, and seats. but the couch upon which he
 lay was spared and missed the blows, so that he was not struck or touched.
 but all about they thrashed enough, and raised an uproar in the room with
 their clubs, like a blind man who pounds as he goes about his search.
 while they were poking about under the beds and the stools, there entered
 one of the most beautiful ladies that any earthly creature ever saw. word
 or mention was never made of such a fair christian dame, and yet she was
 so crazed with grief that she was on the point of taking her life. all at
 once she cried out at the top of her voice, and then fell prostrate in a
 swoon. and when she had been picked up she began to claw herself and tear
 her hair, like a woman who had lost her mind. she tears her hair and rips
 her dress, and faints at every step she takes; nor can anything comfort
 her when she sees her husband borne along lifeless in the bier; for her
 happiness is at an end, and so she made her loud lament. the holy water
 and the cross and the tapers were borne in advance by the nuns from a
 convent; then came missals and censers and the priests, who pronounce the
 final absolution required for the wretched soul.
 (vv. -.) my lord yvain heard the cries and the grief that can
 never be described, for no one could describe it, nor was such ever set
 down in a book. the procession passed, but in the middle of the room a
 great crowd gathered about the bier, for the fresh warm blood trickled out
 again from the dead man's wound, and this betokened certainly that the man
 was still surely present who had fought the battle and had killed and
 defeated him. then they sought and searched everywhere, and turned and
 stirred up everything, until they were all in a sweat with the trouble and
 the press which had been caused by the sight of the trickling crimson
 blood. then my lord yvain was well struck and beaten where he lay, but not
 for that did he stir at all. and the people became more and more
 distraught because of the wounds which burst open, and they marvelled why
 they bled, without knowing whose fault it was.  and
 each one to his neighbour said: "the murderer is among us here, and yet we
 do not see him, which is passing strange and mysterious." at this the lady
 showed such grief that she made an attempt upon her life, and cried as if
 beside herself: "all god, then will the murderer not be found, the traitor
 who took my good lord's life? good? aye, the best of the good, indeed!
 true god, thine will be the fault if thou dost let him thus escape. no
 other man than thou should i blame for it who dost hide him from my sight.
 such a wonder was never seen, nor such injustice, as thou dost to me in
 not allowing me even to see the man who must be so close to me. when i
 cannot see him, i may well say that some demon or spirit has interposed
 himself between us, so that i am under a spell. or else he is a coward and
 is afraid of me: he must be a craven to stand in awe of me, and it is an
 act of cowardice not to show himself before me. ah, thou spirit, craven
 thing! why art thou so in fear of me, when before my lord thou weft so
 brave? o empty and elusive thing, why cannot i have thee in my power? why
 cannot i lay hands upon thee now? but how could it ever come about that
 thou didst kill my lord, unless it was done by treachery? surely my lord
 would never have met defeat at thy hands had he seen thee face to face.
 for neither god nor man ever knew of his like, nor is there any like him
 now. surely, hadst thou been a mortal man, thou wouldst never have dared
 to withstand my lord, for no one could compare with him." thus the lady
 struggles with herself, and thus she contends and exhausts herself. and
 her people with her, for their part, show the greatest possible grief as
 they carry off the body to burial. after their long efforts and search
 they are completely exhausted by the quest, and give it up from weariness,
 inasmuch as they can find no one who is in any way guilty. the nuns and
 priests, having already finished the service, had returned from the church
 and were gone to the burial. but to all this the damsel in her chamber
 paid no heed. her thoughts are with my lord yvain, and, coming quickly,
 she said to him: "fair sir, these people have been seeking you in force.
 they have raised a great tumult here, and have poked about in all the
 corners more diligently than a hunting-dog goes ferreting a partridge or a
 quail. doubtless you have been afraid." "upon my word, you are right,"
 says he: "i never thought to be so afraid. and yet, if it were possible i
 should gladly look out through some window or aperture at the procession
 and the corpse." yet he had no interest in either the corpse or the
 procession, for he would gladly have seen them all burned, even had it
 cost him a thousand marks. a thousand marks? three thousand, verily, upon
 my word. but he said it because of the lady of the town, of whom he wished
 to catch a glimpse. so the damsel placed him at a little window, and
 repaid him as well as she could for the honour which he had done her. from
 this window my lord yvain espies the fair lady, as she says: "sire, may
 god have mercy upon your soul! for never, i verily believe, did any knight
 ever sit in saddle who was your equal in any respect. no other knight, my
 fair sweet lord, ever possessed your honour or courtesy. generosity was
 your friend and boldness your companion. may your soul rest among the
 saints, my fair dear lord." then she strikes and tears whatever she can
 lay her hands upon. whatever the outcome may be, it is hard for my lord
 yvain to restrain himself from running forward to seize her hands. but the
 damsel begs and advises him, and even urgently commands him, though with
 courtesy and graciousness, not to commit any rash deed, saying: "you are
 well off here. do not stir for any cause until this grief shall be
 assuaged; let these people all depart, as they will do presently. if you
 act as i advise, in accordance with my views, great advantage may come to
 you. it will be best for you to remain seated here, and watch the people
 inside and out as they pass along the way without their seeing you. but
 take care not to speak violently, for i hold that man to be rather
 imprudent than brave who goes too far and loses his self-restraint and
 commits some deed of violence the moment he has the time and chance. so if
 you cherish some rash thought be careful not to utter it. the wise man
 conceals his imprudent thought and works out righteousness if he can. so
 wisely take good care not to risk your head, for which they would accept
 no ransom. be considerate of yourself and remember my advice. rest assured
 until i return, for i dare not stay longer now. i might stay so long, i
 fear, that they would suspect me when they did not see me in the crowd,
 and then i should suffer for it."
 (vv. -.) then she goes off, and he remains, not knowing how to
 comport himself. he is loath to see them bury the corpse without his
 securing anything to take back as evidence that he has defeated and killed
 him. if he has no proof or evidence he will be held in contempt, for kay
 is so mean and obstinate, so given to mockery, and so annoying, that he
 could never succeed in convincing him. he would go about for ever
 insulting him, flinging his mockery and taunts as he did the other day.
 these taunts are still fresh and rankling in his heart. but with her sugar
 and honey a new love now softened him; he had been to hunt upon his lands
 and had gathered in his prey. his enemy carries off his heart, and he
 loves the creature who hates him most. the lady, all unaware, has well
 avenged her lord's death. she has secured greater revenge than she could
 ever have done unless she had been aided by love, who attacks him so
 gently that he wounds his heart through his eyes. and this wound is more
 enduring than any inflicted by lance or sword. a sword-blow is cured and
 healed at once as soon as a doctor attends to it, but the wound of love is
 worst when it is nearest to its physician. this is the wound of my lord
 yvain, from which he will never more recover, for love has installed
 himself with him. he deserts and goes away from the places he was wont to
 frequent. he cares for no lodging or landlord save this one, and he is
 very wise in leaving a poor lodging-place in order to betake himself to
 him. in order to devote himself completely to him, he will have no other
 lodging-place, though often he is wont to seek out lowly hostelries. it is
 a shame that love should ever so basely conduct himself as to select the
 meanest lodging-place quite as readily as the best. but now he has come
 where he is welcome, and where he will be treated honourably, and where he
 will do well to stay. this is the way love ought to act, being such a
 noble creature that it is marvellous how he dares shamefully to descend to
 such low estate. he is like him who spreads his balm upon the ashes and
 dust, who mingles sugar with gall, and suet with honey. however, he did
 not act so this time, but rather lodged in a noble place, for which no one
 can reproach him. when the dead man had been buried, all the people
 dispersed, leaving no clerks or knights or ladies, excepting only her who
 makes no secret of her grief. she alone remains behind, often clutching at
 her throat, wringing her hands, and beating her palms, as she reads her
 psalms in her gilt lettered psalter. all this while my lord yvain is at
 the window gazing at her, and the more he looks at her the more he loves
 her and is enthralled by her. he would have wished that she should cease
 her weeping and reading, and that she should feel inclined to converse
 with him. love, who caught him at the window, filled him with this desire.
 but he despairs of realising his wish, for he cannot imagine or believe
 that his desire can be gratified. so he says: "i may consider myself a
 fool to wish for what i cannot have. her lord it was whom i wounded
 mortally, and yet do i think i can be reconciled with her? upon my word,
 such thoughts are folly, for at present she has good reason to hate me
 more bitterly than anything. i am right in saying 'at present', for a
 woman has more than one mind. that mind in which she is just now i trust
 she will soon change; indeed, she will change it certainly, and i am mad
 thus to despair. god grant that she change it soon! for i am doomed to be
 her slave, since such is the will of love. whoever does not welcome love
 gladly, when he comes to him, commits treason and a felony. i admit (and
 let whosoever will, heed what i say) that such an one deserves no
 happiness or joy. but if i lose, it will not be for such a reason; rather
 will i love my enemy. for i ought not to feel any hate for her unless i
 wish to betray love. i must love in accordance with love's desire. and
 ought she to regard me as a friend? yes, surely, since it is she whom i
 love. and i call her my enemy, for she hates me, though with good reason,
 for i killed the object of her love. so, then, am i her enemy? surely no,
 but her true friend, for i never so loved any one before. i grieve for her
 fair tresses, surpassing gold in their radiance; i feel the pangs of
 anguish and torment when i see her tear and cut them, nor can her tears
 e'er be dried which i see falling from her eyes; by all these things i am
 distressed. although they are full of ceaseless, ever-flowing tears, yet
 never were there such lovely eves. the sight of her weeping causes me
 agony, but nothing pains me so much as the sight of her face, which she
 lacerates without its having merited such treatment. i never saw such a
 face so perfectly formed, nor so fresh and delicately coloured. and then
 it has pierced my heart to see her clutch her throat. surely, it is all
 too true that she is doing the worst she can. and yet no crystal nor any
 mirror is so bright and smooth. god! why is she thus possessed, and why
 does she not spare herself? why does she wring her lovely hands and beat
 and tear her breast? would she not be marvellously fair to look upon when
 in happy mood, seeing that she is so fair in her displeasure? surely yes,
 i can take my oath on that. never before in a work of beauty was nature
 thus able to outdo herself, for i am sure she has gone beyond the limits
 of any previous attempt. how could it ever have happened then? whence came
 beauty so marvellous? god must have made her with his naked hand that
 nature might rest from further toil. if she should try to make a replica,
 she might spend her time in vain without succeeding in her task. even god
 himself, were he to try, could not succeed, i guess, in ever making such
 another, whatever effort he might put forth."
 (vv. -.) thus my lord yvain considers her who is broken with her
 grief, and i suppose it would never happen again that any man in prison,
 like my lord yvain in fear for his life, would ever be so madly in love as
 to make no request on his own behalf, when perhaps no one else will speak
 for him. he stayed at the window until he saw the lady go away, and both
 the portcullises were lowered again. another might have grieved at this,
 who would prefer a free escape to tarrying longer where he was. but to him
 it is quite indifferent whether they be shut or opened. if they were open
 he surely would not go away, no, even were the lady to give him leave and
 pardon him freely for the death of her lord. for he is detained by love
 and shame which rise up before him on either hand: he is ashamed to go
 away, for no one would believe in the success of his exploit; on the other
 hand, he has such a strong desire to see the lady at least, if he cannot
 obtain any other favour, that he feels little concern about his
 imprisonment. he would rather die than go away. and now the damsel
 returns, wishing to bear him company with her solace and gaiety, and to go
 and fetch for him whatever he may desire. but she found him pensive and
 quite worn out with the love which had laid hold of him; whereupon she
 addressed him thus: "my lord yvain, what sort of a time have you had
 to-day?" "i have been pleasantly occupied," was his reply. "pleasantly? in
 god's name, is that the truth? what? how can one enjoy himself seeing that
 he is hunted to death, unless he courts and wishes it?" "of a truth," he
 says, "my gentle friend, i should by no means wish to die; and yet, as god
 beholds me, i was pleased, am pleased now, and always shall be pleased by
 what i saw." "well, let us say no more of that," she makes reply, "for i
 can understand well enough what is the meaning of such words. i am not so
 foolish or inexperienced that i cannot understand such words as those; but
 come now after me, for i shall find some speedy means to release you from
 your confinement. i shall surely set you free to-night or to-morrow, if
 you please. come now, i will lead you away." and he thus makes reply: "you
 may be sure that i will never escape secretly and like a thief. when the
 people are all gathered out there in the streets, i can go forth more
 honourably than if i did so surreptitiously." then he followed her into
 the little room. the damsel, who was kind, secured and bestowed upon him
 all that he desired. and when the opportunity arose, she remembered what
 he had said to her how he had been pleased by what he saw when they were
 seeking him in the room with intent to kill him.
 (vv. -.) the damsel stood in such favour with her lady that she
 had no fear of telling her anything, regardless of the consequences, for
 she was her confidante and companion. then, why should she be backward in
 comforting her lady and in giving her advice which should redound to her
 honour? the first time she said to her privily: "my lady, i greatly marvel
 to see you act so extravagantly. do you think you can recover your lord by
 giving away thus to your grief?" "nay, rather, if i had my wish," says
 she, "i would now be dead of grief." "and why?" "in order to follow after
 him." "after him? god forbid, and give you again as good a lord, as is
 consistent with his might." "thou didst never speak such a lie as that,
 for he could never give me so good a lord again." "he will give you a
 better one, if you will accept him, and i can prove it." "begone! peace! i
 shall never find such a one." "indeed you shall, my lady, if you will
 consent. just tell me, if you will, who is going to defend your land when
 king arthur comes next week to the margin of the spring? you have already
 been apprised of this by letters sent you by the dameisele sauvage. alas,
 what a kind service she did for you! you ought to be considering how you
 will defend your spring, and yet you cease not to weep! if it please you,
 my dear lady, you ought not to delay. for surely, all the knights you have
 are not worth, as you well know, so much as a single chamber-maid. neither
 shield nor lance will ever be taken in hand by the best of them. you have
 plenty of craven servants, but there is not one of them brave enough to
 dare to mount a steed. and the king is coming with such a host that his
 victory will be inevitable." the lady, upon reflection, knows very well
 that she is giving her sincere advice, but she is unreasonable in one
 respect, as also are other women who are, almost without exception, guilty
 of their own folly, and refuse to accept what they really wish. "begone,"
 she says; "leave me alone. if i ever hear thee speak of this again it will
 go hard with thee, unless thou flee. thou weariest me with thy idle
 words." "very well, my lady," she says; "that you are a woman is evident,
 for woman will grow irate when she hears any one give her good advice."
 (vv. -.) then she went away and left her alone. and the lady
 reflected that she had been in the wrong. she would have been very glad to
 know how the damsel could ever prove that it would be possible to find a
 better knight than her lord had ever been. she would be very glad to hear
 her speak, but now she has forbidden her. with this desire in mind, she
 waited until she returned. but the warning was of no avail, for she began
 to say to her at once: "my lady, is it seemly that you should thus torment
 yourself with grief? for god's sake now control yourself, and for shame,
 at least, cease your lament. it is not fitting that so great a lady should
 keep up her grief so long. remember your honourable estate and your very
 gentle birth! think you that all virtue ceased with the death of your
 lord? there are in the world a hundred as good or better men." "may god
 confound me, if thou dost not lie! just name to me a single one who is
 reputed to be so excellent as my lord was all his life." "if i did so you
 would be angry with me, and would fly into a passion and you would esteem
 me less." "no, i will not, i assure thee." "then may it all be for your
 future welfare if you would but consent, and may god so incline your will!
 i see no reason for holding my peace, for no one hears or heeds what we
 say. doubtless you will think i am impudent, but i shall freely speak my
 mind. when two knights have met in an affray of arms and when one has
 beaten the other, which of the two do you think is the better? for my part
 i award the prize to the victor. now what do you think?" "it seems to me
 you are laying a trap for me and intend to catch me in my words." "upon my
 faith, you may rest assured that i am in the right, and i can irrefutably
 prove to you that he who defeated your lord is better than he was himself.
 he beat him and pursued him valiantly until he imprisoned him in his
 house." "now," she replies, "i hear the greatest nonsense that was ever
 uttered. begone, thou spirit charged with evil! begone, thou foolish and
 tiresome girl! never again utter such idle words, and never come again
 into my presence to speak a word on his behalf!" "indeed, my lady, i knew
 full well that i should receive no thanks from you, and i said so before i
 spoke. but you promised me you would not be displeased, and that you would
 not be angry with me for it. but you have failed to keep your promise, and
 now, as it has turned out, you have discharged your wrath on me, and i
 have lost by not holding my peace."
 (vv. -.) thereupon she goes back to the room where my lord yvain
 is waiting, comfortably guarded by her vigilance. but he is ill at ease
 when he cannot see the lady, and he pays no attention, and hears no word
 of the report which the damsel brings to him. the lady, too, is in great
 perplexity all night, being worried about how she should defend the
 spring; and she begins to repent of her action to the damsel, whom she had
 blamed and insulted and treated with contempt. she feels very sure and
 certain that not for any reward or bribe, nor for any affection which she
 may bear him, would the maiden ever have mentioned him; and that she must
 love her more than him, and that she would never give her advice which
 would bring her shame or embarrassment: the maid is too loyal a friend for
 that. thus, lo! the lady is completely changed: she fears now that she to
 whom she had spoken harshly will never love her again devotedly; and him
 whom she had repulsed, she now loyally and with good reason pardons,
 seeing that he had done her no wrong. so she argues as if he were in her
 presence there, and thus she begins her argument: "come," she says, "canst
 thou deny that my lord was killed by thee?" "that," says he, "i cannot
 deny. indeed, i fully admit it." "tell me, then, the reason of thy deed.
 didst thou do it to injure me, prompted by hatred or by spite?" "may death
 not spare me now, if i did it to injure you." "in that case, thou hast
 done me no wrong, nor art thou guilty of aught toward him. for he would
 have killed thee, if he could. so it seems to me that i have decided well
 and righteously." thus, by her own arguments she succeeds in discovering
 justice, reason, and common sense, how that there is no cause for hating
 him; thus she frames the matter to conform with her desire, and by her own
 efforts she kindles her love, as a bush which only smokes with the flame
 beneath, until some one blows it or stirs it up. if the damsel should come
 in now, she would win the quarrel for which she had been so reproached,
 and by which she had been so hurt. and next morning, in fact, she appeared
 again, taking the subject up where she had let it drop. meanwhile, the
 lady bowed her head, knowing she had done wrong in attacking her. but now
 she is anxious to make amends, and to inquire concerning the name,
 character, and lineage of the knight: so she wisely humbles herself, and
 says: "i wish to beg your pardon for the insulting words of pride which in
 my rage i spoke to you: i will follow your advice. so tell me now, if
 possible, about the knight of whom you have spoken so much to me: what
 sort of a man is he, and of what parentage? if he is suited to become my
 mate, and provided he be so disposed, i promise you to make him my husband
 and lord of my domain. but he will have to act in such a way that no one
 can reproach me by saying: 'this is she who took him who killed her
 lord.'" "in god's name, lady, so shall it be. you will have the gentlest,
 noblest, and fairest lord who ever belonged to abel's line." "what is his
 name?" "my lord yvain." "upon my word, if he is king urien's son he is of
 no mean birth, but very noble, as i well know." "indeed, my lady, you say
 the truth." "and when shall we be able to see him?" "in five days' time."
 "that would be too long; for i wish he were already come. let him come
 to-night, or to-morrow, at the latest." "my lady, i think no one could fly
 so far in one day. but i shall send one of my squires who can run fast,
 and who will reach king arthur's court at least by to-morrow night, i
 think; that is the place we must seek for him." "that is a very long time.
 the days are long. but tell him that to-morrow night he must be back here,
 and that he must make greater haste than usual. if he will only do his
 best, he can do two days' journey in one. moreover, to-night the moon will
 shine; so let him turn night into day. and when he returns i will give him
 whatever he wishes me to give." "leave all care of that to me; for you
 shall have him in your hands the day after to-morrow at the very latest.
 meanwhile you shall summon your men and confer with them about the
 approaching visit of the king. in order to make the customary defence of
 your spring it behoves you to consult with them. none of them will be so
 hardy as to dare to boast that he will present himself. in that case you
 will have a good excuse for saving that it behoves you to marry again. a
 certain knight, highly qualified, seeks your hand; but you do not presume
 to accept him without their unanimous consent. and i warrant what the
 outcome will be: i know them all to be such cowards that in order to put
 on some one else the burden which would be too heavy for them, they will
 fall at your feet and speak their gratitude; for thus their responsibility
 will be at an end. for, whoever is afraid of his own shadow willingly
 avoids, if possible, any meeting with lance or spear; for such games a
 coward has no use." "upon my word," the lady replies, "so i would have it,
 and so i consent, having already conceived the plan which you have
 expressed; so that is what we shall do. but why do you tarry here? go,
 without delay, and take measures to bring him here, while i shall summon
 my liege-men." thus concluded their conference. and the damsel pretends to
 send to search for my lord yvain in his country; while every day she has
 him bathed, and washed, and groomed. and besides this she prepares for him
 a robe of red scarlet stuff, brand new and lined with spotted fur. there
 is nothing necessary for his equipment which she does not lend to him: a
 golden buckle for his neck, ornamented with precious stones which make
 people look well, a girdle, and a wallet made of rich gold brocade. she
 fitted him out perfectly, then informed her lady that the messenger had
 returned, having done his errand well. "how is that?" she says, "is he
 here? then let him come at once, secretly and privily, while no one is
 here with me. see to it that no one else come in, for i should hate to see
 a fourth person here." at this the damsel went away, and returned to her
 guest again. however, her face did not reveal the joy that was in her
 heart; indeed, she said that her lady knew that she had been sheltering
 him, and was very much incensed at her. "further concealment is useless
 now. the news about you has been so divulged that my lady knows the whole
 story and is very angry with me, heaping me with blame and reproaches. but
 she has given me her word that i may take you into her presence without
 any harm or danger. i take it that you will have no objection to this,
 except for one condition (for i must not disguise the truth, or i should
 be unjust to you): she wishes to have you in her control, and she desires
 such complete possession of your body that even your heart shall not be at
 large." "certainly," he said, "i readily consent to what will be no
 hardship to me. i am willing to be her prisoner." "so shall you be: i
 swear it by this right hand laid upon you!. now come and, upon my advice,
 demean yourself so humbly in her presence that your imprisonment may not
 be grievous. otherwise feel no concern. i do not think that your restraint
 will be irksome." then the damsel leads him off, now alarming, now
 reassuring him, and speaking to him mysteriously about the confinement in
 which he is to find himself; for every lover is a prisoner. she is right
 in calling him a prisoner; for surely any one who loves is no longer free.
 (vv. -.) taking my lord yvain by the hand, the damsel leads him
 where he will be dearly loved; but expecting to be ill received, it is not
 strange if he is afraid. they found the lady seated upon a red cushion. i
 assure you my lord yvain was terrified upon entering the room, where he
 found the lady who spoke not a word to him. at this he was still more
 afraid, being overcome with fear at the thought that he had been betrayed.
 he stood there to one side so long that the damsel at last spoke up and
 said: "five hundred curses upon the head of him who takes into a fair
 lady's chamber a knight who will not draw near, and who has neither tongue
 nor mouth nor sense to introduce himself." thereupon, taking him by the
 arm, she thrust him forward with the words: "come, step forward, knight,
 and have no fear that my lady is going to snap at you; but seek her
 good-will and give her yours. i will join you in your prayer that she
 pardon you for the death of her lord, esclados the red." then my lord
 yvain clasped his hands, and failing upon his knees, spoke like a lover
 with these words: "i will not crave your pardon, lady, but rather thank
 you for any treatment you may inflict on me, knowing that no act of yours
 could ever be distasteful to me." "is that so, sir? and what if i think to
 kill you now?" "my lady, if it please you, you will never hear me speak
 otherwise." "i never heard of such a thing as this: that you put yourself
 voluntarily and absolutely within my power, without the coercion of any
 one." "my lady, there is no force so strong, in truth, as that which
 commands me to conform absolutely to your desire. i do not fear to carry
 out any order you may be pleased to give. and if i could atone for the
 death, which came through no fault of mine, i would do so cheerfully."
 "what?" says she, "come tell me now and be forgiven, if you did no wrong
 in killing my lord?" "lady," he says, "if i may say it, when your lord
 attacked me, why was i wrong to defend myself? when a man in self-defence
 kills another who is trying to kill or capture him, tell me if in any way
 he is to blame." "no, if one looks at it aright. and i suppose it would
 have been no use, if i had had you put to death. but i should be glad to
 learn whence you derive the force that bids you to consent unquestioningly
 to whatever my will may dictate. i pardon you all your misdeeds and
 crimes. but be seated, and tell us now what is the cause of your
 docility?" "my lady," he says, "the impelling force comes from my heart,
 which is inclined toward you. my heart has fixed me in this desire." "and
 what prompted your heart, my fair sweet friend?" "lady, my eyes." "and
 what the eyes?" "the great beauty that i see in you." "and where is
 beauty's fault in that?" "lady, in this: that it makes me love." "love?
 and whom?" "you, my lady dear." "i?" "yes, truly." "really? and how is
 that?" "to such an extent that my heart will not stir from you, nor is it
 elsewhere to be found; to such an extent that i cannot think of anything
 else, and i surrender myself altogether to you, whom i love more than i
 love myself, and for whom, if you will, i am equally ready to die or
 live." "and would you dare to undertake the defence of my spring for love
 of me?" "yes, my lady, against the world." "then you may know that our
 peace is made."
 (vv. -.) thus they are quickly reconciled. and the lady, having
 previously consulted her lords, says: "we shall proceed from here to the
 hall where my men are assembled, who, in view of the evident need, have
 advised and counselled me to take a husband at their request. and i shall
 do so, in view of the urgent need: here and now i give myself to you; for
 i should not refuse to accept as lord, such a good knight and a king's
 son."
 (vv. -.) now the damsel has brought about exactly what she had
 desired. and my lord yvain's mastery is more complete than could be told
 or described; for the lady leads him away to the hall, which was full of
 her knights and men-at-arms. and my lord yvain was so handsome that they
 all marvelled to look at him, and all, rising to their feet, salute and
 bow to my lord yvain, guessing well as they did so: "this is he whom my
 lady will select. cursed be he who opposes him! for he seems a wonderfully
 fine man. surely, the empress of rome would be well married with such a
 man. would now that he had given his word to her, and she to him, with
 clasped hand, and that the wedding might take place to-day or tomorrow."
 thus they spoke among themselves. at the end of the hall there was a seat,
 and there in the sight of all the lady took her place. and my lord yvain
 made as if he intended to seat himself at her feet; but she raised him up,
 and ordered the seneschal to speak aloud, so that his speech might be
 heard by all. then the seneschal began, being neither stubborn nor slow of
 speech: "my lords," he said, "we are confronted by war. every day the king
 is preparing with all the haste he can command to come to ravage our
 lands. before a fortnight shall have passed, all will have been laid
 waste, unless some valiant defender shall appear. when my lady married
 first, not quite seven years ago, she did it on your advice. now her
 husband is dead, and she is grieved. six feet of earth is all he has, who
 formerly owned all this land, and who was indeed its ornament. 
 it is a pity he lived so short a while. a woman cannot bear a shield, nor
 does she know how to fight with lance. it would exalt and dignify her
 again if she should marry some worthy lord. never was there greater need
 than now; do all of you recommend that she take a spouse, before the
 custom shall lapse which has been observed in this town for more than the
 past sixty years." at this, all at once proclaim that it seems to them the
 right thing to do, and they all throw themselves at her feet. they
 strengthen her desire by their consent; yet she hesitates to assert her
 wishes until, as if against her will, she finally speaks to the same
 intent as she would have done, indeed, if every one had opposed her wish:
 "my lords, since it is your wish, this knight who is seated beside me has
 wooed me and ardently sought my hand. he wishes to engage himself in the
 defence of my rights and in my service, for which i thank him heartily, as
 you do also. it is true i have never known him in person, but i have often
 heard his name. know that he is no less a man than the son of king urien.
 beside his illustrious lineage, he is so brave, courteous, and wise that
 no one has cause to disparage him. you have all already heard, i suppose,
 of my lord yvain, and it is he who seeks my hand. when the marriage is
 consummated, i shall have a more noble lord than i deserve." they all say:
 "if you are prudent, this very day shall not go by without the marriage
 being solemnised. for it is folly to postpone for a single hour an
 advantageous act." they beseech her so insistently that she consents to
 what she would have done in any case. for love bids her do that for which
 she asks counsel and advice; but there is more honour for him in being
 accepted with the approval of her men. to her their prayers are not
 unwelcome; rather do they stir and incite her heart to have its way. the
 horse, already under speed, goes faster yet when it is spurred. in the
 presence of all her lords, the lady gives herself to my lord yvain. from
 the hand of her chaplain he received the lady, laudine de landuc, daughter
 of duke laudunet, of whom they sing a lay. that very day without delay he
 married her, and the wedding was celebrated. there were plenty of mitres
 and croziers there, for the lady had summoned her bishops and abbots.
 great was the joy and rejoicing, there were many people, and much wealth
 was displayed—more than i could tell you of, were i to devote much
 thought to it. it is better to keep silent than to be inadequate. so my
 lord yvain is master now, and the dead man is quite forgot. he who killed
 him is now married to his wife, and they enjoy the marriage rights. the
 people love and esteem their living lord more than they ever did the dead.
 they served him well at his marriage-feast, until the eve before the day
 when the king came to visit the marvellous spring and its stone, bringing
 with him upon this expedition his companions and all those of his
 household; not one was left behind. and my lord kay remarked: "ah, what
 now has become of yvain, who after his dinner made the boast that he would
 avenge his cousin's shame? evidently he spoke in his cups. i believe that
 he has run away. he would not dare to come back for anything. he was very
 presumptuous to make such a boast. he is a bold man who dares to boast of
 what no one would praise him for, and who has no proof of his great feats
 except the words of some false flatterer. there is a great difference
 between a coward and a hero; for the coward seated beside the fire talks
 loudly about himself, holding all the rest as fools, and thinking that no
 one knows his real character. a hero would be distressed at hearing his
 prowess related by some one else. and yet i maintain that the coward is
 not wrong to praise and vaunt himself, for he will find no one else to lie
 for him. if he does not boast of his deeds, who will? all pass over him in
 silence, even the heralds, who proclaim the brave, but discard the
 cowards." when my lord kay had spoken thus, my lord gawain made this
 reply: "my lord kay, have some mercy now! since my lord yvain is not here,
 you do not know what business occupies him. indeed, he never so debased
 himself as to speak any ill of you compared with the gracious things he
 has said." "sire," says kay, "i'll hold my peace. i'll not say another
 word to-day, since i see you are offended by my speech." then the king, in
 order to see the rain, poured a whole basin full of water upon the stone
 beneath the pine, and at once the rain began to pour. it was not long
 before my lord yvain without delay entered the forest fully armed, tiding
 faster than a gallop on a large, sleek steed, strong, intrepid, and fleet
 of foot. and it was my lord kay's desire to request the first encounter.
 for, whatever the outcome might be, he always wished to begin the fight
 and joust the first, or else he would be much incensed. before all the
 rest, he requested the king to allow him to do battle first. the king
 says: "kay, since it is your wish, and since you are the first to make the
 request, the favour ought not to be denied." kay thanks him first, then
 mounts his steed. if now my lord yvain can inflict a mild disgrace upon
 him, he will be very glad to do so; for he recognises him by his arms. 
 each grasping his shield by the straps, they rush together. spurring their
 steeds, they lower the lances, which they hold tightly gripped. then they
 thrust them forward a little, so that they grasped them by the
 leather-wrapped handles, and so that when they came together they were
 able to deal such cruel blows that both lances broke in splinters clear to
 the handle of the shaft. my lord yvain gave him such a mighty blow that
 kay took a summersault from out of his saddle and struck with his helmet
 on the ground. my lord yvain has no desire to inflict upon him further
 harm, but simply dismounts and takes his horse. this pleased them all, and
 many said: "ah, ah, see how you prostrate lie, who but now held others up
 to scorn! and yet it is only right to pardon you this time; for it never
 happened to you before." thereupon my lord yvain approached the king,
 leading the horse in his hand by the bridle, and wishing to make it over
 to him. "sire," says he, "now take this steed, for i should do wrong to
 keep back anything of yours." "and who are you?" the king replies; "i
 should never know you, unless i heard your name, or saw you without your
 arms." then my lord told him who he was, and kay was overcome with shame,
 mortified, humbled, and discomfited, for having said that he had run away.
 but the others were greatly pleased, and made much of the honour he had
 won. even the king was greatly gratified, and my lord gawain a hundred
 times more than any one else. for he loved his company more than that of
 any other knight he knew. and the king requested him urgently to tell him,
 if it be his will, how he had fared; for he was very curious to learn all
 about his adventure; so the king begs him to tell the truth. and he soon
 told him all about the service and kindness of the damsel, not passing
 over a single word, not forgetting to mention anything. and after this he
 invited the king and all his knights to come to lodge with him, saying
 they would be doing him great honour in accepting his hospitality. and the
 king said that for an entire week he would gladly do him the honour and
 pleasure, and would bear him company. and when my lord yvain had thanked
 him, they tarry no longer there, but mount and take the most direct road
 to the town. my lord yvain sends in advance of the company a squire
 beating a crane-falcon, in order that they might not take the lady by
 surprise, and that her people might decorate the streets against the
 arrival of the king. when the lady heard the news of the king's visit she
 was greatly pleased; nor was there any one who, upon hearing the news, was
 not happy and elated. and the lady summons them all and requests them to
 go to meet him, to which they make no objection or remonstrance, all being
 anxious to do her will.
 (vv. -.)  mounted on great spanish
 steeds, they all go to meet the king of britain, saluting king arthur
 first with great courtesy and then all his company. "welcome," they say,
 "to this company, so full of honourable men! blessed be he who brings them
 hither and presents us with such fair guests!" at the king's arrival the
 town resounds with the joyous welcome which they give. silken stuffs are
 taken out and hung aloft as decorations, and they spread tapestries to
 walk upon and drape the streets with them, while they wait for the king's
 approach. and they make still another preparation, in covering the streets
 with awnings against the hot rays of the sun. bells, horns, and trumpets
 cause the town to ring so that god's thunder could not have been heard.
 the maidens dance before him, flutes and pipes are played, kettle-drums,
 drums, and cymbals are beaten. on their part the nimble youths leap, and
 all strive to show their delight. with such evidence of their joy, they
 welcome the king fittingly. and the lady came forth, dressed in imperial
 garb a robe of fresh ermine—and upon her head she wore a diadem all
 ornamented with rubies. no cloud was there upon her face, but it was so
 gay and full of joy that she was more beautiful, i think, than any
 goddess. around her the crowd pressed close, as they cried with one
 accord: "welcome to the king of kings and lord of lords!" the king could
 not reply to all before he saw the lady coming toward him to hold his
 stirrup. however, he would not wait for this, but hastened to dismount
 himself as soon as he caught sight of her. then she salutes him with these
 words: "welcome a hundred thousand times to the king, my lord, and blessed
 be his nephew, my lord gawain!" the king replies: "i wish all happiness
 and good luck to your fair body and your face, lovely creature!" then
 clasping her around the waist, the king embraced her gaily and heartily as
 she did him, throwing her arms about him. i will say no more of how gladly
 she welcomed them, but no one ever heard of any people who were so
 honourably received and served. i might tell you much of the joy should i
 not be wasting words, but i wish to make brief mention of an acquaintance
 which was made in private between the moon and the sun. do you know of
 whom i mean to speak? he who was lord of the knights, and who was renowned
 above them all, ought surely to be called the sun. i refer, of course, to
 my lord gawain, for chivalry is enhanced by him just as when the morning
 sun sheds its rays abroad and lights all places where it shines. and i
 call her the moon, who cannot be otherwise because of her sense and
 courtesy. however, i call her so not only because of her good repute, but
 because her name is, in fact, lunete.
 (vv. -.) the damsel's name was lunete, and she was a charming
 brunette, prudent, clever, and polite. as her acquaintance grows with my
 lord gawain, he values her highly and gives her his love as to his
 sweetheart, because she had saved from death his companion and friend; he
 places himself freely at her service. on her part she describes and
 relates to him with what difficulty she persuaded her mistress to take my
 lord yvain as her husband, and how she protected him from the hands of
 those who were seeking him; how he was in their midst but they did not see
 him. my lord gawain laughed aloud at this story of hers, and then he said:
 "mademoiselle, when you need me and when you don't, such as i am, i place
 myself at your disposal. never throw me off for some one else when you
 think you can improve your lot. i am yours, and do you be from now on my
 demoiselle!" "i thank you kindly, sire," she said. while the acquaintance
 of these two was ripening thus, the others, too, were engaged in flirting.
 for there were perhaps ninety ladies there, each of whom was fair and
 charming, noble and polite, virtuous and prudent, and a lady of exalted
 birth, so the men could agreeably employ themselves in caressing and
 kissing them, and in talking to them and in gazing at them while they were
 seated by their side; that much satisfaction they had at least. my lord
 yvain is in high feather because the king is lodged with him. and the lady
 bestows such attention upon them all, as individuals and collectively,
 that some foolish person might suppose that the charming attentions which
 she showed them were dictated by love. but such persons may properly be
 rated as fools for thinking that a lady is in love with them just because
 she is courteous and speaks to some unfortunate fellow, and makes him
 happy and caresses him. a fool is made happy by fair words, and is very
 easily taken in. that entire week they spent in gaiety; forest and stream
 offered plenty of sport for any one who desired it. and whoever wished to
 see the land which had come into the hands of my lord yvain with the lady
 whom he had married, could go to enjoy himself at one of the castles which
 stood within a radius of two, three, or four leagues. when the king had
 stayed as long as he chose, he made ready to depart. but during the week
 they had all begged urgently, and with all the insistence at their
 command, that they might take away my lord yvain with them. "what? will
 you be one of those." said my lord gawain to him, "who degenerate after
 marriage?  cursed be he by saint mary who
 marries and then degenerates! whoever has a fair lady as his mistress or
 his wife should be the better for it, and it is not right that her
 affection should be bestowed on him after his worth and reputation are
 gone. surely you, too, would have cause to regret her love if you grew
 soft, for a woman quickly withdraws her love, and rightly so, and despises
 him who degenerates in any way when he has become lord of the realm. now
 ought your fame to be increased! slip off the bridle and halter and come
 to the tournament with me, that no one may say that you are jealous. now
 you must no longer hesitate to frequent the lists, to share in the
 onslaught, and to contend with force, whatever effort it may cost!
 inaction produces indifference. but, really, you must come, for i shall be
 in your company. have a care that our comradeship shall not fail through
 any fault of yours, fair companion; for my part, you may count on me. it
 is strange how a man sets store by the life of ease which has no end.
 pleasures grow sweeter through postponement; and a little pleasure, when
 delayed, is much sweeter to the taste than great pleasure enjoyed at once.
 the sweets of a love which develops late are like a fire in a green bush;
 for the longer one delays in lighting it the greater will be the heat it
 yields, and the longer will its force endure. one may easily fall into
 habits which it is very difficult to shake off, for when one desires to do
 so, he finds he has lost the power. don't misunderstand my words, my
 friend: if i had such a fair mistress as you have, i call god and his
 saints to witness, i should leave her most reluctantly; indeed, i should
 doubtless be infatuated. but a man may give another counsel, which he
 would not take himself, just as the preachers, who are deceitful rascals,
 and preach and proclaim the right but who do not follow it themselves."
 (vv. -.) my lord gawain spoke at such length and so urgently that
 he promised him that he would go; but he said that he must consult his
 lady and ask for her consent. whether it be a foolish or a prudent thing
 to do, he will not fail to ask her leave to return to britain. then he
 took counsel with his wife, who had no inkling of the permission he
 desired, as he addressed her with these words: "my beloved lady, my heart
 and soul, my treasure, joy, and happiness, grant me now a favour which
 will redound to your honour and to mine." the lady at once gives her
 consent, not knowing what his desire is, and says: "fair lord, you may
 command me your pleasure, whatever it be." then my lord yvain at once asks
 her for permission to escort the king and to attend at tournaments, that
 no one may reproach his indolence. and she replies: "i grant you leave
 until a certain date; but be sure that my love will change to hate if you
 stay beyond the term that i shall fix. remember that i shall keep my word;
 if you break your word i will keep mine. if you wish to possess my love,
 and if you have any regard for me, remember to come back again at the
 latest a year from the present date a week after st. john's day; for
 to-day is the eighth day since that feast. you will be checkmated of my
 love if you are not restored to me on that day."
 (vv. -.) my lord yvain weeps and sighs so bitterly that he can
 hardly find words to say: "my lady, this date is indeed a long way off. if
 i could be a dove, whenever the fancy came to me, i should often rejoin
 you here. and i pray god that in his pleasure he may not detain me so long
 away. but sometimes a man intends speedily to return who knows not what
 the future has in store for him. and i know not what will be my fate—perhaps
 some urgency of sickness or imprisonment may keep me back: you are unjust
 in not making an exception at least of actual hindrance." "my lord," says
 she, "i will make that exception. and yet i dare to promise you that, if
 god deliver you from death, no hindrance will stand in your way so long as
 you remember me. so put on your finger now this ring of mine, which i lend
 to you. and i will tell you all about the stone: no true and loyal lover
 can be imprisoned or lose any blood, nor can any harm befall him, provided
 he carry it and hold it dear, and keep his sweetheart in mind. you will
 become as hard as iron, and it will serve you as shield and hauberk. i
 have never before been willing to lend or entrust it to any knight, but to
 you i give it because of my affection for you." now my lord yvain is free
 to go, but he weeps bitterly on taking leave. the king, however, would not
 tarry longer for anything that might be said: rather was he anxious to
 have the palfreys brought all equipped and bridled. they acceded at once
 to his desire, bringing the palfreys forth, so that it remained only to
 mount. i do not know whether i ought to tell you how my lord yvain took
 his leave, and of the kisses bestowed on him, mingled with tears and
 steeped in sweetness. and what shall i tell you about the king how the
 lady escorts him, accompanied by her damsels and seneschal? all this would
 require too much time. when he sees the lady's tears, the king implores
 her to come no farther, but to return to her abode. he begged her with
 such urgency that, heavy at heart, she turned about followed by her
 company.
 (vv. -.) my lord yvain is so distressed to leave his lady that his
 heart remains behind. the king may take his body off, but he cannot lead
 his heart away. she who stays behind clings so tightly to his heart that
 the king has not the power to take it away with him. when the body is left
 without the heart it cannot possibly live on. for such a marvel was never
 seen as the body alive without the heart. yet this marvel now came about:
 for he kept his body without the heart, which was wont to be enclosed in
 it, but which would not follow the body now. the heart has a good
 abiding-place, while the body, hoping for a safe return to its heart, in
 strange fashion takes a new heart of hope, which is so often deceitful and
 treacherous. he will never know in advance, i think, the hour when this
 hope will play him false, for if he overstays by single day the term which
 he has agreed upon, it will be hard for him to gain again his lady's
 pardon and goodwill. yet i think he will overstay the term, for my lord
 gawain will not allow him to part from him, as together they go to joust
 wherever tournaments are held. and as the year passes by my lord yvain had
 such success that my lord gawain strove to honour him, and caused him to
 delay so long that all the first year slipped by, and it came to the
 middle of august of the ensuing year, when the king held court at chester,
 whither they had returned the day before from a tournament where my lord
 yvain had been and where he had won the glory and the story tells how the
 two companions were unwilling to lodge in the town, but had their tents
 set up outside the city, and held court there. for they never went to the
 royal court, but the king came rather to join in theirs, for they had the
 best knights, and the greatest number, in their company. now king arthur
 was seated in their midst, when yvain suddenly had a thought which
 surprised him more than any that had occurred to him since he had taken
 leave of his lady, for he realised that he had broken his word, and that
 the limit of his leave was already exceeded. he could hardly keep back his
 tears, but he succeeded in doing so from shame. he was still deep in
 thought when he saw a damsel approaching rapidly upon a black palfrey with
 white forefeet. as she got down before the tent no one helped her to
 dismount, and no one went to take her horse. as soon as she made out the
 king, she let her mantle fall, and thus displayed she entered the tent and
 came before the king, announcing that her mistress sent greetings to the
 king, and to my lord gawain and all the other knights, except yvain, that
 disloyal traitor, liar, hypocrite, who had deserted her deceitfully. "she
 has seen clearly the treachery of him who pretended he was a faithful
 lover while he was a false and treacherous thief. this thief has traduced
 my lady, who was all unprepared for any evil, and to whom it never
 occurred that he would steal her heart away. those who love truly do not
 steal hearts away; there are, however, some men, by whom these former are
 called thieves, who themselves go about deceitfully making love, but in
 whom there is no real knowledge of the matter. the lover takes his lady's
 heart, of course, but he does not run away with it; rather does he
 treasure it against those thieves who, in the guise of honourable men,
 would steal it from him. but those are deceitful and treacherous thieves
 who vie with one another in stealing hearts for which they care nothing.
 the true lover, wherever he may go, holds the heart dear and brings it
 back again. but yvain has caused my lady's death, for she supposed that he
 would guard her heart for her, and would bring it back again before the
 year elapsed. yvain, thou wast of short memory when thou couldst not
 remember to return to thy mistress within a year. she gave thee thy
 liberty until st. john's day, and thou settest so little store by her that
 never since has a thought of her crossed thy mind. my lady had marked
 every day in her chamber, as the seasons passed: for when one is in love,
 one is ill at ease and cannot get any restful sleep, but all night long
 must needs count and reckon up the days as they come and go. dost thou
 know how lovers spend their time? they keep count of the time and the
 season. her complaint is not presented prematurely or without cause, and i
 am not accusing him in any way, but i simply say that we have been
 betrayed by him who married my lady. yvain, my mistress has no further
 care for thee, but sends thee word by me never to come back to her, and no
 longer to keep her ring. she bids thee send it back to her by me, whom
 thou seest present here. surrender it now, as thou art bound to do."
 (vv. -.) senseless and deprived of speech, yvain is unable to
 reply. and the damsel steps forth and takes the ring from his finger,
 commending to god the king and all the others except him, whom she leaves
 in deep distress. and his sorrow grows on him: he feels oppressed by what
 he hears, and is tormented by what he sees. he would rather be banished
 alone in some wild land, where no one would know where to seek for him,
 and where no man or woman would know of his whereabouts any more than if
 he were in some deep abyss. he hates nothing so much as he hates himself,
 nor does he know to whom to go for comfort in the death he has brought
 upon himself. but he would rather go insane than not take vengeance upon
 himself, deprived, as he is, of joy through his own fault. he rises from
 his place among the knights, fearing he will lose his mind if he stays
 longer in their midst. on their part, they pay no heed to him, but let him
 take his departure alone. they know well enough that he cares nothing for
 their talk or their society. and he goes away until he is far from the
 tents and pavilions. then such a storm broke loose in his brain that he
 loses his senses; he tears his flesh and, stripping off his clothes, he
 flees across the meadows and fields, leaving his men quite at a loss, and
 wondering what has become of him.  they go
 in search of him through all the country around—in the lodgings of
 the knights, by the hedgerows, and in the gardens—but they seek him
 where he is not to be found. still fleeing, he rapidly pursued his way
 until he met close by a park a lad who had in his hand a bow and five
 barbed arrows, which were very sharp and broad. he had sense enough to go
 and take the bow and arrows which he held. however, he had no recollection
 of anything that he had done. he lies in wait for the beasts in the woods,
 killing them, and then eating the venison raw. thus he dwelt in the forest
 like a madman or a savage, until he came upon a little, low-lying house
 belonging to a hermit, who was at work clearing his ground. when he saw
 him coming with nothing on, he could easily perceive that he was not in
 his right mind; and such was the case, as the hermit very well knew. so,
 in fear, he shut himself up in his little house, and taking some bread and
 fresh water, he charitably set it outside the house on a narrow
 window-ledge. and thither the other comes, hungry for the bread which he
 takes and eats. i do not believe that he ever before had tasted such hard
 and bitter bread. the measure of barley kneaded with the straw, of which
 the bread, sourer than yeast, was made, had not cost more than five sous;
 and the bread was musty and as dry as bark. but hunger torments and whets
 his appetite, so that the bread tasted to him like sauce. for hunger is
 itself a well mixed and concocted sauce for any food. my lord yvain soon
 ate the hermit's bread, which tasted good to him, and drank the cool water
 from the jar. when he had eaten, he betook himself again to the woods in
 search of stags and does. and when he sees him going away, the good man
 beneath his roof prays god to defend him and guard him lest he ever pass
 that way again. but there is no creature, with howsoever little sense,
 that will not gladly return to a place where he is kindly treated. so, not
 a day passed while he was in this mad fit that he did not bring to his
 door some wild game. such was the life he led; and the good man took it
 upon himself to remove the skin and set a good quantity of the venison to
 cook; and the bread and the water in the jug was always standing on the
 window-ledge for the madman to make a meal. thus he had something to eat
 and drink: venison without salt or pepper, and good cool water from the
 spring. and the good man exerted himself to sell the hide and buy bread
 made of barley, or oats, or of some other grain; so, after that, yvain had
 a plentiful supply of bread and venison, which sufficed him for a long
 time, until one day he was found asleep in the forest by two damsels and
 their mistress, in whose service they were. when they saw the naked man,
 one of the three ran and dismounted and examined him closely, before she
 saw anything about him which would serve to identify him. if he had only
 been richly attired, as he had been many a time, and if she could have
 seen him then she would have known him quickly enough. but she was slow to
 recognise him, and continued to look at him until at last she noticed a
 scar which he had on his face, and she recollected that my lord yvain's
 face was scarred in this same way; she was sure of it, for she had often
 seen it. because of the scar she saw that it was he beyond any doubt; but
 she marvelled greatly how it came about that she found him thus poor and
 stripped. often she crosses herself in amazement, but she does not touch
 him or wake him up; rather does she mount her horse again, and going back
 to the others, tells them tearfully of her adventure. i do not know if i
 ought to delay to tell you of the grief she showed; but thus she spoke
 weeping to her mistress: "my lady, i have found yvain, who has proved
 himself to be the best knight in the world, and the most virtuous. i
 cannot imagine what sin has reduced the gentleman to such a plight. i
 think he must have had some misfortune, which causes him thus to demean
 himself, for one may lose his wits through grief. and any one can see that
 he is not in his right mind, for it would surely never be like him to
 conduct himself thus indecently unless he had lost his mind. would that
 god had restored to him the best sense he ever had, and would that he
 might then consent to render assistance to your cause! for count alier,
 who is at war with you, has made upon you a fierce attack. i should see
 the strife between you two quickly settled in your favour if god favoured
 your fortunes so that he should return to his senses and undertake to aid
 you in this stress." to this the lady made reply: "take care now! for
 surely, if he does not escape, with god's help i think we can clear his
 head of all the madness and insanity. but we must be on our way at once!
 for i recall a certain ointment with which morgan the wise presented me,
 saying there was no delirium of the head which it would not cure."
 thereupon, they go off at once toward the town, which was hard by, for it
 was not any more than half a league of the kind they have in that country;
 and, as compared with ours, two of their leagues make one and four make
 two. and he remains sleeping all alone, while the lady goes to fetch the
 ointment. the lady opens a case of hers, and, taking out a box, gives it
 to the damsel, and charges her not to be too prodigal in its use: she
 should rub only his temples with it, for there is no use of applying it
 elsewhere; she should anoint only his temples with it, and the remainder
 she should carefully keep, for there is nothing the matter with him except
 in his brain. she sends him also a robe of spotted fur, a coat, and a
 mantle of scarlet silk. the damsel takes them, and leads in her right hand
 an excellent palfrey. and she added to these, of her own store, a shirt,
 some soft hose, and some new drawers of proper cut. with all these things
 she quickly set out, and found him still asleep where she had left him.
 after putting her horse in an enclosure where she tied him fast, she came
 with the clothes and the ointment to the place where he was asleep. then
 she made so bold as to approach the madman, so that she could touch and
 handle him: then taking the ointment she rubbed him with it until none
 remained in the box, being so solicitous for his recovery that she
 proceeded to anoint him all over with it; and she used it so freely that
 she heeded not the warning of her mistress, nor indeed did she remember
 it. she put more on than was needed, but in her opinion it was well
 employed. she rubbed his temples and forehead, and his whole body down to
 the ankles. she rubbed his temples and his whole body so much there in the
 hot sunshine that the madness and the depressing gloom passed completely
 out of his brain. but she was foolish to anoint his body, for of that
 there was no need. if she had had five measures of it she would doubtless
 have done the same thing. she carries off the box, and takes hidden refuge
 by her horse. but she leaves the robe behind, wishing that, if god calls
 him back to life, he may see it all laid out, and may take it and put it
 on. she posts herself behind an oak tree until he had slept enough, and
 was cured and quite restored, having regained his wits and memory. then he
 sees that he is as naked as ivory, and feels much ashamed; but he would
 have been yet more ashamed had he known what had happened. as it is, he
 knows nothing but that he is naked. he sees the new robe lying before him,
 and marvels greatly how and by what adventure it had come there. but he is
 ashamed and concerned, because of his nakedness, and says that he is dead
 and utterly undone if any one has come upon him there and recognised him.
 meanwhile, he clothes himself and looks out into the forest to see if any
 one was approaching. he tries to stand up and support himself, but cannot
 summon the strength to walk away, for his sickness has so affected him
 that he can scarcely stand upon his feet. thereupon, the damsel resolves
 to wait no longer, but, mounting, she passed close by him, as if unaware
 of his presence. quite indifferent as to whence might come the help, which
 he needed so much to lead him away to some lodging-place, where he might
 recruit his strength, he calls out to her with all his might. and the
 damsel, for her part, looks about her as if not knowing what the trouble
 is. confused, she goes hither and thither, not wishing to go straight up
 to him. then he begins to call again: "damsel, come this way, here!" and
 the damsel guided toward him her soft-stepping palfrey. by this ruse she
 made him think that she knew nothing of him and had never seen him before;
 in so doing she was wise and courteous. when she had come before him, she
 said: "sir knight, what do you desire that you call me so insistently?"
 "ah," said he, "prudent damsel, i have found myself in this wood by some
 mishap—i know not what. for god's sake and your belief in him, i
 pray you to lend me, taking my word as pledge, or else to give me
 outright, that palfrey you are leading in your hand." "gladly, sire: but
 you must accompany me whither i am going." "which way?" says he. "to a
 town that stands near by, beyond the forest." "tell me, damsel, if you
 stand in need of me." "yes," she says, "i do; but i think you are not very
 well. for the next two weeks at least you ought to rest. take this horse,
 which i hold in my right hand, and we shall go to our lodging-place." and
 he, who had no other desire, takes it and mounts, and they proceed until
 they come to a bridge over a swift and turbulent stream. and the damsel
 throws into the water the empty box she is carrying, thinking to excuse
 herself to her mistress for her ointment by saying that she was so unlucky
 as to let the box fall into the water for, when her palfrey stumbled under
 her, the box slipped from her gasp, and she came near falling in too,
 which would have been still worse luck. it is her intention to invent this
 story when she comes into her mistress' presence. together they held their
 way until they came to the town, where the lady detained my lord yvain and
 asked her damsel in private for her box and ointment: and the damsel
 repeated to her the lie as she had invented it, not daring to tell her the
 truth. then the lady was greatly enraged, and said: "this is certainly a
 very serious loss, and i am sure and certain that the box will never be
 found again. but since it has happened so, there is nothing more to be
 done about it. one often desires a blessing which turns out to be a curse;
 thus i, who looked for a blessing and joy from this knight, have lost the
 dearest and most precious of my possessions. however, i beg you to serve
 him in all respects." "ah, lady, how wisely now you speak! for it would be
 too bad to convert one misfortune into two."
 (vv. -.) then they say no more about the box, but minister in
 every way they can to the comfort of my lord yvain, bathing him and
 washing his hair, having him shaved and clipped, for one could have taken
 up a fist full of hair upon his face. his every want is satisfied: if he
 asks for arms, they are furnished him: if he wants a horse, they provide
 him with one that is large and handsome, strong and spirited. he stayed
 there until, upon a tuesday, count alier came to the town with his men and
 knights, who started fires and took plunder. those in the town at once
 rose up and equipped themselves with arms. some armed and some unarmed,
 they issued forth to meet the plunderers, who did not deign to retreat
 before them, but awaited them in a narrow pass. my lord yvain struck at
 the crowd; he had had so long a rest that his strength was quite restored,
 and he struck a knight upon his shield with such force that he sent down
 in a heap, i think, the knight together with his horse. the knight never
 rose again, for his backbone was broken and his heart burst within his
 breast. my lord yvain drew back a little to recover. then protecting
 himself completely with his shield, he spurred forward to clear the pass.
 one could not have counted up to four before one would have seen him cast
 down speedily four knights. whereupon, those who were with him waxed more
 brave, for many a man of poor and timid heart, at the sight of some brave
 man who attacks a dangerous task before his eyes, will be overwhelmed by
 confusion and shame, which will drive out the poor heart in his body and
 give him another like to a hero's for courage. so these men grew brave and
 each stood his ground in the fight and attack. and the lady was up in the
 tower, whence she saw the fighting and the rush to win and gain possession
 of the pass, and she saw lying upon the ground many who were wounded and
 many killed, both of her own party and of the enemy, but more of the enemy
 than of her own. for my courteous, bold, and excellent lord yvain made
 them yield just as a falcon does the teal. and the men and women who had
 remained within the town declared as they watched the strife: "ah, what a
 valiant knight! how he makes his enemies yield, and how fierce is his
 attack! he was about him as a lion among the fallow deer, when he is
 impelled by need and hunger. then, too, all our other knights are more
 brave and daring because of him, for, were it not for him alone, not a
 lance would have been splintered nor a sword drawn to strike. when such an
 excellent man is found he ought to be loved and dearly prized. see now how
 he proves himself, see how he maintains his place, see how he stains with
 blood his lance and bare sword, see how he presses the enemy and follows
 them up, how he comes boldly to attack them, then gives away and turns
 about; but he spends little time in giving away, and soon returns to the
 attack. see him in the fray again, how lightly he esteems his shield,
 which he allows to be cut in pieces mercilessly. just see how keen he is
 to avenge the blows which are dealt at him. for, if some one should use
 all the forest of argone  to make lances for him, i
 guess he would have none left by night. for he breaks all the lances that
 they place in his socket, and calls for more. and see how he wields the
 sword when he draws it! roland never wrought such havoc with durendal
 against the turks at ronceval or in spain!  if he
 had in his company some good companions like himself, the traitor, whose
 attack we are suffering, would retreat today discomfited, or would stand
 his ground only to find defeat." then they say that the woman would be
 blessed who should be loved by one who is so powerful in arms, and who
 above all others may be recognised as a taper among candles, as a moon
 among the stars, and as the sun above the moon. he so won the hearts of
 all that the prowess which they see in him made them wish that he had
 taken their lady to wife, and that he were master of the land.
 (vv. -.) thus men and women alike praised him, and in doing so
 they but told the truth. for his attack on his adversaries was such that
 they vie with one another in flight. but he presses hard upon their heels,
 and all his companions follow him, for by his side they feel as safe as if
 they were enclosed in a high and thick stone wall. the pursuit continues
 until those who flee become exhausted, and the pursuers slash at them and
 disembowel their steeds. the living roll over upon the dead as they wound
 and kill each other. they work dreadful destruction upon each other; and
 meanwhile the count flees with my lord yvain after him, until he comes up
 with him at the foot of a steep ascent, near the entrance of a strong
 place which belonged to the count. there the count was stopped, with no
 one near to lend him aid; and without any excessive parley my lord yvain
 received his surrender. for as soon as he held him in his hands, and they
 were left just man to man, there was no further possibility of escape, or
 of yielding, or of self-defence; so the count pledged his word to go to
 surrender to the lady of noroison as her prisoner, and to make such peace
 as she might dictate. and when he had accepted his word he made him disarm
 his head and remove the shield from about his neck, and the count
 surrendered to him his sword. thus he won the honour of leading off the
 count as his prisoner, and of giving him over to his enemies, who make no
 secret of their joy. but the news was carried to the town before they
 themselves arrived. while all come forth to meet them, the lady herself
 leads the way. my lord yvain holds his prisoner by the hand, and presents
 him to her. the count gladly acceded to her wishes and demands, and
 secured her by his word, oath, and pledges. giving her pledges, he swears
 to her that he will always live on peaceful terms with her, and will make
 good to her all the loss which she can prove, and will build up again the
 houses which he had destroyed. when these things were agreed upon in
 accordance with the lady's wish, my lord yvain asked leave to depart. but
 she would not have granted him this permission had he been willing to take
 her as his mistress, or to marry her. but he would not allow himself to be
 followed or escorted a single step, but rather departed hastily: in this
 case entreaty was of no avail. so he started out to retrace his path,
 leaving the lady much chagrined, whose joy he had caused a while before.
 when he will not tarry longer she is the more distressed and ill at ease
 in proportion to the happiness he had brought to her, for she would have
 wished to honour him, and would have made him, with his consent, lord of
 all her possessions, or else she would have paid him for his services
 whatever sum he might have named. but he would not heed any word of man or
 woman. despite their grief he left the knights and the lady who vainly
 tried to detain him longer.
 (vv. -.) pensively my lord yvain proceeded through a deep wood,
 until he heard among the trees a very loud and dismal cry, and he turned
 in the direction whence it seemed to come. and when he had arrived upon
 the spot he saw in a cleared space a lion, and a serpent which held him by
 the tail, burning his hind-quarters with flames of fire. my lord yvain did
 not gape at this strange spectacle, but took counsel with himself as to
 which of the two he should aid. then he says that he will succour the
 lion, for a treacherous and venomous creature deserves to be harmed. now
 the serpent is poisonous, and fire bursts forth from its mouth—so
 full of wickedness is the creature. so my lord yvain decides that he will
 kill the serpent first. drawing his sword he steps forward, holding the
 shield before his face in order not to be harmed by the flame emerging
 from the creature's throat, which was larger than a pot. if the lion
 attacks him next, he too shall have all the fight he wishes; but whatever
 may happen afterwards he makes up his mind to help him now. for pity urges
 him and makes request that he should bear succour and aid to the gentle
 and noble beast. with his sword, which cuts so clean, he attacks the
 wicked serpent, first cleaving him through to the earth and cutting him in
 two, then continuing his blows until he reduces him to tiny bits. but he
 had to cut off a piece of the lion's tail to get at the serpent's head,
 which held the lion by the tail. he cut off only so much as was necessary
 and unavoidable. when he had set the lion free, he supposed that he would
 have to fight with him, and that the lion would come at him; but the lion
 was not minded so. just hear now what the lion did! he acted nobly and as
 one well-bred; for he began to make it evident that he yielded himself to
 him, by standing upon his two hind-feet and bowing his face to the earth,
 with his fore-feet joined and stretched out toward him. then he fell on
 his knees again, and all his face was wet with the tears of humility. my
 lord yvain knows for a truth that the lion is thanking him and doing him
 homage because of the serpent which he had killed, thereby delivering him
 from death. he was greatly pleased by this episode. he cleaned his sword
 of the serpent's poison and filth; then he replaced it in its scabbard,
 and resumed his way. and the lion walks close by his side, unwilling
 henceforth to part from him: he will always in future accompany him, eager
 to serve and protect him.  he goes ahead until he scents
 in the wind upon his way some wild beasts feeding; then hunger and his
 nature prompt him to seek his prey and to secure his sustenance. it is his
 nature so to do. he started ahead a little on the trail, thus showing his
 master that he had come upon and detected the odour and scent of some wild
 game. then he looks at him and halts, wishing to serve his every wish, and
 unwilling to proceed against his will. yvain understands by his attitude
 that he is showing that he awaits his pleasure. he perceives this and
 understands that if he holds back he will hold back too, and that if he
 follows him he will seize the game which he has scented. then he incites
 and cries to him, as he would do to hunting-dogs. at once the lion
 directed his nose to the scent which he had detected, and by which he was
 not deceived, for he had not gone a bow-shot when he saw in a valley a
 deer grazing all alone. this deer he will seize, if he has his way. and so
 he did, at the first spring, and then drank its blood still warm. when he
 had killed it he laid it upon his back and carried it back to his master,
 who thereupon conceived a greater affection for him, and chose him as a
 companion for all his life, because of the great devotion he found in him.
 it was near nightfall now, and it seemed good to him to spend the night
 there, and strip from the deer as much as he cared to eat. beginning to
 carve it he splits the skin along the rib, and taking a steak from the
 loin he strikes from a flint a spark, which he catches in some dry
 brush-wood; then he quickly puts his steak upon a roasting spit to cook
 before the fire, and roasts it until it is quite cooked through. but there
 was no pleasure in the meal, for there was no bread, or wine, or salt, or
 cloth, or knife, or anything else. while he was eating, the lion lay at
 his feet; nor a movement did he make, but watched him steadily until he
 had eaten all that he could eat of the steak. what remained of the deer
 the lion devoured, even to the bones. and while all night his master laid
 his head upon his shield to gain such rest as that afforded, the lion
 showed such intelligence that he kept awake, and was careful to guard the
 horse as it fed upon the grass, which yielded some slight nourishment.
 (vv. -.) in the morning they go off together, and the same sort of
 existence, it seems, as they had led that night, they two continued to
 lead all the ensuing week, until chance brought them to the spring beneath
 the pine-tree. there my lord yvain almost lost his wits a second time, as
 he approached the spring, with its stone and the chapel that stood close
 by. so great was his distress that a thousand times he sighed "alas!" and
 grieving fell in a swoon; and the point of his sharp sword, falling from
 its scabbard, pierced the meshes of his hauberk right in the neck beside
 the cheek. there is not a mesh that does not spread, and the sword cuts
 the flesh of his neck beneath the shining mail, so that it causes the
 blood to start. then the lion thinks that he sees his master and companion
 dead. you never heard greater grief narrated or told about anything than
 he now began to show. he casts himself about, and scratches and cries, and
 has the wish to kill himself with the sword with which he thinks his
 master has killed himself. taking the sword from him with his teeth he
 lays it on a fallen tree, and steadies it on a trunk behind, so that it
 will not slip or give way, when he hurls his breast against it, his
 intention was nearly accomplished when his master recovered from his
 swoon, and the lion restrained himself as he was blindly rushing upon
 death, like a wild boar heedless of where he wounds himself. thus my lord
 yvain lies in a swoon beside the stone, but, on recovering, he violently
 reproached himself for the year during which he had overstayed his leave,
 and for which he had incurred his lady's hate, and he said: "why does this
 wretch not kill himself who has thus deprived himself of joy? alas! why do
 i not take my life? how can i stay here and look upon what belongs to my
 lady? why does the soul still tarry in my body? what is the soul doing in
 so miserable a frame? if it had already escaped away it would not be in
 such torment. it is fitting to hate and blame and despise myself, even as
 in fact i do. whoever loses his bliss and contentment through fault or
 error of his own ought to hate himself mortally. he ought to hate and kill
 himself. and now, when no one is looking on, why do i thus spare myself?
 why do i not take my life? have i not seen this lion a prey to such grief
 on my behalf that he was on the point just now of thrusting my sword
 through his breast? and ought i to fear death who have changed happiness
 into grief? joy is now a stranger to me. joy? what joy is that? i shall
 say no more of that, for no one could speak of such a thing; and i have
 asked a foolish question. that was the greatest joy of all which was
 assured as my possession, but it endured for but a little while. whoever
 loses such joy through his own misdeed is undeserving of happiness."
 (vv. -.) while he thus bemoaned his fate, a lorn damsel in sorry
 plight, who was in the chapel, saw him and heard his words through a crack
 in the wall. as soon as he was recovered from his swoon, she called to
 him: "god," said she, "who is that i hear? who is it that thus complains?"
 and he replied: "and who are you?" "i am a wretched one," she said, "the
 most miserable thing alive." and he replied: "be silent, foolish one! thy
 grief is joy and thy sorrow is bliss compared with that in which i am cast
 down. in proportion as a man becomes more accustomed to happiness and joy,
 so is he more distracted and stunned than any other man by sorrow when it
 comes. a man of little strength can carry, through custom and habit, a
 weight which another man of greater strength could not carry for
 anything." "upon my word," she said, "i know the truth of that remark; but
 that is no reason to believe that your misfortune is worse than mine.
 indeed, i do not believe it at all, for it seems to me that you can go
 anywhere you choose to go, whereas i am imprisoned here, and such a fate
 is my portion that to-morrow i shall be seized and delivered to mortal
 judgment." "ah, god!" said he, "and for what crime?" "sir knight, may god
 never have mercy upon my soul, if i have merited such a fate!
 nevertheless, i shall tell you truly, without deception, why i am here in
 prison: i am charged with treason, and i cannot find any one to defend me
 from being burned or hanged to-morrow." "in the first place," he replied,
 "i may say that my grief and woe are greater than yours, for you may yet
 be delivered by some one from the peril in which you are. is that not
 true:" "yes, but i know not yet by whom. there are only two men in the
 world who would dare on my behalf to face three men in battle." "what? in
 god's name, are there three of them?" "yes, sire, upon my word. there are
 three who accuse me of treachery." "and who are they who are so devoted to
 you that either one of them would be bold enough to fight against three in
 your defence?" "i will answer your question truthfully: one of them is my
 lord gawain, and the other is my lord yvain, because of whom i shall
 to-morrow be handed over unjustly to the martyrdom of death." "because of
 whom?" he asked, "what did you say?" "sire, so help me god, because of the
 son of king urien." "now i understand your words, but you shall not die,
 without he dies too. i myself am that yvain, because of whom you are in
 such distress. and you, i take it, are she who once guarded me safely in
 the hall, and saved my life and my body between the two portcullises, when
 i was troubled and distressed, and alarmed at being trapped. i should have
 been killed or seized, had it not been for your kind aid. now tell me, my
 gentle friend, who are those who now accuse you of treachery, and have
 confined you in this lonely place?" "sire, i shall not conceal it from
 you, since you desire me to tell you all. it is a fact that i was not slow
 in honestly aiding you. upon my advice my lady received you, after heeding
 my opinion and my counsel. and by the holy paternoster, more for her
 welfare than for your own i thought i was doing it, and i think so still.
 so much now i confess to you: it was her honour and your desire that i
 sought to serve, so help me god! but when it became evident that you had
 overstayed the year when you should return to my mistress, then she became
 enraged at me, and thought that she had been deceived by putting trust in
 my advice. and when this was discovered by the seneschal—a rascally,
 underhanded, disloyal wretch, who was jealous of me because in many
 matters my lady trusted me more than she trusted him, he saw that he could
 now stir up great enmity between me and her. in full court and in the
 presence of all he accused me of having betrayed her in your favour. and i
 had no counsel or aid except my own; but i knew that i had never done or
 conceived any treacherous act toward my lady, so i cried out, as one
 beside herself, and without the advice of any one, that i would present in
 my own defence one knight who should fight against three. the fellow was
 not courteous enough to scorn to accept such odds, nor was i at liberty to
 retreat or withdraw for anything that might happen. so he took me at my
 word, and i was compelled to furnish bail that i would present within
 forty days a knight to do battle against three knights. since then i have
 visited many courts; i was at king arthur's court, but found no help from
 any there, nor did i find any one who could tell me any good news of you,
 for they knew nothing of your affairs." "pray tell me. where then was my
 good and gentle lord gawain? no damsel in distress ever needed his aid
 without its being extended to her." "if i had found him at court, i could
 not have asked him for anything which would have been refused me; but a
 certain knight has carried off the queen, so they told me; surely the king
 was mad to send her off in his company.  i
 believe it was kay who escorted her to meet the knight who has taken her
 away; and my lord gawain in great distress has gone in search for her. he
 will never have any rest until he finds her. now i have told you the whole
 truth of my adventure. to-morrow i shall be put to a shameful death, and
 shall be burnt inevitably, a victim of your criminal neglect." and he
 replies: "may god forbid that you should be harmed because of me! so long
 as i live you shall not die! you may expect me tomorrow, prepared to the
 extent of my power to present my body in your cause, as it is proper that
 i should do. but have no concern to tell the people who i am! however the
 battle may turn out, take care that i be not recognised!" "surely, sire,
 no pressure could make me reveal your name. i would sooner suffer death,
 since you will have it so. yet, after all, i beg you not to return for my
 sake. i would not have you undertake a battle which will be so desperate.
 i thank you for your promised word that you would gladly undertake it, but
 consider yourself now released, for it is better that i should die alone
 than that i should see them rejoice over your death as well as mine; they
 would not spare my life after they had put you to death. so it is better
 for you to remain alive than that we both should meet death." "that is
 very ungrateful remark, my dear," says my lord yvain; "i suppose that
 either you do not wish to be delivered from death, or else that you scorn
 the comfort i bring you with my aid. i will not discuss the matter more,
 for you have surely done so much for me that i cannot fail you in any
 need. i know that you are in great distress; but, if it be god's will, in
 whom i trust, they shall all three be discomfited. so no more upon that
 score: i am going off now to find some shelter in this wood, for there is
 no dwelling near at hand." "sire," she says, "may god give you both good
 shelter and good night, and protect you as i desire from everything that
 might do you harm!" then my lord yvain departs, and the lion as usual
 after him. they journeyed until they came to a baron's fortified place,
 which was completely surrounded by a massive, strong, and high wall. the
 castle, being extraordinarily well protected, feared no assault of
 catapult or storming-machine; but outside the walls the ground was so
 completely cleared that not a single hut or dwelling remained standing.
 you will learn the cause of this a little later, when the time comes. my
 lord yvain made his way directly toward the fortified place, and seven
 varlets came out who lowered the bridge and advanced to meet him. but they
 were terrified at sight of the lion, which they saw with him, and asked
 him kindly to leave the lion at the gate lest he should wound or kill
 them. and he replies: "say no more of that! for i shall not enter without
 him. either we shall both find shelter here or else i shall stay outside;
 he is as dear to me as i am myself. yet you need have no fear of him! for
 i shall keep him so well in hand that you may be quite confident." they
 made answer: "very well!" then they entered the town, and passed on until
 they met knights and ladies and charming damsels coming down the street,
 who salute him and wait to remove his armour as they say: "welcome to our
 midst, fair sire! and may god grant that you tarry here until you may
 leave with great honour and satisfaction!" high and low alike extend to
 him a glad welcome, and do all they can for him, as they joyfully escort
 him into the town. but after they had expressed their gladness they are
 overwhelmed by grief, which makes them quickly forget their joy, as they
 begin to lament and weep and beat themselves. thus, for a long space of
 time, they cease not to rejoice or make lament: it is to honour their
 guest that they rejoice, but their heart is not in what they do, for they
 are greatly worried over an event which they expect to take place on the
 following day, and they feel very sure and certain that it will come to
 pass before midday. my lord yvain was so surprised that they so often
 changed their mood, and mingled grief with their happiness, that he
 addressed the lord of the place on the subject. "for god's sake," he said,
 "fair gentle sir, will you kindly inform me why you have thus honoured me,
 and shown at once such joy and such heaviness?" "yes, if you desire to
 know, but it would be better for you to desire ignorance and silence. i
 will never tell you willingly anything to cause you grief. allow us to
 continue to lament, and do you pay no attention to what we do!" "it would
 be quite impossible for me to see you sad and nor take it upon my heart,
 so i desire to know the truth, whatever chagrin may result to me." "well,
 then," he said, "i will tell you all. i have suffered much from a giant,
 who has insisted that i should give him my daughter, who surpasses in
 beauty all the maidens in the world. this evil giant, whom may god
 confound, is named harpin of the mountain. not a day passes without his
 taking all of my possessions upon which he can lay his hands. no one has a
 better right than i to complain, and to be sorrowful, and to make lament.
 i might well lose my senses from very grief, for i had six sons who were
 knights, fairer than any i knew in the world, and the giant has taken all
 six of them. before my eyes he killed two of them, and to-morrow he will
 kill the other four, unless i find some one who will dare to fight him for
 the deliverance of my sons, or unless i consent to surrender my daughter
 to him; and he says that when he has her in his possession he will give
 her over to be the sport of the vilest and lewdest fellows in his house,
 for he would scorn to take her now for himself. that is the disaster which
 awaits me to-morrow, unless the lord god grant me his aid. so it is no
 wonder, fair sir, if we are all in tears. but for your sake we strive for
 the moment to assume as cheerful a countenance as we can. for he is a fool
 who attracts a gentleman to his presence and then does not honour him; and
 you seem to be a very perfect gentleman. now i have told you the entire
 story of our great distress. neither in town nor in fortress has the giant
 left us anything, except what we have here. if you had noticed, you must
 have seen this evening that he has not left us so much as an egg, except
 these walls which are new; for he has razed the entire town. when he had
 plundered all he wished, he set fire to what remained. in this way he has
 done me many an evil turn."
 (vv. -.) my lord yvain listened to all that his host told him, and
 when he had heard it all he was pleased to answer him: "sire, i am sorry
 and distressed about this trouble of yours; but i marvel greatly that you
 have not asked assistance at good king arthur's court. there is no man so
 mighty that he could not find at his court some who would be glad to try
 their strength with his." then the wealthy man reveals and explains to him
 that he would have had efficient help if he had known where to find my
 lord gawain. "he would not have failed me upon this occasion, for my wife
 is his own sister; but a knight from a strange land, who went to court to
 seek the king's wife, has led her away. however, he could not have gotten
 possession of her by any means of his own invention, had it not been for
 kay, who so befooled the king that he gave the queen into his charge and
 placed her under his protection. he was a fool, and she imprudent to
 entrust herself to his escort. and i am the one who suffers and loses in
 all this; for it is certain that my excellent lord gawain would have made
 haste to come here, had he known the facts, for the sake of his nephews
 and his niece. but he knows nothing of it, wherefore i am so distressed
 that my heart is almost breaking, for he is gone in pursuit of him, to
 whom may god bring shame and woe for having led the queen away." while
 listening to this recital my lord yvain does not cease to sigh. inspired
 by the pity which he feels, he makes this reply: "fair gentle sire, i
 would gladly undertake this perilous adventure, if the giant and your sons
 should arrive to-morrow in time to cause me no delay, for tomorrow at noon
 i shall be somewhere else, in accordance with a promise i have made."
 "once for all, fair sire," the good man said, "i thank you a hundred
 thousand times for your willingness." and all the people of the house
 likewise expressed their gratitude.
 (vv. -.) just then the damsel came out of a room, with her
 graceful body and her face so fair and pleasing to look upon. she was very
 simple and sad and quiet as she came, for there was no end to the grief
 she felt: she walked with her head bowed to the ground. and her mother,
 too, came in from an adjoining room, for the gentleman had sent for them
 to meet his guest. they entered with their mantles wrapped about them to
 conceal their tears; and he bid them throw back their mantles, and hold up
 their heads, saying: "you ought not to hesitate to obey my behests, for
 god and good fortune have given us here a very well-born gentleman who
 assures me that he will fight against the giant. delay no longer now to
 throw yourselves at his feet!" "may god never let me see that!" my lord
 yvain hastens to exclaim; "surely it would not be proper under any
 circumstances for the sister and the niece of my lord gawain to prostrate
 themselves at my feet. may god defend me from ever giving place to such
 pride as to let them fall at my feet! indeed, i should never forget the
 shame which i should feel; but i should be very glad if they would take
 comfort until to-morrow, when they may see whether god will consent to aid
 them. i have no other request to make, except that the giant may come in
 such good time that i be not compelled to break my engagement elsewhere;
 for i would not fail for anything to be present to-morrow noon at the
 greatest business i could ever undertake." thus he is unwilling to
 reassure them completely, for he fears that the giant may not come early
 enough to allow him to reach in time the damsel who is imprisoned in the
 chapel. nevertheless, he promises them enough to arouse good hope in them.
 they all alike join in thanking him, for they place great confidence in
 his prowess, and they think he must be a very good man, when they see the
 lion by his side as confident as a lamb would be. they take comfort and
 rejoice because of the hope they stake on him, and they indulge their
 grief no more. when the time came they led him off to bed in a brightly
 lighted room; both the damsel and her mother escorted him, for they prized
 him dearly, and would have done so a hundred thousand times more had they
 been informed of his prowess and courtesy. he and the lion together lay
 down there and took their rest. the others dared not sleep in the room;
 but they closed the door so tight that they could not come out until the
 next day at dawn. when the room was thrown open he got up and heard mass,
 and then, because of the promise he had made, he waited until the hour of
 prime. then in the hearing of all he summoned the lord of the town and
 said: "my lord, i have no more time to wait, but must ask your permission
 to leave at once; i cannot tarry longer here. but believe truly that i
 would gladly and willingly stay here yet awhile for the sake of the
 nephews and the niece of my beloved lord gawain, if i did not have a great
 business on hand, and if it were not so far away." at this the damsel's
 blood quivered and boiled with fear, as well as the lady's and the lord's.
 they were so afraid he would go away that they were on the point of
 humbling themselves and casting themselves at his feet, when they recalled
 that he would not approve or permit their action. then the lord makes him
 an offer of all he will take of his lands or wealth, if only he will wait
 a little longer. and he replied: "god forbid that ever i should take
 anything of yours!" then the damsel, who is in dismay, begins to weep
 aloud, and beseeches him to stay. like one distracted and prey to dread,
 she begs him by the glorious queen of heaven and of the angels, and by the
 lord, not to go but to wait a little while; and then, too, for her uncle's
 sake, whom he says he knows, and loves, and esteems. then his heart is
 touched with deep pity when he hears her adjuring him in the name of him
 whom he loves the most, and by the mistress of heaven, and by the lord,
 who is the very honey and sweet savour of pity. filled with anguish he
 heaved a sigh, for were the kingdom of tarsus at stake he would not see
 her burned to whom he had pledged his aid. if he could not reach her in
 time, he would be unable to endure his life, or would live on without his
 wits on the other hand, the kindness of his friend, my lord gawain, only
 increased his distress; his heart almost bursts in half at the thought
 that he cannot delay. nevertheless, he does not stir, but delays and waits
 so long that the giant came suddenly, bringing with him the knights: and
 hanging from his neck he carried a big square stake with a pointed end,
 and with this he frequently spurred them on. for their part they had no
 clothing on that was worth a straw, except some soiled and filthy shirts:
 and their feet and hands were bound with cords, as they came riding upon
 four limping jades, which were weak, and thin, and miserable. as they came
 riding along beside a wood, a dwarf, who was puffed up like a toad, had
 tied the horses' tails together, and walked beside them, beating them
 remorselessly with a four-knotted scourge until they bled, thinking
 thereby to be doing something wonderful. thus they were brought along in
 shame by the giant and the dwarf. stopping in the plain in front of the
 city gate, the giant shouts out to the noble lord that he will kill his
 sons unless he delivers to him his daughter, whom he will surrender to his
 vile fellows to become their sport. for he no longer loves her nor esteems
 her, that he should deign to abase himself to her. she shall be constantly
 beset by a thousand lousy and ragged knaves, vacant wretches, and scullery
 boys, who all shall lay hands on her. the worthy man is well-nigh beside
 himself when he hears how his daughter will be made a bawd, or else,
 before his very eyes, his four sons will be put to a speedy death. his
 agony is like that of one who would rather be dead than alive. again and
 again he bemoans his fate, and weeps aloud and sighs. then my frank and
 gentle lord yvain thus began to speak to him: "sire, very vile and
 impudent is that giant who vaunts himself out there. but may god never
 grant that he should have your daughter in his power! he despises her and
 insults her openly. it would be too great a calamity if so lovely a
 creature of such high birth were handed over to become the sport of boys.
 give me now my arms and horse! have the drawbridge lowered, and let me
 pass. one or the other must be cast down, either i or he, i know not
 which. if i could only humiliate the cruel wretch who is thus oppressing
 you, so that he would release your sons and should come and make amends
 for the insulting words he has spoken to you, then i would commend you to
 god and go about my business." then they go to get his horse, and hand
 over to him his arms, striving so expeditiously that they soon have him
 quite equipped. they delayed as little as they could in arming him. when
 his equipment was complete, there remained nothing but to lower the bridge
 and let him go. they lowered it for him, and he went out. but the lion
 would by no means stay behind. all those who were left behind commended
 the knight to the saviour, for they fear exceedingly lest their devilish
 enemy, who already had slain so many good men on the same field before
 their eyes, would do the same with him. so they pray god to defend him
 from death, and return him to them safe and sound, and that he may give
 him strength to slay the giant. each one softly prays to god in accordance
 with his wish. and the giant fiercely came at him, and with threatening
 words thus spake to him: "by my eyes, the man who sent thee here surely
 had no love for thee! no better way could he have taken to avenge himself
 on thee. he has chosen well his vengeance for whatever wrong thou hast
 done to him." but the other, fearing naught, replies: "thou treatest of
 what matters not. now do thy best, and i'll do mine. idle parley wearies
 me." thereupon my lord yvain, who was anxious to depart, rides at him. he
 goes to strike him on the breast, which was protected by a bear's skin,
 and the giant runs at him with his stake raised in air. my lord yvain
 deals him such a blow upon the chest that he thrusts through the skin and
 wets the tip of his lance in his body's blood by way of sauce. and the
 giant belabours him with the stake, and makes him bend beneath the blows.
 my lord yvain then draws the sword with which he knew how to deal fierce
 blows. he found the giant unprotected, for he trusted in his strength so
 much that he disdained to arm himself. and he who had drawn his blade gave
 him such a slash with the cutting edge, and not with the flat side, that
 he cut from his cheek a slice fit to roast. then the other in turn gave
 him such a blow with the stake that it made him sing in a heap upon his
 horse's neck. thereupon the lion bristles up, ready to lend his master
 aid, and leaps up in his anger and strength, and strikes and tears like so
 much bark the heavy bearskin the giant wore, and he tore away beneath the
 skin a large piece of his thigh, together with the nerves and flesh. the
 giant escaped his clutches, roaring and bellowing like a bull, for the
 lion had badly wounded him. then raising his stake in both hands, he
 thought to strike him, but missed his aim, when the lion leaded backward
 so he missed his blow, and fell exhausted beside my lord yvain, but
 without either of them touching the other. then my lord yvain took aim and
 landed two blows on him. before he could recover himself he had severed
 with the edge of his sword the giant's shoulder from his body. with the
 next blow he ran the whole blade of his sword through his liver beneath
 his chest; the giant falls in death's embrace. and if a great oak tree
 should fall, i think it would make no greater noise than the giant made
 when he tumbled down. all those who were on the wall would fain have
 witnessed such a blow. then it became evident who was the most fleet of
 foot, for all ran to see the game, just like hounds which have followed
 the beast until they finally come up with him. so men and women in rivalry
 ran forward without delay to where the giant lay face downward. the
 daughter comes running, and her mother too. and the four brothers rejoice
 after the woes they have endured. as for my lord yvain they are very sure
 that they could not detain him for any reason they might allege, but they
 beseech him to return and stay to enjoy himself as soon as he shall have
 completed the business which calls him away. and he replies that he cannot
 promise them anything, for as yet he cannot guess whether it will fare
 well or ill with him. but thus much did he say to his host: that he wished
 that his four sons and his daughter should take the dwarf and go to my
 lord gawain when they hear of his return, and should tell and relate to
 him how he has conducted himself. for kind actions are of no use if you
 are not willing that they be known. and they reply: "it is not right that
 such kindness as this should be kept hid: we shall do whatever you desire.
 but tell us what we can say when we come before him. whose praises can we
 speak, when we know not what your name may be?" and he answers them: "when
 you come before him, you may say thus much: that i told you 'the knight
 with the lion' was my name. and at the same time i must beg you to tell
 him from me that, if he does not recognise who i am, yet he knows me well
 and i know him. now i must be gone from here, and the thing which most
 alarms me is that i may too long have tarried here, for before the hour of
 noon be passed i shall have plenty to do elsewhere, if indeed i can arrive
 there in time." then, without further delay, he starts. but first his host
 begged him insistently that he would take with him his four sons: for
 there was none of them who would not strive to serve him, if he would
 allow it. but it did not please or suit him that any one should accompany
 him; so he left the place to them, and went away alone. and as soon as he
 starts, riding as fast as his steed can carry him, he heads toward the
 chapel. the path was good and straight, and he knew well how to keep the
 road. but before he could reach the chapel, the damsel had been dragged
 out and the pyre prepared upon which she was to be placed. clad only in a
 shift, she was held bound before the fire by those who wrongly attributed
 to her an intention she had never had. my lord yvain arrived, and, seeing
 her beside the fire into which she was about to be cast, he was naturally
 incensed. he would be neither courteous nor sensible who had any doubt
 about that fact. so it is true that he was much incensed; but he cherishes
 within himself the hope that god and the right will be on his side. in
 such helpers he confides; nor does he scorn his lion's aid. rushing
 quickly toward the crowd, he shouts: "let the damsel be, you wicked folk!
 having committed no crime, it is not right that she should be cast upon a
 pyre or into a furnace." and they draw off on either side, leaving a
 passage-way for him. but he yearns to see with his own eyes her whom his
 heart beholds in whatever place she may be. his eyes seek her until he
 finds her, while he subdues and holds in check his heart, just as one
 holds in check with a strong curb a horse that pulls. nevertheless, he
 gladly gazes at her, and sighs the while; but he does not sigh so openly
 that his action is detected; rather does he stifle his sighs, though with
 difficulty. and he is seized with pity at hearing, seeing, and perceiving
 the grief of the poor ladies, who cried: "ah, god, how hast thou forgotten
 us! how desolate we shall now remain when we lose so kind a friend, who
 gave us such counsel and such aid, and interceded for us at court! it was
 she who prompted madame to clothe us with her clothes of vair. henceforth
 the situation will change, for there will be no one to speak for us!
 cursed be he who is the cause of our loss! for we shall fare badly in all
 this. there will be no one to utter such advice as this: 'my lady, give
 this vair mantle, this cloak, and this garment to such and such an honest
 dame! truly, such charity will be well employed, for she is in very dire
 need of them.' no such words as these shall be uttered henceforth, for
 there is no one else who is frank and courteous; but every one solicits
 for himself rather than for some one else, even though he have no need."
 (vv. -.) thus they were bemoaning their fate; and my lord yvain
 who was in their midst, heard their complaints, which were neither
 groundless nor assumed. he saw lunete on her knees and stripped to her
 shift, having already made confession, and besought god's mercy for her
 sins. then he who had loved her deeply once came to her and raised her up,
 saying: "my damsel, where are those who blame and accuse you? upon the
 spot, unless they refuse, battle will be offered them." and she, who had
 neither seen nor looked at him before, said: "sire, you come from god in
 this time of my great need! the men who falsely accuse me are all ready
 before me here; if you had been a little later i should soon have been
 reduced to fuel and ashes. you have come here in my defence, and may god
 give you the power to accomplish it in proportion as i am guiltless of the
 accusation which is made against me!" the seneschal and his two brothers
 heard these words. "ah!" they exclaim, "woman, chary of uttering truth but
 generous with lies! he indeed is mad who for thy words assumes so great a
 task. the knight must be simple-minded who has come here to die for thee,
 for he is alone and there are three of us. my advice to him is that he
 turn back before any harm shall come to him." then he replies, as one
 impatient to begin: "whoever is afraid, let him run away! i am not so
 afraid of your three shields that i should go off defeated without a blow.
 i should be indeed discourteous, if, while yet unscathed and in perfect
 case, i should leave the place and field to you. never, so long as i am
 alive and sound, will i run away before such threats. but i advise thee to
 set free the damsel whom thou hast unjustly accused; for she tells me, and
 i believe her word, and she has assured me upon the salvation of her soul,
 that she never committed, or spoke, or conceived any treason against her
 mistress. i believe implicitly what she has told me, and will defend her
 as best i can, for i consider the righteousness of her cause to be in my
 favour. for, if the truth be known, god always sides with the righteous
 cause, for god and the right are one; and if they are both upon my side,
 then i have better company and better aid than thou." 
 then the other responds imprudently that he may make every effort that
 pleases him and is convenient to do him injury, provided that his lion
 shall not do him harm. and he replies that he never brought the lion to
 champion his cause, nor does he wish any but himself to take a hand: but
 if the lion attacks him, let him defend himself against him as best he
 can, for concerning him he will give no guarantee. then the other answers:
 "whatever thou mayst say; unless thou now warn thy lion, and make him
 stand quietly to one side, there is no use of thy longer staying here, but
 begone at once, and so shalt thou be wise; for throughout this country
 every one is aware how this girl betrayed her lady, and it is right that
 she receive her due reward in fire and flame." "may the holy spirit
 forbid!" says he who knows the truth; "may god not let me stir from here
 until i have delivered her!" then he tells the lion to withdraw and to lie
 down quietly, and he does so obediently.
 (vv. -.) the lion now withdrew, and the parley and quarrel being
 ended between them two, they all took their distance for the charge. the
 three together spurred toward him, and he went to meet them at a walk. he
 did not wish to be overturned or hurt at this first encounter. so he let
 them split their lances, while keeping his entire, making for them a
 target of his shield, whereon each one broke his lance. then he galloped
 off until he was separated from them by the space of an acre; but he soon
 returned to the business in hand, having no desire to delay. on his coming
 up the second time, he reached the seneschal before his two brothers, and
 breaking his lance upon his body, he carried him to earth in spite of
 himself, and he gave him such a powerful blow that for a long while he lay
 stunned, incapable of doing him any harm. and then the other two came at
 him with their swords bared, and both deal him great blows, but they
 receive still heavier blows from him. for a single one of the blows he
 deals is more than a match for two of theirs; thus he defends himself so
 well that they have no advantage over him, until the seneschal gets up and
 does his best to injure him, in which attempt the others join, until they
 begin to press him and get the upper hand. then the lion, who is looking
 on, delays no longer to lend him aid; for it seems to him that he needs it
 now. and all the ladies, who are devoted to the damsel, beseech god
 repeatedly and pray to him earnestly not to allow the death or the defeat
 of him who has entered the fray on her account. the ladies, having no
 other weapons, thus assist him with their prayers. and the lion brings him
 such effective aid, that at his first attack, he strikes so fiercely the
 seneschal, who was now on his feet, that he makes the meshes fly from the
 hauberk like straw, and he drags him down with such violence that he tears
 the soft flesh from his shoulder and all down his side. he strips whatever
 he touches, so that the entrails lie exposed. the other two avenge this
 blow.
 (vv. -.) now they are all even on the field. the seneschal is
 marked for death, as he turns and welters in the red stream of warm blood
 pouring from his body. the lion attacks the others; for my lord yvain is
 quite unable, though he did his best by beating or by threatening him, to
 drive him back; but the lion doubtless feels confident that his master
 does not dislike his aid, but rather loves him the more for it: so he
 fiercely attacks them, until they have reason to complain of his blows,
 and they wound him in turn and use him badly. when my lord yvain sees his
 lion wounded, his heart is wroth within his breast, and rightly so; but he
 makes such efforts to avenge him, and presses them so hard, that he
 completely reduces them; they no longer resist him, but surrender to him
 at discretion, because of the lion's help, who is now in great distress;
 for he was wounded everywhere, and had good cause to be in pain. for his
 part, my lord yvain was by no means in a healthy state, for his body bore
 many a wound. but he is not so anxious about himself as about his lion,
 which is in distress. now he has delivered the damsel exactly in
 accordance with his wish, and the lady has very willingly dismissed the
 grudge that she bore her. and those men were burned upon the pyre which
 had been kindled for the damsel's death; for it is right and just that he
 who has misjudged another, should suffer the same manner of death as that
 to which he had condemned the other. now lunete is joyous and glad at
 being reconciled with her mistress, and together they were more happy than
 any one ever was before. without recognising him, all present offered to
 him, who was their lord, their service so long as life should last; even
 the lady, who possessed unknowingly his heart, begged him insistently to
 tarry there until his lion and he had quite recovered. and he replied:
 "lady, i shall not now tarry here until my lady removes from me her
 displeasure and anger: then the end of all my labours will come."
 "indeed," she said, "that grieves me. i think the lady cannot be very
 courteous who cherishes ill-will against you. she ought not to close her
 door against so valorous a knight as you, unless he had done her some
 great wrong." "lady," he replies, "however great the hardship be, i am
 pleased by what ever may be her will. but speak to me no more of that; for
 i shall say nothing of the cause or crime, except to those who are
 informed of it." "does any one know it, then, beside you two?" "yes,
 truly, lady." "well, tell us at least your name, fair sir; then you will
 be free to go." "quite free, my lady? no, i shall not be free. i owe more
 than i can pay. yet, i ought not to conceal from you my name. you will
 never hear of 'the knight with the lion' without hearing of me; for i wish
 to be known by that name." "for god's sake, sir, what does that name mean?
 for we never saw you before, nor have we ever heard mentioned this name of
 yours." "my lady, you may from that infer that my fame is not widespread."
 then the lady says: "once more, if it did not oppose your will, i would
 pray you to tarry here." "really, my lady, i should not dare, until i knew
 certainly that i had regained my lady's good-will." "well, then, go in
 god's name, fair sir; and, if it be his will, may he convert your grief
 and sorrow into joy." "lady," says he, "may god hear your prayer." then he
 added softly under his breath: "lady, it is you who hold the key, and,
 though you know it not, you hold the casket in which my happiness is kept
 under lock."
 (vv. -.) then he goes away in great distress, and there is no one
 who recognises him save lunete, who accompanied him a long distance.
 lunete alone keeps him company, and he begs her insistently never to
 reveal the name of her champion. "sire," says she, "i will never do so."
 then he further requested her that she should not forget him, and that she
 should keep a place for him in his mistress' heart, whenever the chance
 arose. she tells him to be at ease on that score; for she will never be
 forgetful, nor unfaithful, nor idle. then he thanks her a thousand times,
 and he departs pensive and oppressed, because of his lion that he must
 needs carry, being unable to follow him on foot. he makes for him a litter
 of moss and ferns in his shield. when he has made a bed for him there, he
 lays him in it as gently as he can, and carries him thus stretched out
 full length on the inner side of his shield. thus, in his shield he bears
 him off, until he arrives before the gate of a mansion, strong and fair.
 finding it closed, he called, and the porter opened it so promptly that he
 had no need to call but once. he reaches out to take his rein, and greets
 him thus: "come in, fair sire. i offer you the dwelling of my lord, if it
 please you to dismount." "i accept the offer gladly," he replies, "for i
 stand in great need of it, and it is time to find a lodging."
 (vv. -.) thereupon, he passed through the gate, and saw the
 retainers in a mass coming to meet him. they greeted him and helped him
 from his horse, and laid down upon the pavement his shield with the lion
 on it. and some, taking his horse, put it in a stable: while others very
 properly relieved him of his arms and took them. then the lord of the
 castle heard the news, and at once came down into the courtyard, and
 greeted him. and his lady came down, too, with all her sons and daughters
 and a great crowd of other people, who all rejoiced to offer him a
 lodging. they gave him a quiet room, because they deemed that he was sick;
 but their good nature was put to a test when they allowed the lion to go
 with him. his cure was undertaken by two maidens skilled in surgery, who
 were daughters of the lord. i do not know how many days he stayed there,
 until he and his lion, being cured, were compelled to proceed upon their
 way.
 (vv. -.) but within this time it came about that my lord of noire
 espine had a struggle with death, and so fierce was death's attack that he
 was forced to die. after his death it happened that the elder of two
 daughters whom he had, announced that she would possess uncontested all
 the estates for herself during her entire lifetime, and that she would
 give no share to her sister. and the other one said that she would go to
 king arthur's court to seek help for the defence of her claim to the land.
 when the former saw that her sister would by no means concede all the
 estates to her without contest, she was greatly concerned, and thought
 that, if possible, she would get to court before her. at once she prepared
 and equipped herself, and without any tarrying or delay, she proceeded to
 the court. the other followed her, and made all the haste she could; but
 her journey was all in vain, for her eider sister had already presented
 her case to my lord gawain, and he had promised to execute her will. but
 there was an agreement between them that if any one should learn of the
 facts from her, he would never again take arms for her, and to this
 arrangement she gave consent.
 (vv. -.) just then the other sister arrived at court, clad in a
 short mantle of scarlet cloth and fresh ermine. it happened to be the
 third day after the queen had returned from the captivity in which
 maleagant had detained her with all the other prisoners; but lancelot had
 remained behind, treacherously confined within a tower. and on that very
 day, when the damsel came to court, news was received of the cruel and
 wicked giant whom the knight with the lion had killed in battle. in his
 name, my lord gawain was greeted by his nephews and niece, who told him in
 detail of all the great service and great deeds of prowess he had done for
 them for his sake, and how that he was well acquainted with him, though
 not aware of his identity.
 (vv. -.) all this was heard by her, who was plunged thereby into
 great despair and sorrow and dejection; for, since the best of the knights
 was absent, she thought she would find no aid or counsel at the court. she
 had already made several loving and insistent appeals to my lord gawain;
 but he had said to her: "my dear, it is useless to appeal to me; i cannot
 do it; i have another affair on hand, which i shall in no wise give up."
 then the damsel at once left him, and presented herself before the king.
 "o king," said she, "i have come to thee and to thy court for aid. but i
 find none, and i am very much mazed that i can get no counsel here. yet it
 would not be right for me to go away without taking leave. my sister may
 know, however, that she might obtain by kindness whatever she desired of
 my property; but i will never surrender my heritage to her by force, if i
 can help it, and if i can find any aid or counsel." "you have spoken
 wisely," said the king; "since she is present here, i advise, recommend,
 and urge her to surrender to you what is your right." then the other, who
 was confident of the best knight in the world, replied: "sire, may god
 confound me, if ever i bestow on her from my estates any castle, town,
 clearing, forest, land, or anything else. but if any knight dares to take
 arms on her behalf and desires to defend her cause, let him step forth at
 once." "your offer to her is not fair; she needs more time," the king
 replied; "if she desires, she may have forty days to secure a champion,
 according to the practice of all courts." to which the elder sister
 replied: "fair king, my lord, you may establish your laws as it pleases
 you, and as seems good, nor is it my place to gainsay you, so i must
 consent to the postponement, if she desires it." whereupon, the other says
 that she does desire it, and she makes formal request for it. then she
 commended the king to god, and left the court resolving to devote her life
 to the search through all the land for the knight with the lion, who
 devotes himself to succouring women in need of aid.
 (vv. -.) thus she entered upon her quest, and traversed many a
 country without hearing any news of him, which caused her such grief that
 she fell sick. but it was well for her that it happened so; for she came
 to the dwelling of a friend of hers, by whom she was dearly loved. by this
 time her face showed clearly that she was not in good health. they
 insisted upon detaining her until she told them of her plight; whereupon,
 another damsel took up the quest wherein she had been engaged, and
 continued the search on her behalf. so while the one remained in this
 retreat, the other rode rapidly all day long, until the darkness of night
 came on, and caused her great anxiety.  and her
 trouble was doubled when the rain came on with terrible violence, as if
 god himself were doing his worst, while she was in the depths of the
 forest. the night and the woods cause her great distress, but she is more
 tormented by the rain than by either the woods or the night. and the road
 was so bad that her horse was often up to the girth in mud; any damsel
 might well be terrified to be in the woods, without escort, in such bad
 weather and in such darkness that she could not see the horse she was
 riding. so she called on god first, and his mother next, and then on all
 the saints in turn, and offered up many a prayer that god would lead her
 out from this forest and conduct her to some lodging-place. she continued
 in prayer until she heard a horn, at which she greatly rejoiced; for she
 thought now she would find shelter, if she could only reach the place. so
 she turned in the direction of the sound, and came upon a paved road which
 led straight toward the horn whose sound she heard; for the horn had given
 three long, loud blasts. and she made her way straight toward the sound,
 until she came to a cross which stood on the right side of the road, and
 there she thought that she might find the horn and the person who had
 sounded it. so she spurred her horse in that direction, until she drew
 near a bridge, and descried the white walls and the barbican of a circular
 castle. thus, by chance she came upon the castle, setting her course by
 the sound which had led her thither. she had been attracted by the sound
 of the horn blown by a watchman upon the walls. as soon as the watchman
 caught sight of her, he called to her, then came down, and taking the key
 of the gate, opened it for her and said: "welcome, damsel, whoe'er you be.
 you shall be well lodged this night." "i have no other desire than that,"
 the damsel replied, as he let her in. after the toil and anxiety she had
 endured that day, she was fortunate to find such a lodging-place; for she
 was very comfortable there. after the meal the host addressed her, and
 inquired where she was going and what was her quest. whereupon, she thus
 replied: "i am seeking one whom i never saw, so far as i am aware, and
 never knew; but he has a lion with him, and i am told that, if i find him,
 i can place great confidence in him." "i can testify to that," the other
 said: "for the day before yesterday god sent him here to me in my dire
 need. blessed be the paths which led him to my dwelling. for he made me
 glad by avenging me of a mortal enemy and killing him before my eyes.
 outside yonder gate you may see to-morrow the body of a mighty giant, whom
 he slew with such ease that he hardly had to sweat." "for god's sake,
 sire," the damsel said, "tell me now the truth, if you know whither he
 went, and where he is." "i don't know," he said, "as god sees me here; but
 to-morrow i will start you on the road by which he went away from here."
 "and may god," said she, "lead me where i may hear true news of him. for
 if i find him, i shall be very glad."
 (vv. -.) thus they continued in long converse until at last they
 went to bed. when the day dawned, the maid arose, being in great concern
 to find the object of her quest. and the master of the house arose with
 all his companions, and set her upon the road which led straight to the
 spring beneath the pine. and she, hastening on her way toward the town,
 came and asked the first men whom she met, if they could tell her where
 she would find the lion and the knight who travelled in company. and they
 told her that they had seen him defeat three knights in that very place.
 whereupon, she said at once: "for god's sake, since you have said so much,
 do not keep back from me anything that you can add." "no," they replied;
 "we know nothing more than we have said, nor do we know what became of
 him. if she for whose sake he came here, cannot give you further news,
 there will be no one here to enlighten you. you will not have far to go,
 if you wish to speak with her; for she has gone to make prayer to god and
 to hear mass in yonder church, and judging by the time she has been
 inside, her orisons have been prolonged."
 (vv. -.) while they were talking thus, lunete came out from the
 church, and they said: "there she is." then she went to meet her, and they
 greeted each other. she asked lunete at once for the information she
 desired; and lunete said that she would have a palfrey saddled; for she
 wished to accompany her, and would take her to an enclosure where she had
 left him. the other maiden thanked her heartily. lunete mounts the palfrey
 which is brought without delay, and, as they ride, she tells her how she
 had been accused and charged with treason, and how the pyre was already
 kindled upon which she was to be laid, and how he had come to help her in
 just the moment of her need. while speaking thus, she escorted her to the
 road which led directly to the spot where my lord yvain had parted from
 her. when she had accompanied her thus far, she said: "follow this road
 until you come to a place where, if it please god and the holy spirit, you
 will hear more reliable news of him than i can tell. i very well remember
 that i left him either near here, or exactly here, where we are now; we
 have not seen each other since then, and i do not know what he has done.
 when he left me, he was in sore need of a plaster for his wounds. so i
 will send you along after him, and if it be god's will, may he grant that
 you find him to-night or to-morrow in good health. now go: i commend you
 to god. i must not follow you any farther, lest my mistress be displeased
 with me." then lunete leaves her and turns back; while the other pushed on
 until she found a house, where my lord yvain had tarried until he was
 restored to health. she saw people gathered before the gate, knights,
 ladies and men-at-arms, and the master of the house; she saluted them, and
 asked them to tell her, if possible, news of a knight for whom she sought.
 "who is he?" they ask. "i have heard it said that he is never without a
 lion." "upon my word, damsel," the master says, "he has just now left us.
 you can come up with him to-night, if you are able to keep his tracks in
 sight, and are careful not to lose any time." "sire," she answers, "god
 forbid. but tell me now in what direction i must follow him." and they
 tell her: "this way, straight ahead," and they beg her to greet him on
 their behalf. but their courtesy was not of much avail; for, without
 giving any heed, she galloped off at once. the pace seemed much too slow
 to her, though her palfrey made good time. so she galloped through the mud
 just the same as where the road was good and smooth, until she caught
 sight of him with the lion as his companion. then in her gladness she
 exclaims: "god, help me now. at last i see him whom i have so long
 pursued, and whose trace i have long followed. but if i pursue and nothing
 gain, what will it profit me to come up with him? little or nothing, upon
 my word. if he does not join in my enterprise, i have wasted all my
 pains." thus saying, she pressed on so fast that her palfrey was all in a
 sweat; but she caught up with him and saluted him. he thus at once replied
 to her: "god save you, fair one, and deliver you from grief and woe." "the
 same to you, sire, who, i hope, will soon be able to deliver me." then she
 draws nearer to him, and says: "sire, i have long searched for you. the
 great fame of your merit has made me traverse many a county in my weary
 search for you. but i continued my quest so long, thank god, that at last
 i have found you here. and if i brought any anxiety with me, i am no
 longer concerned about it, nor do i complain or remember it now. i am
 entirely relieved; my worry has taken flight the moment i met with you.
 moreover, the affair is none of mine: i come to you from one that is
 better than i, a woman who is more noble and excellent. but if she be
 disappointed in her hopes of you, then she has been betrayed by your fair
 renown, for she has no expectation of other aid. my damsel, who is
 deprived of her inheritance by a sister, expects with your help to win her
 suit; she will have none but you defend her cause. no one can make her
 believe that any one else could bear her aid. by securing her share of the
 heritage, you will have won and acquired the love of her who is now
 disinherited, and you will also increase your own renown. she herself was
 going in search for you to secure the boon for which she hoped; no one
 else would have taken her place, had she not been detained by an illness
 which compels her to keep her bed. now tell me, please, whether you will
 dare to come, or whether you will decline." "no," he says; "no man can win
 praise in a life of ease; and i will not hold back, but will follow you
 gladly, my sweet friend, whithersoever it may please you. and if she for
 whose sake you have sought me out stands in some great need of me, have no
 fear that i shall not do all i can for her. now may god grant me the
 happiness and grace to settle in her favour her rightful claim."
 (vv. -.)  thus conversing, they two rode
 away until they approached the town of pesme avanture. they had no desire
 to pass it by, for the day was already drawing to a close. they came
 riding to the castle, when all the people, seeing them approach, called
 out to the knight: "ill come, sire, ill come. this lodging-place was
 pointed out to you in order that you might suffer harm and shame. an abbot
 might take his oath to that." "ah," he replied, "foolish and vulgar folk,
 full of all mischief, and devoid of honour, why have you thus assailed
 me?" "why? you will find out soon enough, if you will go a little farther.
 but you shall learn nothing more until you have ascended to the fortress."
 at once my lord yvain turns toward the tower, and the crowd cries out, all
 shouting aloud at him: "eh, eh, wretch, whither goest thou? if ever in thy
 life thou hast encountered one who worked thee shame and woe, such will be
 done thee there, whither thou art going, as will never be told again by
 thee." my lord yvain, who is listening, says: "base and pitiless people,
 miserable and impudent, why do you assail me thus, why do you attack me
 so? what do you wish of me, what do you want, that you growl this way
 after me?" a lady, who was somewhat advanced in years, who was courteous
 and sensible, said: "thou hast no cause to be enraged: they mean no harm
 in what they say; but, if thou understoodest them aright, they are warning
 thee not to spend the night up there; they dare not tell thee the reason
 for this, but they are warning and blaming thee because they wish to
 arouse thy fears. this they are accustomed to do in the case of all who
 come, so that they may not go inside. and the custom is such that we dare
 not receive in our own houses, for any reason whatsoever, any gentleman
 who comes here from a distance. the responsibility now is thine alone; no
 one will stand in thy way. if thou wishest, thou mayst go up now; but my
 advice is to turn back again." "lady," he says, "doubtless it would be to
 my honour and advantage to follow your advice; but i do not know where i
 should find a lodging-place to-night." "upon my word," says she, "i'll say
 no more, for the concern is none of mine. go wherever you please.
 nevertheless, i should be very glad to see you return from inside without
 too great shame; but that could hardly be." "lady," he says, "may god
 reward you for the wish. however, my wayward heart leads me on inside, and
 i shall do what my heart desires." thereupon, he approaches the gate,
 accompanied by his lion and his damsel. then the porter calls to him, and
 says: "come quickly, come. you are on your way to a place where you will
 be securely detained, and may your visit be accursed."
 (vv. -.) the porter, after addressing him with this very
 ungracious welcome, hurried upstairs. but my lord yvain, without making
 reply, passed straight on, and found a new and lofty hall; in front of it
 there was a yard enclosed with large, round, pointed stakes, and seated
 inside the stakes he saw as many as three hundred maidens, working at
 different kinds of embroidery. each one was sewing with golden thread and
 silk, as best she could. but such was their poverty, that many of them
 wore no girdle, and looked slovenly, because so poor; and their garments
 were torn about their breasts and at the elbows, and their shifts were
 soiled about their necks. their necks were thin, and their faces pale with
 hunger and privation. they see him, as he looks at them, and they weep,
 and are unable for some time to do anything or to raise their eyes from
 the ground, so bowed down they are with woe. when he had contemplated them
 for a while, my lord yvain turned about and moved toward the door; but the
 porter barred the way, and cried: "it is no use, fair master; you shall
 not get out now. you would like to be outside: but, by my head, it is of
 no use. before you escape you will have suffered such great shame that you
 could not easily suffer more; so you were not wise to enter here, for
 there is no question of escaping now." "nor do i wish to do so, fair
 brother," said he; "but tell me, by thy father's soul, whence came the
 damsels whom i saw in the yard, weaving cloths of silk and gold. i enjoy
 seeing the work they do, but i am much distressed to see their bodies so
 thin, and their faces so pale and sad. i imagine they would be fair and
 charming, if they had what they desire." "i will tell you nothing," was
 the reply; "seek some one else to tell you." "that will i do, since there
 is no better way." then he searches until he finds the entrance of the
 yard where the damsels were at work: and coming before them, he greets
 them all, and sees tears flowing from their eyes, as they weep. then he
 says to them: "may it please god to remove from your hearts, and turn to
 joy, this grief, the cause of which i do not know." one of them answers:
 "may you be heard by god, to whom you have addressed your prayer. it shall
 not be concealed from you who we are, and from what land: i suppose that
 is what you wish to know." "for no other purpose came i here," says he. 
 "sire, it happened a long while ago that the king of the isle of damsels
 went seeking news through divers courts and countries, and he kept on his
 travels like a dunce until he encountered this perilous place. it was an
 unlucky hour when he first came here, for we wretched captives who are
 here receive all the shame and misery which we have in no wise deserved.
 and rest assured that you yourself may expect great shame, unless a ransom
 for you be accepted. but, at any rate, so it came about that my lord came
 to this town, where there are two sons of the devil (do not take it as a
 jest) who were born of a woman and an imp. these two were about to fight
 with the king, whose terror was great, for he was not yet eighteen years
 old, and they would have been able to cleave him through like a tender
 lamb. so the king, in his terror, escaped his fate as best he could, by
 swearing that he would send hither each year, as required, thirty of his
 damsels, and with this rent he freed himself. and when he swore, it was
 agreed that this arrangement should remain in force as long as the two
 devils lived. but upon the day when they should be conquered and defeated
 in battle, he would be relieved from this tribute, and we should be
 delivered who are now shamefully given over to distress and misery. never
 again shall we know what pleasure is. but i spoke folly just now in
 referring to our deliverance, for we shall never more leave this place. we
 shall spend our days weaving cloths of silk, without ever being better
 clad. we shall always be poor and naked, and shall always suffer from
 hunger and thirst, for we shall never be able to earn enough to procure
 for ourselves any better food. our bread supply is very scarce—a
 little in the morning and less at night, for none of us can gain by her
 handiwork more than fourpence a day for her daily bread. and with this we
 cannot provide ourselves with sufficient food and clothes. for though
 there is not one of us who does not earn as much as twenty sous 
 a week, yet we cannot live without hardship. now you must know that there
 is not a single one of us who does not do twenty sous worth of work or
 more, and with such a sum even a duke would be considered rich. so while
 we are reduced to such poverty, he, for whom we work, is rich with the
 product of our toil. we sit up many nights, as well as every day, to earn
 the more, for they threaten to do us injury, when we seek some rest, so we
 do not dare to rest ourselves. but why should i tell you more? we are so
 shamefully treated and insulted that i cannot tell you the fifth part of
 it all. but what makes us almost wild with rage is that we very often see
 rich and excellent knights, who fight with the two devils, lose their
 lives on our account. they pay dearly for the lodging they receive, as you
 will do to-morrow. for, whether you wish to do so or not, you will have to
 fight singlehanded and lose your fair renown with these two devils." "may
 god, the true and spiritual, protect me," said my lord yvain, "and give
 you back your honour and happiness, if it be his will. i must go now and
 see the people inside there, and find out what sort of entertainment they
 will offer me." "go now, sire, and may he protect you who gives and
 distributes all good things."
 (vv. -.) then he went until he came to the hall where he found no
 one, good or bad, to address him. then he and his companion passed through
 the house until they came to a garden. they never spoke of, or mentioned,
 stabling their horses. but what matters it? for those who considered them
 already as their own had stabled them carefully. i do not know whether
 their expectation was wise, for the horses' owners are still perfectly
 hale. the horses, however, have oats and hay, and stand in litter up to
 their belly. my lord yvain and his company enter the garden. there he
 sees, reclining upon his elbow upon a silken rug, a gentleman, to whom a
 maiden was reading from a romance about i know not whom. there had come to
 recline there with them and listen to the romance a lady, who was the
 mother of the damsel, as the gentleman was her father; they had good
 reason to enjoy seeing and hearing her, for they had no other children.
 she was not yet sixteen years old, and was so fair and full of grace that
 the god of love would have devoted himself entirely to her service, if he
 had seen her, and would never have made her fall in love with anybody
 except himself. for her sake he would have become a man, and would lay
 aside his deity, and would smite his own body with that dart whose wound
 never heals unless some base physician attends to it. it is not fitting
 that any one should recover until he meets with faithlessness. any one who
 is cured by other means is not honestly in love. i could tell you so much
 about this wound, if you were pleased to listen to it, that i would not
 get through my tale to-day. but there would be some one who would promptly
 say that i was telling you but an idle tale; for people don't fall in love
 nowadays, nor do they love as they used to do, so they do not care to hear
 of it. 
 but hear now in what fashion and with what manner of hospitality my lord
 yvain was received. all those who were in the garden leaped to their feet
 when they saw him come, and cried out: "this way, fair sire. may you and
 all you love be blessed with all that god can do or say." i know not if
 they were deceiving him, but they receive him joyfully and act as if they
 are pleased that he should be comfortably lodged. even the lord's daughter
 serves him very honourably, as one should treat a worthy guest. she
 relieves him of all his arms, nor was it the least attention she bestowed
 on him when she herself washed his neck and face. the lord wishes that all
 honour should be shown him, as indeed they do. she gets out from her
 wardrobe a folded shirt, white drawers, needle and thread for his sleeves,
 which she sews on, thus clothing him.  may god
 want now that this attention and service may not prove too costly to him!
 she gave him a handsome jacket to put on over his shirt, and about his
 neck she placed a brand new spotted mantle of scarlet stuff. she takes
 such pains to serve him well that he feels ashamed and embarrassed. but
 the damsel is so courteous and open-hearted and polite that she feels she
 is doing very little. and she knows well that it is her mother's will that
 she shall leave nothing undone for him which she thinks may win his
 gratitude. that night at table he was so well served with so many dishes
 that there were too many. the servants who brought in the dishes might
 well have been wearied by serving them. that night they did him all manner
 of honour, putting him comfortably to bed, and not once going near him
 again after he had retired. his lion lay at his feet, as his custom was.
 in the morning, when god lighted his great light for the world, as early
 as was consistent in one who was always considerate, my lord yvain quickly
 arose, as did his damsel too. they heard mass in a chapel, where it was
 promptly said for them in honour of the holy spirit.
 (vv. -.) after the mass my lord yvain heard bad news, when he
 thought the time had come for him to leave and that nothing would stand in
 his way; but it could not be in accordance with his wish. when he said:
 "sire, if it be your will, and with your permission, i am going now," the
 master of the house replied: "friend, i will not grant you permission yet.
 there is a reason why i cannot do so, for there is established in this
 castle a very terrible practice which i am bound to observe. i shall now
 cause to approach two great, strong fellows of mine, against whom, whether
 right or wrong, you must take arms. if you can defend yourself against
 them, and conquer and slay them both, my daughter desires you as her lord,
 and the suzerainty of this town and all its dependencies awaits you."
 "sire," said he, "for all this i have no desire. so may god never bestow
 your daughter upon me, but may she remain with you; for she is so fair and
 so elegant that the emperor of germany would be fortunate to win her as
 his wife." "no more, fair guest," the lord replied: "there is no need of
 my listening to your refusal, for you cannot escape. he who can defeat the
 two, who are about to attack you, must by right receive my castle, and all
 my land, and my daughter as his wife. there is no way of avoiding or
 renouncing the battle. but i feel sure that your refusal of my daughter is
 due to cowardice, for you think that in this manner you can completely
 avoid the battle. know, however, without fail that you must surely fight.
 no knight who lodges here can possibly escape. this is a settled custom
 and statute, which will endure yet for many a year, for my daughter will
 never be married until i see them dead or defeated." "then i must fight
 them in spite of myself. but i assure you that i should very gladly give
 it up. in spite of my reluctance, however, i shall accept the battle,
 since it is inevitable." thereupon, the two hideous, black sons of the
 devil come in, both armed with a crooked club of a cornelian cherry-tree,
 which they had covered with copper and wound with brass. they were armed
 from the shoulders to the knees, but their head and face were bare, as
 well as their brawny legs. thus armed, they advanced, bearing in their
 hands round shields, stout and light for fighting. the lion begins to
 quiver as soon as he sees them, for he sees the arms they have, and
 perceives that they come to fight his master. he is aroused, and bristles
 up at once, and, trembling with rage and bold impulse, he thrashes the
 earth with his tail, desiring to rescue his master before they kill him.
 and when they see him they say: "vassal, remove the lion from here that he
 may not do us harm. either surrender to us at once, or else, we adjure
 you, that lion must be put where he can take no part in aiding you or in
 harming us. you must come alone to enjoy our sport, for the lion would
 gladly help you, if he could." my lord yvain then replies to them: "take
 him away yourselves if you are afraid of him. for i shall be well pleased
 and satisfied if he can contrive to injure you, and i shall be grateful
 for his aid." they answer: "upon my word that will not do; you shall never
 receive any help from him. do the best you can alone, without the help of
 any one. you must fight single-handed against us two. if you were not
 alone, it would be two against two; so you must follow our orders, and
 remove your lion from here at once, however much you may dislike to do
 so." "where do you wish him to be?" he asks, "or where do you wish me to
 put him?" then they show him a small room, and say: "shut him up in
 there." "it shall be done, since it is your will." then he takes him and
 shuts him up. and now they bring him arms for his body, and lead out his
 horse, which they give to him, and he mounts. the two champions, being now
 assured about the lion, which is shut up in the room, come at him to
 injure him and do him harm. they give him such blows with the maces that
 his shield and helmet are of little use, for when they hit him on the
 helmet they batter it in and break it; and the shield is broken and
 dissolved like ice, for they make such holes in it that one could thrust
 his fists through it: their onslaught is truly terrible. and he—what
 does he do against these two devils? urged on by shame and fear, he
 defends himself with all his strength. he strains every nerve, and exerts
 himself to deal heavy, and telling blows; they lost nothing by his gifts,
 for he returned their attentions with double measure. in his room, the
 lion's heart is heavy and sad, for he remembers the kind deed done for him
 by this noble man, who now must stand in great need of his service and
 aid. if now he could escape from there, he would return him the kindness
 with full measure and full bushel, without any discount whatsoever. he
 looks about in all directions, but sees no way of escape. he hears the
 blows of the dangerous and desperate fight, and in his grief he rages and
 is beside himself. he investigates, until he comes to the threshold, which
 was beginning to grow rotten; and he scratches at it until he can squeeze
 himself in as far as his haunches, when he sticks fast. meanwhile, my lord
 yvain was hard pressed and sweating freely, for he found that the two
 fellows were very strong, fierce, and persistent. he had received many a
 blow, and repaid it as best he could, but without doing them any harm, for
 they were well skilled in fencing, and their shields were not of a kind to
 be hacked by any sword, however sharp and well tempered it might be. so my
 lord yvain had good reason to fear his death, yet he managed to hold his
 own until the lion extricated himself by continued scratching beneath the
 threshold. if the rascals are not killed now, surely they will never be.
 for so long as the lion knows them to be alive, they can never obtain
 truce or peace with him. he seizes one of them, and pulls him down to
 earth like a tree-trunk. the wretches are terrified, and there is not a
 man present who does not rejoice. for he whom the lion has dragged down
 will never be able to rise again, unless the other succours him. he runs
 up to bring him aid, and at the same time to protect himself, lest the
 lion should attack him as soon as he had despatched the one whom he had
 thrown down; he was more afraid of the lion than of his master. but my
 lord yvain will be foolish now if he allows him longer life, when he sees
 him turn his back, and sees his neck bare and exposed; this chance turned
 out well for him. when the rascal exposed to him his bare head and neck,
 he dealt him such a blow that he smote his head from his shoulders so
 quietly that the fellow never knew a word about it. then he dismounts,
 wishing to help and save the other one from the lion, who holds him fast.
 but it is of no use, for already he is in such straits that a physician
 can never arrive in time; for the lion, coming at him furiously, so
 wounded him at the first attack, that he was in a dreadful state.
 nevertheless, he drags the lion back, and sees that he had torn his
 shoulder from its place. he is in no fear of the fellow now, for his club
 has fallen from his hand, and he lies like a dead man without action or
 movement; still he has enough strength to speak, and he said as clearly as
 he could: "please take your lion away, fair sire, that he may not do me
 further harm. henceforth you may do with me whatever may be your desire.
 whoever begs and prays for mercy, ought not to have his prayer refused,
 unless he addresses a heartless man. i will no longer defend myself, nor
 will i ever get up from here with my own strength; so i put myself in your
 hands." "speak out then," he says, "if thou dost admit that thou art
 conquered and defeated." "sire," he says, "it is evident. i am defeated in
 spite of myself, and i surrender, i promise you." "then thou needest have
 no further fear of me, and my lion will leave thee alone." then he is
 surrounded by all the crowd, who arrive on the scene in haste. and both
 the lord and his lady rejoice over him, and embrace him, and speak to him
 of their daughter, saying: "now you will be the lord and master of us all,
 and our daughter will be your wife, for we bestow her upon you as your
 spouse." "and for my part," he says. "i restore her to you. let him who
 has her keep her. i have no concern with her, though i say it not in
 disparagement. take it not amiss if i do not accept her, for i cannot and
 must not do so. but deliver to me now, if you will, the wretched maidens
 in your possession. the agreement, as you well know, is that they shall
 all go free." "what you say is true," he says: "and i resign and deliver
 them freely to you: there will be no dispute on that score. but you will
 be wise to take my daughter with all my wealth, for she is fair, and
 charming, and sensible. you will never find again such a rich marriage as
 this." "sire," he replies, "you do not know of my engagements and my
 affairs, and i do not dare to explain them to you. but, you may be sure,
 when i refuse what would never be refused by any one who was free to
 devote his heart and intentions to such a fair and charming girl, that i
 too would willingly accept her hand if i could, or if i were free to
 accept her or any other maid. but i assure you that i cannot do it: so let
 me depart in peace. for the damsel, who escorted me hither, is awaiting
 me. she has kept me company, and i would not willingly desert her whatever
 the future may have in store." "you wish to go, fair sire? but how? my
 gate will never be opened for you unless my judgment bids me give the
 command; rather shall you remain here as my prisoner. you are acting
 haughtily and making a mistake when you disdain to take my daughter at my
 request." "disdain, my lord? upon my soul, i do not disdain her. whatever
 the penalty may be, i cannot marry a wife or tarry here. i shall follow
 the damsel who is my guide: for otherwise it cannot be. but, with your
 consent, i will pledge you my right hand, and you may take my word, that,
 just as you see me now, i will return if possible, and then will accept
 your daughter's hand, whenever it may seem good ro you." "confound any
 one," he says, "who asks you for your word or promise or pledge. if my
 daughter pleases you, you will return quickly enough. you will not return
 any sooner. i think, for having given your word or sworn an oath. begone
 now. i release you from all oaths and promises. if you are detained by
 rain or wind, or by nothing at all, it is of no consequence to me. i do
 not hold my daughter so cheap as to bestow her upon you forcibly. now go
 about your business. for it is quite the same to me whether you go or
 whether you stay."
 (vv. -.) thereupon my lord yvain turns away and delays no longer
 in the castle. he escorted the poor and ill-clad wretches, who were now
 released from captivity, and whom the lord committed to his care. these
 maidens feel that now they are rich, as they file out in pairs before him
 from the castle. i do not believe that they would rejoice so much as they
 do now were he who created the whole world to descend to earth from
 heaven. now all those people who had insulted him in every possible way
 come to beseech him for mercy and peace, and escort him on his way. he
 replies that he knows nothing of what they mean. "i do not understand what
 you mean," he says; "but i have nothing against you. i do not remember
 that you ever said anything that harmed me." they are very glad for what
 they hear, and loudly praise his courtesy, and after escorting him a long
 distance, they all commend him to god. then the damsels, after asking his
 permission, separated from him. when they left him, they all bowed to him,
 and prayed and expressed the wish that god might grant him joy and health,
 and the accomplishment of his desire, wherever in the future he should go.
 then he, who is anxious to be gone, says that he hopes god will save them
 all. "go," he says, "and may god conduct you into your countries safe and
 happy." then they continue their way joyfully; and my lord yvain departs
 in the other direction. all the days of that week he never ceases to hurry
 on under the escort of the maid, who was well acquainted with the road,
 and with the retired place where she had left the unhappy and disconsolate
 damsel who had been deprived of her inheritance. but when she heard news
 of the arrival of the maiden and of the knight with the lion. there never
 was such joy as she felt within her heart. for now she thinks that, if she
 insists, her sister will cede her a part of her inheritance. the damsel
 had long lain sick, and had just recovered from her malady. it had
 seriously affected her, as was apparent from her face. straightway she
 went forth to meet them, greeting them and honouring them in every way she
 could. there is no need to speak of the happiness that prevailed that
 night in the house. no mention will be made of it, for the story would be
 too long to tell. i pass over all that, until they mounted next morning
 and went away. they rode until they saw the town where king arthur had
 been staying for a fortnight or more. and there, too, was the damsel who
 had deprived her sister of her heritage, for she had kept close to the
 court, waiting for the arrival of her sister, who now draws near. but she
 does not worry much, for she does not think that her sister can find any
 knight who can withstand my lord gawain's attack, and only one day of the
 forty yet remains. if this single day had passed, she would have had the
 reasonable and legal right to claim the heritage for herself alone. but
 more stands in the way than she thinks or believes. that night they spent
 outside the town in a small and humble house, where, in accordance with
 their desire, they were not recognised. at the first sign of dawn the next
 morning they necessarily issue forth, but ensconce themselves in hiding
 until broad daylight.
 (vv. -.) i know not how many days had passed since my lord gawain
 had so completely disappeared that no one at court knew anything about
 him, except only the damsel in whose cause he was to fight. he had
 concealed himself three or four leagues from the court, and when he
 returned he was so equipped that even those who knew him perfectly could
 not recognise him by the arms he bore. the damsel, whose injustice toward
 her sister was evident, presented him at court in the sight of all, for
 she intended with his help to triumph in the dispute where she had no
 rights. so she said to the king: "my lord, time passes. the noon hour will
 soon be gone, and this is the last day. as you see, i am prepared to
 defend my claim. if my sister were going to return, there would be nothing
 to do but await her arrival. but i may praise god that she is not coming
 back again. it is evident that she cannot better her affairs, and that her
 trouble has been for naught. for my part, i have been ready all the time
 up to this last day, to prove my claim to what is mine. i have proved my
 point entirely without a fight, and now i may rightfully go to accept my
 heritage in peace; for i shall render no accounting for it to my sister as
 long as i live, and she will lead a wretched and miserable existence."
 then the king, who well knew that the damsel was disloyally unjust toward
 her sister, said to her: "my dear, upon my word, in a royal court one must
 wait as long as the king's justice sits and deliberates upon the verdict.
 it is not yet time to pack up, for it is my belief that your sister will
 yet arrive in time." before the king had finished, he saw the knight with
 the lion and the damsel with him. they two were advancing alone, having
 slipped away from the lion, who had stayed where they spent the night.
 (vv. -.) the king saw the damsel whom he did not fail to
 recognise, and he was greatly pleased and delighted to see her, for he was
 on her side of the quarrel, because he had regard for what was right.
 joyfully he cried out to her as soon as he could: "come forward, fair one:
 may god save you!" when the other sister hears these words, she turns
 trembling, and sees her with the knight whom she had brought to defend in
 her claim: then she turned blacker than the earth. the damsel, after being
 kindly welcomed by all, went to where the king was sitting. when she had
 come before him, she spoke to him thus: "god save the king and his
 household. if my rights in this dispute can be settled by a champion, then
 it will be done by this knight who has followed me hither. this frank and
 courteous knight had many other things to do elsewhere; but he felt such
 pity for me that he cast aside all his other affairs for the sake of mine.
 now, madame, my very dear sister, whom i love as much as my own heart,
 would do the right and courteous thing if she would let me have so much of
 what is mine by right that there might be peace between me and her; for i
 ask for nothing that is hers." "nor do i ask for anything that is thine,"
 the other replied; "for thou hast nothing, and nothing shalt thou have.
 thou canst never talk so much as to gain anything by thy words. thou
 mayest dry up with grief." then the other, who was very polite and
 sensible and courteous, replied with the words: "certainly i am sorry that
 two such gentlemen as these should fight on our behalf over so small a
 disagreement. but i cannot disregard my claim, for i am in too great need
 of it. so i should be much obliged to you if you would give me what is
 rightly mine." "surely," the other said, "any one would be a fool to
 consider thy demands. may i burn in evil fire and flame if i give thee
 anything to ease thy life! the banks of the seine will meet, and the hour
 of prime will be called noon, before i refuse to carry out the fight."
 "may god and the right, which i have in this cause, and in which i trust
 and have trusted till the present time, aid him, who in charity and
 courtesy has offered himself in my service, though he knows not who i am,
 and though we are ignorant of each other's identity."
 (vv. -.) so they talked until their conversation ceased, and then
 produced the knights in the middle of the court. then all the people crowd
 about, as people are wont to do when they wish to witness blows in battle
 or in joust. but those who were about to fight did not recognise each
 other, though their relations were wont to be very affectionate. then do
 they not love each other now? i would answer you both "yes" and "no." and
 i shall prove that each answer is correct. in truth, my lord gawain loves
 yvain and regards him as his companion, and so does yvain regard him,
 wherever he may be. even here, if he knew who he was, he would make much
 of him, and either one of them would lay down his head for the other
 before he would allow any harm to come to him. is not that a perfect and
 lofty love? yes, surely. but, on the other hand, is not their hate equally
 manifest? yes; for it is a certain thing that doubtless each would be glad
 to have broken the other's head, and so to have injured him as to cause
 his humiliation. upon my word, it is a wondrous thing, that love and
 mortal hate should dwell together. god! how can two things so opposed find
 lodging in the same dwelling-place? it seems to me they cannot live
 together; for one could not dwell with the other, without giving rise to
 noise and contention, as soon as each knew of the other's presence. but
 upon the ground-floor there may be several apartments: for there are halls
 and sleeping-rooms. it may be the same in this case: i think love had
 ensconced himself in some hidden room, while hate had betaken herself to
 the balconies looking on the high-road, because she wishes to be seen.
 just now hate is in the saddle, and spurs and pricks forward as she can,
 to get ahead of love who is indisposed to move. ah! love, what has become
 of thee? come out now, and thou shalt see what a host has been brought up
 and opposed to thee by the enemies of thy friends. the enemies are these
 very men who love each other with such a holy love for love, which is
 neither false nor feigned, is a precious and a holy thing. in this case
 love is completely blind, and hate, too, is deprived of sight. for if love
 had recognised these two men, he must have forbidden each to attack the
 other, or to do any thing to cause him harm. in this respect, then, love
 is blind and discomfited and beguiled; for, though he sees them, he fails
 to recognise those who rightly belong to him. and though hate is unable to
 tell why one of them should hate the other, yet she tries to engage them
 wrongfully, so that each hates the other mortally. you know, of course,
 that he cannot be said to love a man who would wish to harm him and see
 him dead. how then? does yvain wish to kill his friend, my lord gawain?
 yes, and the desire is mutual. would, then, my lord gawain desire to kill
 yvain with his own hands, or do even worse than i have said? nay, not
 really, i swear and protest. one would not wish to injure or harm the
 other, in return for all that god has done for man, or for all the empire
 of rome. but this, in turn, is a lie of mine, for it is plainly to be seen
 that, with lance raised high in rest, each is ready to attack the other,
 and there will be no restraint of the desire of each to wound the other
 with intent to injure him and work him woe. now tell me! when one will
 have defeated the other, of whom can he complain who has the worst of it?
 for if they go so far as to come to blows, i am very much afraid that they
 will continue the battle and the strife until victory be definitely
 decided. if he is defeated, will yvain be justified in saying that he has
 been harmed and wronged by a man who counts him among his friends, and who
 has never mentioned him but by the name of friend or companion? or, if it
 comes about perchance that yvain should hurt him in turn, or defeat him in
 any way, will gawain have the right to complain? nay, for he will not know
 whose fault it is. in ignorance of each other's identity, they both drew
 off and took their distance. at this first shock, their lances break,
 though they were stout, and made of ash. not a word do they exchange, for
 if they had stopped to converse their meeting would have been different.
 in that case, no blow would have been dealt with lance or sword; they
 would have kissed and embraced each other rather than sought each other's
 harm. for now they attack each other with injurious intent. the condition
 of the swords is not improved, nor that of the helmets and shields, which
 are dented and split; and the edges of the swords are nicked and dulled.
 for they strike each other violently, not with the fiat of the swords, but
 with the edge, and they deal such blows with the pommels upon the
 nose-guards and upon the neck, forehead and cheeks, that they are all
 marked black and blue where the blood collects beneath the skin. and their
 hauberks are so torn, and their shields so broken in pieces, that neither
 one escaped without wounds. their breath is almost exhausted with the
 labour of the strife; they hammer away at each other so lustily that every
 hyacinth and emerald set in their helmets is crushed and smashed. for they
 give each other such a battering with their pommels upon the helmets that
 they are quite stunned, as they almost beat out each other's brains. the
 eyes in their heads gleam like sparks, as, with stout square fists, and
 strong nerves, and hard bones, they strike each other upon the mouth as
 long as they can grip their swords, which are of great service to them in
 dealing their heavy blows.
 (vv. -.) when they had for a long time strained themselves, until
 the helmets were crushed, and the hauberks' meshes were torn apart with
 the hammering of the swords, and the shields were split and cracked, they
 drew apart a little to give their pulse a rest and to catch their breath
 again. however, they do not long delay, but run at each other again more
 fiercely than before. and all declare that they never saw two more
 courageous knights. "this fight between them is no jest, but they are in
 grim earnest. they will never be repaid for their merits and deserts." the
 two friends, in their bitter struggle, heard these words, and heard how
 the people were talking of reconciling the two sisters; but they had no
 success in placating the elder one. and the younger one said she would
 leave it to the king, and would not gainsay him in anything. but the elder
 one was so obstinate that even the queen guinevere and the knights and the
 king and the ladies and the townspeople side with the younger sister, and
 all join in beseeching the king to give her a third or a fourth part of
 the land in spite of the elder sister, and to separate the two knights who
 had displayed such bravery, for it would be too bad if one should injure
 the other or deprive him of any honour. and the king replied that he would
 take no hand in making peace, for the elder sister is so cruel that she
 has no desire for it. all these words were heard by the two, who were
 attacking each other so bitterly that all were astonished thereat; for the
 battle is waged so evenly that it is impossible to judge which has the
 better and which the worse. even the two men themselves, who fight, and
 who are purchasing honour with agony, are filled with amazement and stand
 aghast, for they are so well matched in their attack, that each wonders
 who it can be that withstands him with such bravery. they fight so long
 that the day draws on to night, while their arms grow weary and their
 bodies sore, and the hot, boiling blood flows from many a spot and
 trickles down beneath their hauberks: they are in such distress that it is
 no wonder if they wish to rest. then both withdraw to rest themselves,
 each thinking within himself that, however long he has had to wait, he now
 at last has met his match. for some time they thus seek repose, without
 daring to resume the fight. they feel no further desire to fight, because
 of the night which is growing dark, and because of the respect they feel
 for each other's might. these two considerations keep them apart, and urge
 them to keep the peace. but before they leave the field they will discover
 each other's identity, and joy and mercy will be established between them.
 (vv. -.) my brave and courteous lord yvain was the first to speak.
 but his good friend was unable to recognise him by his utterance; for he
 was prevented by his low tone and by his voice which was hoarse, weak, and
 broken; for his blood was all stirred up by the blows he had received. "my
 lord," he says, "the night comes on! i think no blame or reproach will
 attach to us if the night comes between us. but i am willing to admit, for
 my own part, that i feel great respect and admiration for you, and never
 in my life have i engaged in a battle which has made me smart so much, nor
 did i ever expect to see a knight whose acquaintance i should so yearn to
 make. you know well how to land your blows and how to make good use of
 them: i have never known a knight who was so skilled in dealing blows. it
 was against my will that i received all the blows you have bestowed on me
 to-day; i am stunned by the blows you have i struck upon my head." "upon
 my word," my lord gawain replies, "you are not so stunned and faint but
 that i am as much so, or more. and if i should tell you the simple truth,
 i think you would not be loath to hear it, for if i have lent you anything
 of mine, you have fully paid me back, principal and interest; for you were
 more ready to pay back than i was to accept the payment. but however that
 may be, since you wish me to inform you of my name, it shall not be kept
 from you: my name is gawain the son of king lot." as soon as my lord yvain
 heard that, he was amazed and sorely troubled; angry and grief-stricken,
 he cast upon the ground his bloody sword and broken shield, then
 dismounted from his horse, and cried: "alas, what mischance is this!
 through what unhappy ignorance in not recognising each other have we waged
 this battle! for if i had known who you were, i should never have fought
 with you; but, upon my word, i should have surrendered without a blow."
 "how is that?" my lord gawain inquires, "who are you, then?" "i am yvain,
 who love you more than any man in the whole wide world, for you have
 always been fond of me and shown me honour in every court. but i wish to
 make you such amends and do you such honour in this affair that i will
 confess myself to have been defeated." "will you do so much for my sake?"
 my gentle lord gawain asks him; "surely i should be presumptuous to accept
 any such amends from you. this honour shall never be claimed as mine, but
 it shall be yours, to whom i resign it." "ah, fair sire, do not speak so.
 for that could never be. i am so wounded and exhausted that i cannot
 endure more." "surely, you have no cause to be concerned." his friend and
 companion replies; "but for my part, i am defeated and overcome; i say it
 not as a compliment; for there is no stranger in the world, to whom i
 would not say as much, rather than receive any more blows." thus saying,
 he got down from his horse, and they threw their arms about each other's
 neck, kissing each other, and each continuing to assert that it is he who
 has met defeat. the argument is still in progress when the king and the
 knights come running up from every side, at the sight of their
 reconciliation; and great is their desire to hear how this can be, and who
 these men are who manifest such happiness. the king says: "gentlemen, tell
 us now who it is that has so suddenly brought about this friendship and
 harmony between you two, after the hatred and strife there has been this
 day?" then his nephew, my lord gawain, thus answers him: "my lord, you
 shall be informed of the misfortune and mischance which have been the
 cause of our strife. since you have tarried in order to hear and learn the
 cause of it, it is right to let you know the truth. i, gawain, who am your
 nephew, did not recognise this companion of mine, my lord yvain, until he
 fortunately, by the will of god, asked me my name. after each had informed
 the other of his name, we recognised each other, but not until we had
 fought it out. our struggle already has been long; and if we had fought
 yet a little longer, it would have fared ill with me, for, by my head, he
 would have killed me, what with his prowess and the evil cause of her who
 chose me as her champion. but i would rather be defeated than killed by a
 friend in battle." then my lord yvain's blood was stirred, as he said to
 him in reply: "fair dear sire, so help me god, you have no right to say so
 much. let my lord, the king, well know in this battle i am surely the one
 who has been defeated and overcome!" "i am the one" "no, i am." thus each
 cries out, and both are so honest and courteous that each allows the
 victory and crown to be the other's prize, while neither one of them will
 accept it. thus each strives to convince the king and all the people that
 he has been defeated and overthrown. but when he had listened to them for
 a while, the king terminated the dispute. he was well pleased with what he
 heard and with the sight of them in each other's arms, though they had
 wounded and injured each other in several places. "my lords," he says,
 "there is deep affection between you two. you give clear evidence of that,
 when each insists that it is he who has been defeated. now leave it all to
 me! for i think i can arrange it in such a way that it will redound to
 your honour, and every one will give consent." then they both promised him
 that they would do his will in every particular. and the king says that he
 will decide the quarrel fairly and faithfully. "where is the damsel," he
 inquires, "who has ejected her sister from her land, and has forcibly and
 cruelly disinherited her?" "my lord," she answers, "here i am." "are you
 there? then draw near to me! i saw plainly some time ago that you were
 disinheriting her. but her right shall no longer be denied; for you
 yourself have avowed the truth to me. you must now resign her share to
 her." "sire," she says, "if i uttered a foolish and thoughtless word, you
 ought not to take me up in it. for god's sake, sire, do not be hard on me!
 you are a king, and you ought to guard against wrong and error." the king
 replies: "that is precisely why i wish to give your sister her rights; for
 i have never defended what is wrong. and you have surely heard how your
 knight and hers have left the matter in my hands. i shall not say what is
 altogether pleasing to you; for your injustice is well known. in his
 desire to honour the other, each one says that he has been defeated. but
 there is no need to delay further: since the matter has been left to me,
 either you will do in all respects what i say, without resistance, or i
 shall announce that my nephew has been defeated in the fight. that would
 be the worst thing that could happen to your cause, and i shall be sorry
 to make such a declaration." in reality, he would not have said it for
 anything; but he spoke thus in order to see if he could frighten her into
 restoring the heritage to her sister; for he clearly saw that she never
 would surrender anything to her for any words of his unless she was
 influenced by force or fear. in fear and apprehension, she replied to him:
 "fair lord, i must now respect your desire, though my heart is very loath
 to yield. yet, however hard it may go with me, i shall do it, and my
 sister shall have what belongs to her. i give her your own person as a
 pledge of her share in my inheritance, in order that she may be more
 assured of it." "endow her with it, then, at once," the king replies; "let
 her receive it from your hands, and let her vow fidelity to you! do you
 love her as your vassal, and let her love you as her sovereign lady and as
 her sister." thus the king conducts the affair until the damsel takes
 possession of her land, and offers her thanks to him for it. then the king
 asked the valiant and brave knight who was his nephew to allow himself to
 be disarmed; and he requested my lord yvain to lay aside his arms also;
 for now they may well dispense with them. then the two vassals lay aside
 their arms and separate on equal terms. and while they are taking off
 their armour, they see the lion running up in search of his master. as
 soon as he catches sight of him, he begins to show his joy. then you would
 have seen people draw aside, and the boldest among them takes to flight.
 my lord yvain cries out: "stand still, all! why do you flee? no one is
 chasing you. have no fear that yonder lion will do you harm. believe me,
 please, when i say that he is mine, and i am his, and we are both
 companions." then it was known of a truth by all those who had heard tell
 of the adventures of the lion and of his companion that this must be the
 very man who had killed the wicked giant. and my lord gawain said to him:
 "sir companion, so help me god, you have overwhelmed me with shame this
 day. i did not deserve the service that you did me in killing the giant to
 save my nephews and my niece. i have been thinking about you for some
 time, and i was troubled because it was said that we were acquainted as
 loving friends. i have surely thought much upon the subject: but i could
 not hit upon the truth, and had never heard of any knight that i had known
 in any land where i had been, who was called 'the knight with the lion.'"
 while they chatted thus they took their armour off, and the lion came with
 no slow step to the place where his master sat, and showed such joy as a
 dumb beast could. then the two knights had to be removed to a sick-room
 and infirmary, for they needed a doctor and piaster to cure their wounds.
 king arthur, who loved them well, had them both brought before him, and
 summoned a surgeon whose knowledge of surgery was supreme. he exercised
 his art in curing them, until he had healed their wounds as well and as
 quickly as possible. when he had cured them both, my lord yvain, who had
 his heart set fast on love, saw clearly that he could not live, but that
 he finally would die unless his lady took pity upon him; for he was dying
 for love of her; so he thought he would go away from the court alone, and
 would go to fight at the spring that belonged to her, where he would cause
 such a storm of wind and rain that she would be compelled perforce to make
 peace with him; otherwise, there would be no end to the disturbance of the
 spring, and to the rain and wind.
 (vv. -.) as soon as my lord yvain felt that he was cured and sound
 again, he departed without the knowledge of any one. but he had with him
 his lion, who never in his life wished to desert him. they travelled until
 they saw the spring and made the rain descend. think not that this is a
 lie of mine, when i tell you that the disturbance was so violent that no
 one could tell the tenth part of it: for it seemed as if the whole forest
 must surely be engulfed. the lady fears for her town, lest it, too, will
 crumble away; the walls totter, and the tower rocks so that it is on the
 verge of falling down. the bravest turk would rather be a captive in
 persia than be shut up within those walls. the people are so stricken with
 terror that they curse all their ancestors, saying: "confounded be the man
 who first constructed a house in this neighbourhood, and all those who
 built this town! for in the wide world they could not have found so
 detestable a spot, for a single man is able here to invade and worry and
 harry us." "you must take counsel in this matter, my lady," says lunete;
 "you will find no one who will undertake to aid you in this time of need
 unless you seek for him afar. in the future we shall never be secure in
 this town, nor dare to pass beyond the walls and gate. you know full well
 that, were some one to summon together all your knights for this cause,
 the best of them would not dare to step forward. if it is true that you
 have no one to defend your spring, you will appear ridiculous and
 humiliated. it will redound greatly to your honour, forsooth, if he who
 has attacked you shall retire without a fight! surely you are in a bad
 predicament if you do not devise some other plan to benefit yourself." the
 lady replies: "do thou, who art so wise, tell me what plan i can devise,
 and i will follow thy advice." "indeed, lady, if i had any plan, i should
 gladly propose it to you. but you have great need of a wiser counsellor.
 so i shall certainly not dare to intrude, and in common with the others i
 shall endure the rain and wind until, if it please god, i shall see some
 worthy man appear here in your court who will assume the responsibility
 and burden of the battle; but i do not believe that that will happen
 to-day, and we have not yet seen the worst of your urgent need." then the
 lady replies at once: "damsel, speak now of something else! say no more of
 the people of my household; for i cherish no further expectation that the
 spring and its marble brim will ever be defended by any of them. but, if
 it please god, let us hear now what is your opinion and plan; for people
 always say that in time of need one can test his friend." 
 "my lady, if there is any one who thinks he could find him who slew the
 giant and defeated the three knights, he would do well to go to search for
 him. but so long as he shall incur the enmity, wrath, and displeasure of
 his lady, i fancy there is not under heaven any man or woman whom he would
 follow, until he had been assured upon oath that everything possible would
 be done to appease the hostility which his lady feels for him, and which
 is so bitter that he is dying of the grief and anxiety it causes him." and
 the lady said: "before you enter upon the quest, i am prepared to promise
 you upon my word and to swear that, if he will return to me, i will openly
 and frankly do all i can to bring about his peace of mind." then lunete
 replies to her: "lady, have no fear that you cannot easily effect his
 reconciliation, when once it is your desire to do so; but, if you do not
 object, i will take your oath before i start." "i have no objection," the
 lady says. with delicate courtesy, lunete procured at once for her a very
 precious relic, and the lady fell upon her knees. thus lunete very
 courteously accepted her upon her oath. in administering the oath, she
 forgot nothing which it might be an advantage to insert. "lady," she says,
 "now raise your hand! i do not wish that the day after to-morrow you
 should lay any charge upon me; for you are not doing anything for me, but
 you are acting for your own good. if you please now, you shall swear that
 you will exert yourself in the interests of the knight with the lion until
 he recover his lady's love as completely as he ever possessed it." the
 lady then raised her right hand and said: "i swear to all that thou hast
 said, so help me god and his holy saint, that my heart may never fail to
 do all within my power. if i have the strength and ability, i will restore
 to him the love and favour which with his lady he once enjoyed."
 (vv. -.) lunete has now done well her work; there was nothing
 which she had desired so much as the object which she had now attained.
 they had already got out for her a palfrey with an easy pace. gladly and
 in a happy frame of mind lunete mounts and rides away, until she finds
 beneath the pine-tree him whom she did not expect to find so near at hand.
 indeed, she had thought that she would have to seek afar before
 discovering him. as soon as she saw him, she recognised him by the lion,
 and coming toward him rapidly, she dismounted upon the solid earth. and my
 lord yvain recognised her as soon as he saw her, and greeted her, as she
 saluted him with the words: "sire, i am very happy to have found you so
 near at hand." and my lord yvain said in reply: "how is that? were you
 looking for me, then?" "yes, sire, and in all my life i have never felt so
 glad, for i have made my mistress promise, if she does not go back upon
 her word, that she will be again your lady as was once the case, and that
 you shall be her lord; this truth i make bold to tell." my lord yvain was
 greatly elated at the news he hears, and which he had never expected to
 hear again. he could not sufficiently show his gratitude to her who had
 accomplished this for him. he kisses her eyes, and then her face, saying:
 "surely, my sweet friend, i can never repay you for this service. i fear
 that ability and time will fail me to do you the honour and service which
 is your due." "sire," she replies, "have no concern, and let not that
 thought worry you! for you will have an abundance of strength and time to
 show me and others your good will. if i have paid this debt i owed, i am
 entitled to only so much gratitude as the man who borrows another's goods
 and then discharges the obligation. even now i do not consider that i have
 paid you the debt i owed." "indeed you have, as god sees me, more than
 five hundred thousand times. now, when you are ready, let us go. but have
 you told her who i am?" "no, i have not, upon my word. she knows you only
 by the name of 'the knight with the lion.'"
 (vv. -.) thus conversing they went along, with the lion following
 after them, until they all three came to the town. they said not a word to
 any man or woman there, until they arrived where the lady was. and the
 lady was greatly pleased as soon as she heard that the damsel was
 approaching, and that she was bringing with her the lion and the knight,
 whom she was very anxious to meet and know and see. all clad in his arms,
 my lord yvain fell at her feet upon his knees, while lunete, who was
 standing by, said to her: "raise him up, lady, and apply all your efforts
 and strength and skill in procuring that peace and pardon which no one in
 the world, except you, can secure for him." then the lady bade him rise,
 and said: "he may dispose of all my power! i shall be very happy, if
 possible, to accomplish his wish and his desire." "surely, my lady,"
 lunete replied, "i would not say it if it were not true. but all this is
 even more possible for you than i have said: but now i will tell you the
 whole truth, and you shall see: you never had and you never will have such
 a good friend as this gentleman. god, whose will it is that there should
 be unending peace and love between you and him, has caused me to find him
 this day so near at hand. in order to test the truth of this, i have only
 one thing to say: lady, dismiss the grudge you bear him! for he has no
 other mistress than you. this is your husband, my lord yvain."
 (vv. -.) the lady, trembling at these words, replied: "god save
 me! you have caught me neatly in a trap! you will make me love, in spite
 of myself, a man who neither loves nor esteems me. this is a fine piece of
 work, and a charming way of serving me! i would rather endure the winds
 and the tempests all my life: and if it were not a mean and ugly thing to
 break one's word, he would never make his peace or be reconciled with me.
 this purpose would have always lurked within me, as a fire smoulders in
 the ashes; but i do not wish to renew it now, nor do i care to refer to
 it, since i must be reconciled with him."
 (vv. -.) my lord yvain hears and understands that his cause is
 going well, and that he will be peacefully reconciled with her. so he
 says: "lady, one ought to have mercy on a sinner. i have had to pay, and
 dearly to pay, for my mad act. it was madness that made me stay away, and
 i now admit my guilt and sin. i have been bold, indeed, in daring to
 present myself to you; but if you will deign to keep me now, i never again
 shall do you any wrong." she replied: "i will surely consent to that; for
 if i did not do all i could to establish peace between you and me, i
 should be guilty of perjury. so, if you please, i grant your request."
 "lady," says he, "so truly as god in this mortal life could not otherwise
 restore me to happiness, so may the holy spirit bless me five hundred
 times!"
 (vv. -.) now my lord yvain is reconciled, and you may believe
 that, in spite of the trouble he has endured, he was never so happy for
 anything. all has turned out well at last; for he is beloved and treasured
 by his lady, and she by him. his troubles no longer are in his mind; for
 he forgets them all in the joy he feels with his precious wife. and
 lunete, for her part, is happy too: all her desires are satisfied when
 once she had made an enduring peace between my polite lord yvain and his
 sweetheart so dear and so elegant.
 (vv. -.) thus chretien concludes his romance of the knight with
 the lion; for i never heard any more told of it, nor will you ever hear
 any further particulars, unless some one wishes to add some lies.

 or, the knight of the cart
 (vv. -.) since my lady of champagne wishes me to undertake to write a
 romance, 
 i shall very gladly do so, being so devoted to her service as to do
 anything in the world for her, without any intention of flattery. but if
 one were to introduce any flattery upon such an occasion, he might say,
 and i would subscribe to it, that this lady surpasses all others who are
 alive, just as the south wind which blows in may or april is more lovely
 than any other wind. but upon my word, i am not one to wish to flatter my
 lady. i will simply say: "the countess is worth as many queens as a gem is
 worth of pearls and sards." nay i shall make no comparison, and yet it is
 true in spite of me; i will say, however, that her command has more to do
 with this work than any thought or pains that i may expend upon it. here
 chretien begins his book about the knight of the cart. the material and
 the treatment of it are given and furnished to him by the countess, and he
 is simply trying to carry out her concern and intention. here he begins
 the story.
 (vv. -.) upon a certain ascension day king arthur had come from
 caerleon, and had held a very magnificent court at camelot as was fitting
 on such a day.  after the feast the king did not
 quit his noble companions, of whom there were many in the hall. the queen
 was present, too, and with her many a courteous lady able to converse in
 french. and kay, who had furnished the meal, was eating with the others
 who had served the food. while kay was sitting there at meat, behold there
 came to court a knight, well equipped and fully armed, and thus the knight
 appeared before the king as he sat among his lords. he gave him no
 greeting, but spoke out thus: "king arthur, i hold in captivity knights,
 ladies, and damsels who belong to thy dominion and household; but it is
 not because of any intention to restore them to thee that i make reference
 to them here; rather do i wish to proclaim and serve thee notice that thou
 hast not the strength or the resources to enable thee to secure them
 again. and be assured that thou shalt die before thou canst ever succour
 them." the king replies that he must needs endure what he has not the
 power to change; nevertheless, he is filled with grief. then the knight
 makes as if to go away, and turns about, without tarrying longer before
 the king; but after reaching the door of the hall, he does not go down the
 stairs, but stops and speaks from there these words: "king, if in thy
 court there is a single knight in whom thou hast such confidence that thou
 wouldst dare to entrust to him the queen that he might escort her after me
 out into the woods whither i am going, i will promise to await him there,
 and will surrender to thee all the prisoners whom i hold in exile in my
 country if he is able to defend the queen and if he succeeds in bringing
 her back again." many who were in the palace heard this challenge, and the
 whole court was in an uproar. kay, too, heard the news as he sat at meat
 with those who served. leaving the table, he came straight to the king,
 and as if greatly enraged, he began to say: "o king, i have served thee
 long, faithfully, and loyally; now i take my leave, and shall go away,
 having no desire to serve thee more." the king was grieved at what he
 heard, and as soon as he could, he thus replied to him: "is this serious,
 or a joke?" and kay replied: "o king, fair sire, i have no desire to jest,
 and i take my leave quite seriously. no other reward or wages do i wish in
 return for the service i have given you. my mind is quite made up to go
 away immediately." "is it in anger or in spite that you wish to go?" the
 king inquired; "seneschal, remain at court, as you have done hitherto, and
 be assured that i have nothing in the world which i would not give you at
 once in return for your consent to stay." "sire," says kay, "no need of
 that. i would not accept for each day's pay a measure of fine pure gold."
 thereupon, the king in great dismay went off to seek the queen. "my lady,"
 he says, "you do not know the demand that the seneschal makes of me. he
 asks me for leave to go away, and says he will no longer stay at court;
 the reason of this i do not know. but he will do at your request what he
 will not do for me. go to him now, my lady dear. since he will not consent
 to stay for my sake, pray him to remain on your account, and if need be,
 fall at his feet, for i should never again be happy if i should lose his
 company." 
 the king sends the queen to the seneschal, and she goes to him. finding
 him with the rest, she went up to him, and said: "kay, you may be very
 sure that i am greatly troubled by the news i have heard of you. i am
 grieved to say that i have been told it is your intention to leave the
 king. how does this come about? what motive have you in your mind? i
 cannot think that you are so sensible or courteous as usual. i want to ask
 you to remain: stay with us here, and grant my prayer." "lady," he says,
 "i give you thanks; nevertheless, i shall not remain." the queen again
 makes her request, and is joined by all the other knights. and kay informs
 her that he is growing tired of a service which is unprofitable. then the
 queen prostrates herself at full length before his feet. kay beseeches her
 to rise, but she says that she will never do so until he grants her
 request. then kay promises her to remain, provided the king and she will
 grant in advance a favour he is about to ask. "kay," she says, "he will
 grant it, whatever it may be. come now, and we shall tell him that upon
 this condition you will remain." so kay goes away with the queen to the
 king's presence. the queen says: "i have had hard work to detain kay; but
 i have brought him here to you with the understanding that you will do
 what he is going to ask." the king sighed with satisfaction, and said that
 he would perform whatever request he might make.
 (vv. -.) "sire," says kay, "hear now what i desire, and what is the
 gift you have promised me. i esteem myself very fortunate to gain such a
 boon with your consent. sire, you have pledged your word that you would
 entrust to me my lady here, and that we should go after the knight who
 awaits us in the forest." though the king is grieved, he trusts him with
 the charge, for he never went back upon his word. but it made him so
 ill-humoured and displeased that it plainly showed in his countenance. the
 queen, for her part, was sorry too, and all those of the household say
 that kay had made a proud, outrageous, and mad request. then the king took
 the queen by the hand, and said: "my lady, you must accompany kay without
 making objection." and kay said: "hand her over to me now, and have no
 fear, for i shall bring her back perfectly happy and safe." the king gives
 her into his charge, and he takes her off. after them all the rest go out,
 and there is not one who is not sad. you must know that the seneschal was
 fully armed, and his horse was led into the middle of the courtyard,
 together with a palfrey, as is fitting, for the queen. the queen walked up
 to the palfrey, which was neither restive nor hard-mouthed. grieving and
 sad, with a sigh the queen mounts, saying to herself in a low voice, so
 that no one could hear: "alas, alas, if you only knew it, i am sure you
 would never allow me without interference to be led away a step." 
 she thought she had spoken in a very low tone; but count guinable heard
 her, who was standing by when she mounted. when they started away, as
 great a lament was made by all the men and women present as if she already
 lay dead upon a bier. they do not believe that she will ever in her life
 come back. the seneschal in his impudence takes her where that other
 knight is awaiting her. but no one was so much concerned as to undertake
 to follow him; until at last my lord gawain thus addressed the king his
 uncle: "sire," he says, "you have done a very foolish thing, which causes
 me great surprise; but if you will take my advice, while they are still
 near by, i and you will ride after them, and all those who wish to
 accompany us. for my part, i cannot restrain myself from going in pursuit
 of them at once. it would not be proper for us not to go after them, at
 least far enough to learn what is to become of the queen, and how kay is
 going to comport himself." "ah, fair nephew," the king replied, "you have
 spoken courteously. and since you have undertaken the affair, order our
 horses to be led out bridled and saddled that there may be no delay in
 setting out."
 (vv. -.) the horses are at once brought out, all ready and with the
 saddles on. first the king mounts, then my lord gawain, and all the others
 rapidly. each one, wishing to be of the party, follows his own will and
 starts away. some were armed, but there were not a few without their arms.
 my lord gawain was armed, and he bade two squires lead by the bridle two
 extra steeds. and as they thus approached the forest, they saw kay's horse
 running out; and they recognised him, and saw that both reins of the
 bridle were broken. the horse was running wild, the stirrup-straps all
 stained with blood, and the saddle-bow was broken and damaged. every one
 was chagrined at this, and they nudged each other and shook their heads.
 my lord gawain was riding far in advance of the rest of the party, and it
 was not long before he saw coming slowly a knight on a horse that was
 sore, painfully tired, and covered with sweat. the knight first saluted my
 lord gawain, and his greeting my lord gawain returned. then the knight,
 recognising my lord gawain, stopped and thus spoke to him: "you see, sir,
 my horse is in a sweat and in such case as to be no longer serviceable. i
 suppose that those two horses belong to you now, with the understanding
 that i shall return the service and the favour, i beg you to let me have
 one or the other of them, either as a loan or outright as a gift." and he
 answers him: "choose whichever you prefer." then he who was in dire
 distress did not try to select the better or the fairer or the larger of
 the horses, but leaped quickly upon the one which was nearer to him, and
 rode him off. then the one he had just left fell dead, for he had ridden
 him hard that day, so that he was used up and overworked. the knight
 without delay goes pricking through the forest, and my lord gawain follows
 in pursuit of him with all speed, until he reaches the bottom of a hill.
 and when he had gone some distance, he found the horse dead which he had
 given to the knight, and noticed that the ground had been trampled by
 horses, and that broken shields and lances lay strewn about, so that it
 seemed that there had been a great combat between several knights, and he
 was very sorry and grieved not to have been there. however, he did not
 stay there long, but rapidly passed on until he saw again by chance the
 knight all alone on foot, completely armed, with helmet laced, shield
 hanging from his neck, and with his sword girt on. he had overtaken a
 cart. in those days such a cart served the same purpose as does a pillory
 now; and in each good town where there are more than three thousand such
 carts nowadays, in those times there was only one, and this, like our
 pillories, had to do service for all those who commit murder or treason,
 and those who are guilty of any delinquency, and for thieves who have
 stolen others' property or have forcibly seized it on the roads. whoever
 was convicted of any crime was placed upon a cart and dragged through all
 the streets, and he lost henceforth all his legal rights, and was never
 afterward heard, honoured, or welcomed in any court. the carts were so
 dreadful in those days that the saying was then first used: "when thou
 dost see and meet a cart, cross thyself and call upon god, that no evil
 may befall thee." the knight on foot, and without a lance, walked behind
 the cart, and saw a dwarf sitting on the shafts, who held, as a driver
 does, a long goad in his hand. then he cries out: "dwarf, for god's sake,
 tell me now if thou hast seen my lady, the queen, pass by here." the
 miserable, low-born dwarf would not give him any news of her, but replied:
 "if thou wilt get up into the cart i am driving thou shalt hear to-morrow
 what has happened to the queen." then he kept on his way without giving
 further heed. the knight hesitated only for a couple of steps before
 getting in. yet, it was unlucky for him that he shrank from the disgrace,
 and did not jump in at once; for he will later rue his delay. but common
 sense, which is inconsistent with love's dictates, bids him refrain from
 getting in, warning him and counselling him to do and undertake nothing
 for which he may reap shame and disgrace. reason, which dares thus speak
 to him, reaches only his lips, but not his heart; but love is enclosed
 within his heart, bidding him and urging him to mount at once upon the
 cart. so he jumps in, since love will have it so, feeling no concern about
 the shame, since he is prompted by love's commands. and my lord gawain
 presses on in haste after the cart, and when he finds the knight sitting
 in it, his surprise is great. "tell me," he shouted to the dwarf, "if thou
 knowest anything of the queen." and he replied: "if thou art so much thy
 own enemy as is this knight who is sitting here, get in with him, if it be
 thy pleasure, and i will drive thee along with him." when my lord gawain
 heard that, he considered it great foolishness, and said that he would not
 get in, for it would be dishonourable to exchange a horse for a cart: "go
 on, and wherever thy journey lies, i will follow after thee."
 (vv. -.) thereupon they start ahead, one mounted on his horse, the
 other two riding in the cart, and thus they proceed in company. late in
 the afternoon they arrive at a town, which, you must know, was very rich
 and beautiful. all three entered through the gate; the people are greatly
 amazed to see the knight borne upon the cart, and they take no pains to
 conceal their feelings, but small and great and old and young shout taunts
 at him in the streets, so that the knight hears many vile and scornful
 words at his expense.  they all inquire: "to what
 punishment is this knight to be consigned? is he to be rayed, or hanged,
 or drowned, or burned upon a fire of thorns? tell us, thou dwarf, who art
 driving him, in what crime was he caught? is he convicted of robbery? is
 he a murderer, or a criminal?" and to all this the dwarf made no response,
 vouchsafing to them no reply. he conducts the knight to a lodging-place;
 and gawain follows the dwarf closely to a tower, which stood on the same
 level over against the town. beyond there stretched a meadow, and the
 tower was built close by, up on a lofty eminence of rock, whose face
 formed a sharp precipice. following the horse and cart, gawain entered the
 tower. in the hall they met a damsel elegantly attired, than whom there
 was none fairer in the land, and with her they saw coming two fair and
 charming maidens. as soon as they saw my lord gawain, they received him
 joyously and saluted him, and then asked news about the other knight:
 "dwarf, of what crime is this knight guilty, whom thou dost drive like a
 lame man?" he would not answer her question, but he made the knight get
 out of the cart, and then he withdrew, without their knowing whither he
 went. then my lord gawain dismounts, and valets come forward to relieve
 the two knights of their armour. the damsel ordered two green mantles to
 be brought, which they put on. when the hour for supper came, a sumptuous
 repast was set. the damsel sat at table beside my lord gawain. they would
 not have changed their lodging-place to seek any other, for all that
 evening the damsel showed them gear honour, and provided them with fair
 and pleasant company.
 (vv. -.) when they had sat up long enough, two long, high beds were
 prepared in the middle of the hall; and there was another bed alongside,
 fairer and more splendid than the rest; for, as the story testifies, it
 possessed all the excellence that one could think of in a bed. when the
 time came to retire, the damsel took both the guests to whom she had
 offered her hospitality; she shows them the two fine, long, wide beds, and
 says: "these two beds are set up here for the accommodation of your
 bodies; but in that one yonder no one ever lay who did not merit it: it
 was not set up to be used by you." the knight who came riding on the cart
 replies at once: "tell me," he says, "for what cause this bed is
 inaccessible." being thoroughly informed of this, she answers
 unhesitatingly: "it is not your place to ask or make such an inquiry. any
 knight is disgraced in the land after being in a cart, and it is not
 fitting that he should concern himself with the matter upon which you have
 questioned me; and most of all it is not right that he should lie upon the
 bed, for he would soon pay dearly for his act. so rich a couch has not
 been prepared for you, and you would pay dearly for ever harbouring such a
 thought." he replies: "you will see about that presently.".... "am i to
 see it?".... "yes.".... "it will soon appear.".... "by my head," the
 knight replies, "i know not who is to pay the penalty. but whoever may
 object or disapprove, i intend to lie upon this bed and repose there at my
 ease." then he at once disrobed in the bed, which was long and raised half
 an ell above the other two, and was covered with a yellow cloth of silk
 and a coverlet with gilded stars. the furs were not of skinned vair but of
 sable; the covering he had on him would have been fitting for a king. the
 mattress was not made of straw or rushes or of old mats. at midnight there
 descended from the rafters suddenly a lance, as with the intention of
 pinning the knight through the flanks to the coverlet and the white sheets
 where he lay.  to the lance there was attached
 a pennon all ablaze. the coverlet, the bedclothes, and the bed itself all
 caught fire at once. and the tip of the lance passed so close to the
 knight's side that it cut the skin a little, without seriously wounding
 him. then the knight got up, put out the fire and, taking the lance, swung
 it in the middle of the hall, all this without leaving his bed; rather did
 he lie down again and slept as securely as at first.
 (vv. -.) in the morning, at daybreak, the damsel of the tower had
 mass celebrated on their account, and had them rise and dress. when mass
 had been celebrated for them, the knight who had ridden in the cart sat
 down pensively at a window, which looked out upon the meadow, and he gazed
 upon the fields below. the damsel came to another window close by, and
 there my lord gawain conversed with her privately for a while about
 something, i know not what. i do not know what words were uttered, but
 while they were leaning on the window-sill they saw carried along the
 river through the fields a bier, upon which there lay a knight, 
 and alongside three damsels walked, mourning bitterly. behind the bier
 they saw a crowd approaching, with a tall knight in front, leading a fair
 lady by the horse's rein. the knight at the window knew that it was the
 queen. he continued to gaze at her attentively and with delight as long as
 she was visible. and when he could no longer see her, he was minded to
 throw himself out and break his body down below. and he would have let
 himself fall out had not my lord gawain seen him, and drawn him back,
 saying: "i beg you, sire, be quiet now. for god's sake, never think again
 of committing such a mad deed. it is wrong for you to despise your life."
 "he is perfectly right," the damsel says; "for will not the news of his
 disgrace be known everywhere? since he has been upon the cart, he has good
 reason to wish to die, for he would be better dead than alive. his life
 henceforth is sure to be one of shame, vexation, and unhappiness." then
 the knights asked for their armour, and armed themselves, the damsel
 treating them courteously, with distinction and generosity; for when she
 had joked with the knight and ridiculed him enough, she presented him with
 a horse and lance as a token of her goodwill. the knights then courteously
 and politely took leave of the damsel, first saluting her, and then going
 off in the direction taken by the crowd they had seen. thus they rode out
 from the town without addressing them. they proceeded quickly in the
 direction they had seen taken by the queen, but they did not overtake the
 procession, which had advanced rapidly. after leaving the fields, the
 knights enter an enclosed place, and find a beaten road. they advanced
 through the woods until it might be six o'clock,  and then
 at a crossroads they met a damsel, whom they both saluted, each asking and
 requesting her to tell them, if she knows, whither the queen has been
 taken. replying intelligently, she said to them: "if you would pledge me
 your word, i could set you on the right road and path, and i would tell
 you the name of the country and of the knight who is conducting her; but
 whoever would essay to enter that country must endure sore trials, for
 before he could reach there he must suffer much." then my lord gawain
 replies: "damsel, so help me god, i promise to place all my strength at
 your disposal and service, whenever you please, if you will tell me now
 the truth." and he who had been on the cart did not say that he would
 pledge her all his strength; but he proclaims, like one whom love makes
 rich, powerful and bold for any enterprise, that at once and without
 hesitation he will promise her anything she desires, and he puts himself
 altogether at her disposal. "then i will tell you the truth," says she.
 then the damsel relates to them the following story: "in truth, my lords,
 meleagant, a tall and powerful knight, son of the king of gorre, has taken
 her off into the kingdom whence no foreigner returns, but where he must
 perforce remain in servitude and banishment." then they ask her: "damsel,
 where is this country? where can we find the way thither?" she replies:
 "that you shall quickly learn; but you may be sure that you will meet with
 many obstacles and difficult passages, for it is not easy to enter there
 except with the permission of the king, whose name is bademagu; however,
 it is possible to enter by two very perilous paths and by two very
 difficult passage-ways. one is called the water-bridge, because the bridge
 is under water, and there is the same amount of water beneath it as above
 it, so that the bridge is exactly in the middle; and it is only a foot and
 a half in width and in thickness. this choice is certainly to be avoided,
 and yet it is the less dangerous of the two. in addition there are a
 number of other obstacles of which i will say nothing. the other bridge is
 still more impracticable and much more perilous, never having been crossed
 by man. it is just like a sharp sword, and therefore all the people call
 it 'the sword-bridge'. now i have told you all the truth i know." but they
 ask of her once again: "damsel, deign to show us these two passages." to
 which the damsel makes reply: "this road here is the most direct to the
 water-bridge, and that one yonder leads straight to the sword-bridge."
 then the knight, who had been on the cart, says: "sire, i am ready to
 share with you without prejudice: take one of these two routes, and leave
 the other one to me; take whichever you prefer." "in truth," my lord
 gawain replies, "both of them are hard and dangerous: i am not skilled in
 making such a choice, and hardly know which of them to take; but it is not
 right for me to hesitate when you have left the choice to me: i will
 choose the water-bridge." the other answers: "then i must go
 uncomplainingly to the sword-bridge, which i agree to do." thereupon, they
 all three part, each one commending the others very courteously to god.
 and when she sees them departing, she says: "each one of you owes me a
 favour of my choosing, whenever i may choose to ask it. take care not to
 forget that." "we shall surely not forget it, sweet friend," both the
 knights call out. then each one goes his own way, and he of the cart is
 occupied with deep reflections, like one who has no strength or defence
 against love which holds him in its sway. his thoughts are such that he
 totally forgets himself, and he knows not whether he is alive or dead,
 forgetting even his own name, not knowing whether he is armed or not, or
 whither he is going or whence he came. only one creature he has in mind,
 and for her his thought is so occupied that he neither sees nor hears
 aught else.  and his horse bears him along
 rapidly, following no crooked road, but the best and the most direct; and
 thus proceeding unguided, he brings him into an open plain. in this plain
 there was a ford, on the other side of which a knight stood armed, who
 guarded it, and in his company there was a damsel who had come on a
 palfrey. by this time the afternoon was well advanced, and yet the knight,
 unchanged and unwearied, pursued his thoughts. the horse, being very
 thirsty, sees clearly the ford, and as soon as he sees it, hastens toward
 it. then he on the other side cries out: "knight, i am guarding the ford,
 and forbid you to cross." he neither gives him heed, nor hears his words,
 being still deep in thought. in the meantime, his horse advanced rapidly
 toward the water. the knight calls out to him that he will do wisely to
 keep at a distance from the ford, for there is no passage that way; and he
 swears by the heart within his breast that he will smite him if he enters
 the water. but his threats are not heard, and he calls out to him a third
 time: "knight, do not enter the ford against my will and prohibition; for,
 by my head, i shall strike you as soon as i see you in the ford." but he
 is so deep in thought that he does not hear him. and the horse, quickly
 leaving the bank, leaps into the ford and greedily begins to drink. and
 the knight says he shall pay for this, that his shield and the hauberk he
 wears upon his back shall afford him no protection. first, he puts his
 horse at a gallop, and from a gallop he urges him to a run, and he strikes
 the knight so hard that he knocks him down flat in the ford which he had
 forbidden him to cross. his lance flew from his hand and the shield from
 his neck. when he feels the water, he shivers, and though stunned, he
 jumps to his feet, like one aroused from sleep, listening and looking
 about him with astonishment, to see who it can be who has struck him. then
 face to face with the other knight, he said: "vassal, tell me why you have
 struck me, when i was not aware of your presence, and when i had done you
 no harm." "upon my word, you had wronged me," the other says: "did you not
 treat me disdainfully when i forbade you three times to cross the ford,
 shouting at you as loudly as i could? you surely heard me challenge you at
 least two or three times, and you entered in spite of me, though i told
 you i should strike you as soon as i saw you in the ford." then the knight
 replies to him: "whoever heard you or saw you, let him be damned, so far
 as i am concerned. i was probably deep in thought when you forbade me to
 cross the ford. but be assured that i would make you reset it, if i could
 just lay one of my hands on your bridle." and the other replies: "why,
 what of that? if you dare, you may seize my bridle here and now. i do not
 esteem your proud threats so much as a handful of ashes." and he replies:
 "that suits me perfectly. however the affair may turn out, i should like
 to lay my hands on you." then the other knight advances to the middle of
 the ford, where the other lays his left hand upon his bridle, and his
 right hand upon his leg, pulling, dragging, and pressing him so roughly
 that he remonstrates, thinking that he would pull his leg out of his body.
 then he begs him to let go, saying: "knight, if it please thee to fight me
 on even terms, take thy shield and horse and lance, and joust with me." he
 answers: "that will i not do, upon my word; for i suppose thou wouldst run
 away as soon as thou hadst escaped my grip." hearing this, he was much
 ashamed, and said: "knight, mount thy horse, in confidence for i will
 pledge thee loyally my word that i shall not flinch or run away." then
 once again he answers him: "first, thou wilt have to swear to that, and i
 insist upon receiving thy oath that thou wilt neither run away nor flinch,
 nor touch me, nor come near me until thou shalt see me on my horse; i
 shall be treating thee very generously, if, when thou art in my hands, i
 let thee go." he can do nothing but give his oath; and when the other
 hears him swear, he gathers up his shield and lance which were floating in
 the ford and by this time had drifted well down-stream; then he returns
 and takes his horse. after catching and mounting him, he seizes the shield
 by the shoulder-straps and lays his lance in rest. then each spurs toward
 the other as fast as their horses can carry them. and he who had to defend
 the ford first attacks the other, striking him so hard that his lance is
 completely splintered. the other strikes him in return so that he throws
 him prostrate into the ford, and the water closes over him. having
 accomplished that, he draws back and dismounts, thinking he could drive
 and chase away a hundred such. while he draws from the scabbard his sword
 of steel, the other jumps up and draws his excellent flashing blade. then
 they clash again, advancing and covering themselves with the shields which
 gleam with gold. ceaselessly and without repose they wield their swords;
 they have the courage to deal so many blows that the battle finally is so
 protracted that the knight of the cart is greatly ashamed in his heart,
 thinking that he is making a sorry start in the way he has undertaken,
 when he has spent so much time in defeating a single knight. if he had met
 yesterday a hundred such, he does not think or believe that they could
 have withstood him; so now he is much grieved and wroth to be in such an
 exhausted state that he is missing his strokes and losing time. then he
 runs at him and presses him so hard that the other knight gives way and
 flees. however reluctant he may be, he leaves the ford and crossing free.
 but the other follows him in pursuit until he falls forward upon his
 hands; then he of the cart runs up to him, swearing by all he sees that he
 shall rue the day when he upset him in the ford and disturbed his revery.
 the damsel, whom the knight had with him, upon hearing the threats, is in
 great fear, and begs him for her sake to forbear from killing him; but he
 tells her that he must do so, and can show him no mercy for her sake, in
 view of the shameful wrong that he has done him. then, with sword drawn,
 he approaches the knight who cries in sore dismay: "for god's sake and for
 my own, show me the mercy i ask of you." and he replies: "as god may save
 me, no one ever sinned so against me that i would not show him mercy once,
 for god's sake as is right, if he asked it of me in god's name. and so on
 thee i will have mercy; for i ought not to refuse thee when thou hast
 besought me. but first, thou shalt give me thy word to constitute thyself
 my prisoner whenever i may wish to summon thee." though it was hard to do
 so, he promised him. at once the damsel said: "o knight, since thou hast
 granted the mercy he asked of thee, if ever thou hast broken any bonds,
 for my sake now be merciful and release this prisoner from his parole. set
 him free at my request, upon condition that when the time comes, i shall
 do my utmost to repay thee in any way that thou shalt choose." then he
 declares himself satisfied with the promise she has made, and sets the
 knight at liberty. then she is ashamed and anxious, thinking that he will
 recognise her, which she did not wish. but he goes away at once, the
 knight and the damsel commending him to god, and taking leave of him. he
 grants them leave to go, while he himself pursues his way, until late in
 the afternoon he met a damsel coming, who was very fair and charming, well
 attired and richly dressed. the damsel greets him prudently and
 courteously, and he replies: "damsel, god grant you health and happiness."
 then the damsel said to him: "sire, my house is prepared for you, if you
 will accept my hospitality, but you shall find shelter there only on
 condition that you will lie with me; upon these terms i propose and make
 the offer." not a few there are who would have thanked her five hundred
 times for such a gift; but he is much displeased, and made a very
 different answer: "damsel, i thank you for the offer of your house, and
 esteem it highly, but, if you please, i should be very sorry to lie with
 you." "by my eyes," the damsel says, "then i retract my offer." and he,
 since it is unavoidable, lets her have her way, though his heart grieves
 to give consent. he feels only reluctance now; but greater distress will
 be his when it is time to go to bed. the damsel, too, who leads him away,
 will pass through sorrow and heaviness. for it is possible that she will
 love him so that she will not wish to part with him. as soon as he had
 granted her wish and desire, she escorts him to a fortified place, than
 which there was none fairer in thessaly; for it was entirely enclosed by a
 high wall and a deep moat, and there was no man within except him whom she
 brought with her.
 (vv. -.) here she had constructed for her residence a quantity of
 handsome rooms, and a large and roomy hall. riding along a river bank,
 they approached their lodging-place, and a drawbridge was lowered to allow
 them to pass. crossing the bridge, they entered in, and found the hall
 open with its roof of tiles. through the open door they pass, and see a
 table laid with a broad white cloth, upon which the dishes were set, and
 the candles burning in their stands, and the gilded silver drinking-cups,
 and two pots of wine, one red and one white. standing beside the table, at
 the end of a bench, they found two basins of warm water in which to wash
 their hands, with a richly embroidered towel, all white and clean, with
 which to dry their hands. no valets, servants, or squires were to be found
 or seen. the knight, removing his shield from about his neck, hangs it
 upon a hook, and, taking his lance, lays it above upon a rack. then he
 dismounts from his horse, as does the damsel from hers. the knight, for
 his part, was pleased that she did not care to wait for him to help her to
 dismount. having dismounted, she runs directly to a room and brings him a
 short mantle of scarlet cloth which she puts on him. the hall was by no
 means dark; for beside the light from the stars, there were many large
 twisted candles lighted there, so that the illumination was very bright.
 when she had thrown the mantle about his shoulders, she said to him:
 "friend, here is the water and the towel; there is no one to present or
 offer it to you except me whom you see. wash your hands, and then sit
 down, when you feel like doing so. the hour and the meal, as you can see,
 demand that you should do so." he washes, and then gladly and readily
 takes his seat, and she sits down beside him, and they eat and drink
 together, until the time comes to leave the table.
 (vv. -.) when they had risen from the table, the damsel said to
 the knight: "sire, if you do not object, go outside and amuse yourself;
 but, if you please, do not stay after you think i must be in bed. feel no
 concern or embarrassment; for then you may come to me at once, if you will
 keep the promise you have made." and he replies: "i will keep my word, and
 will return when i think the time has come." then he went out, and stayed
 in the courtyard until he thought it was time to return and keep the
 promise he had made. going back into the hall, he sees nothing of her who
 would be his mistress; for she was not there. not finding or seeing her,
 he said: "wherever she may be, i shall look for her until i find her." he
 makes no delay in his search, being bound by the promise he had made her.
 entering one of the rooms, he hears a damsel cry aloud, and it was the
 very one with whom he was about to lie. at the same time, he sees the door
 of another room standing open, and stepping toward it, he sees right
 before his eyes a knight who had thrown her down, and was holding her
 naked and prostrate upon the bed. she, thinking that he had come of course
 to help her, cried aloud: "help, help, thou knight, who art my guest. if
 thou dost not take this man away from me, i shall find no one to do so; if
 thou dost not succour me speedily, he will wrong me before thy eyes. thou
 art the one to lie with me, in accordance with thy promise; and shall this
 man by force accomplish his wish before thy eyes? gentle knight, exert
 thyself, and make haste to bear me aid." he sees that the other man held
 the damsel brutally uncovered to the waist, and he is ashamed and angered
 to see him assault her so; yet it is not jealousy he feels, nor will he be
 made a cuckold by him. at the door there stood as guards two knights
 completely armed and with swords drawn. behind them there stood four
 men-at-arms, each armed with an axe the sort with which you could split a
 cow down the back as easily as a root of juniper or broom. the knight
 hesitated at the door, and thought: "god, what can i do? i am engaged in
 no less an affair than the quest of queen guinevere. i ought not to have
 the heart of a hare, when for her sake i have engaged in such a quest. if
 cowardice puts its heart in me, and if i follow its dictates, i shall
 never attain what i seek. i am disgraced, if i stand here; indeed, i am
 ashamed even to have thought of holding back. my heart is very sad and
 oppressed: now i am so ashamed and distressed that i would gladly die for
 having hesitated here so long. i say it not in pride: but may god have
 mercy on me if i do not prefer to die honourably rather than live a life
 of shame! if my path were unobstructed, and if these men gave me leave to
 pass through without restraint, what honour would i gain? truly, in that
 case the greatest coward alive would pass through; and all the while i
 hear this poor creature calling for help constantly, and reminding me of
 my promise, and reproaching me with bitter taunts." then he steps to the
 door, thrusting in his head and shoulders; glancing up, he sees two swords
 descending. he draws back, and the knights could not check their strokes:
 they had wielded them with such force that the swords struck the floor,
 and both were broken in pieces. when he sees that the swords are broken,
 he pays less attention to the axes, fearing and dreading them much less.
 rushing in among them, he strikes first one guard in the side and then
 another. the two who are nearest him he jostles and thrusts aside,
 throwing them both down flat; the third missed his stroke at him, but the
 fourth, who attacked him, strikes him so that he cuts his mantle and
 shirt, and slices the white flesh on his shoulder so that the blood
 trickles down from the wound. but he, without delay, and without
 complaining of his wound, presses on more rapidly, until he strikes
 between the temples him who was assaulting his hostess. before he departs,
 he will try to keep his pledge to her. he makes him stand up reluctantly.
 meanwhile, he who had missed striking him comes at him as fast as he can
 and, raising his arm again, expects to split his head to the teeth with
 the axe. but the other, alert to defend himself, thrusts the knight toward
 him in such a way that he receives the axe just where the shoulder joins
 the neck, so that they are cleaved apart. then the knight seizes the axe,
 wresting it quickly from him who holds it; then he lets go the knight whom
 he still held, and looks to his own defence; for the knights from the
 door, and the three men with axes are all attacking him fiercely. so he
 leaped quickly between the bed and the wall, and called to them: "come on
 now, all of you. if there were thirty-seven of you, you would have all the
 fight you wish, with me so favourably placed; i shall never be overcome by
 you." and the damsel watching him, exclaimed: "by my eyes, you need have
 no thought of that henceforth where i am." then at once she dismisses the
 knights and the men-at-arms, who retire from there at once, without delay
 or objection. and the damsel continues: "sire you have well defended me
 against the men of my household. come now, and i'll lead you on." hand in
 hand they enter the hall, but he was not at all pleased, and would have
 willingly dispensed with her.
 (vv. -.) in the midst of the hall a bed had been set up, the
 sheets of which were by no means soiled, but were white and wide and well
 spread out. the bed was not of shredded straw or of coarse spreads. but a
 covering of two silk cloths had been laid upon the couch. the damsel lay
 down first, but without removing her chemise. he had great trouble in
 removing his hose and in untying the knots. he sweated with the trouble of
 it all; yet, in the midst of all the trouble, his promise impels and
 drives him on. is this then an actual force? yes, virtually so; for he
 feels that he is in duty bound to take his place by the damsel's side. it
 is his promise that urges him and dictates his act. so he lies down at
 once, but like her, he does not remove his shirt. he takes good care not
 to touch her; and when he is in bed, he turns away from her as far as
 possible, and speaks not a word to her, like a monk to whom speech is
 forbidden. not once does he look at her, nor show her any courtesy. why
 not? because his heart does not go out to her. she was certainly very fair
 and winsome, but not every one is pleased and touched by what is fair and
 winsome. the knight has only one heart, and this one is really no longer
 his, but has been entrusted to some one else, so that he cannot bestow it
 elsewhere. love, which holds all hearts beneath its sway, requires it to
 be lodged in a single place. all hearts? no, only those which it esteems.
 and he whom love deigns to control ought to prize himself the more. love
 prized his heart so highly that it constrained it in a special manner, and
 made him so proud of this distinction that i am not inclined to find fault
 with him, if he lets alone what love forbids, and remains fixed where it
 desires. the maiden clearly sees and knows that he dislikes her company
 and would gladly dispense with it, and that, having no desire to win her
 love, he would not attempt to woo her. so she said: "my lord, if you will
 not feel hurt, i will leave and return to bed in my own room, and you will
 be more comfortable. i do not believe that you are pleased with my company
 and society. do not esteem me less if i tell you what i think. now take
 your rest all night, for you have so well kept your promise that i have no
 right to make further request of you. so i commend you to god; and shall
 go away." thereupon she arises: the knight does not object, but rather
 gladly lets her go, like one who is the devoted lover of some one else;
 the damsel clearly perceived this, and went to her room, where she
 undressed completely and retired, saying to herself: "of all the knights i
 have ever known, i never knew a single knight whom i would value the third
 part of an angevin in comparison with this one. as i understand the case,
 he has on hand a more perilous and grave affair than any ever undertaken
 by a knight; and may god grant that he succeed in it." then she fell
 asleep, and remained in bed until the next day's dawn appeared.
 (vv. -.) at daybreak she awakes and gets up. the knight awakes
 too, dressing, and putting on his arms, without waiting for any help. then
 the damsel comes and sees that he is already dressed. upon seeing him, she
 says: "may this day be a happy one for you." "and may it be the same to
 you, damsel," the knight replies, adding that he is waiting anxiously for
 some one to bring out his horse. the maiden has some one fetch the horse,
 and says: "sire, i should like to accompany you for some distance along
 the road, if you would agree to escort and conduct me according to the
 customs and practices which were observed before we were made captive in
 the kingdom of logres." in those days the customs and privileges were such
 that, if a knight found a damsel or lorn maid alone, and if he cared for
 his fair name, he would no more treat her with dishonour than he would cut
 his own throat. and if he assaulted her, he would be disgraced for ever in
 every court. but if, while she was under his escort, she should be won at
 arms by another who engaged him in battle, then this other knight might do
 with her what he pleased without receiving shame or blame. this is why the
 damsel said she would go with him, if he had the courage and willingness
 to safe guard her in his company, so that no one should do her any harm.
 and he says to her: "no one shall harm you, i promise you, unless he harm
 me first." "then," she says, "i will go with you." she orders her palfrey
 to be saddled, and her command is obeyed at once. her palfrey was brought
 together with the knight's horse. without the aid of any squire, they both
 mount, and rapidly ride away. she talks to him, but not caring for her
 words, he pays no attention to what she says. he likes to think, but
 dislikes to talk. love very often inflicts afresh the wound it has given
 him. yet, he applied no poultice to the wound to cure it and make it
 comfortable, having no intention or desire to secure a poultice or to seek
 a physician, unless the wound becomes more painful. yet, there is one
 whose remedy he would gladly seek ....  they
 follow the roads and paths in the right direction until they come to a
 spring, situated in the middle of a field, and bordered by a stone basin.
 some one had forgotten upon the stone a comb of gilded ivory. never since
 ancient times has wise man or fool seen such a comb. in its teeth there
 was almost a handful of hair belonging to her who had used the comb.
 (vv. -.) when the damsel notices the spring, and sees the stone,
 she does not wish her companion to see it; so she turns off in another
 direction. and he, agreeably occupied with his own thoughts, does not at
 once remark that she is leading him aside; but when at last he notices it,
 he is afraid of being beguiled, thinking that she is yielding and is going
 out of the way in order to avoid some danger. "see here, damsel," he
 cries, "you are not going right; come this way! no one, i think, ever went
 straight who left this road." "sire, this is a better way for us," the
 damsel says, "i am sure of it." then he replies to her: "i don't know,
 damsel, what you think; but you can plainly see that the beaten path lies
 this way; and since i have started to follow it, i shall not turn aside.
 so come now, if you will, for i shall continue along this way." then they
 go forward until they come near the stone basin and see the comb. the
 knight says: "i surely never remember to have seen so beautiful a comb as
 this." "let me have it," the damsel says. "willingly, damsel," he replies.
 then he stoops over and picks it up. while holding it, he looks at it
 steadfastly, gazing at the hair until the damsel begins to laugh. when he
 sees her doing so, he begs her to tell him why she laughs. and she says:
 "never mind, for i will never tell you." "why not?" he asks. "because i
 don't wish to do so." and when he hears that, he implores her like one who
 holds that lovers ought to keep faith mutually: "damsel, if you love
 anything passionately, by that i implore and conjure and beg you not to
 conceal from me the reason why you laugh." "your appeal is so strong," she
 says, "that i will tell you and keep nothing back. i am sure, as i am of
 anything, that this comb belonged to the queen. and you may take my word
 that those are strands of the queen's hair which you see to be so fair and
 light and radiant, and which are clinging in the teeth of the comb; they
 surely never grew anywhere else." then the knight replied: "upon my word,
 there are plenty of queens and kings; what queen do you mean?" and she
 answered: "in truth, fair sire, it is of king arthur's wife i speak." when
 he hears that, he has not strength to keep from bowing his head over his
 saddle-bow. and when the damsel sees him thus, she is amazed and
 terrified, thinking he is about to fall. do not blame her for her fear,
 for she thought him in a faint. he might as well have swooned, so near was
 he to doing so; for in his heart he felt such grief that for a long time
 he lost his colour and power of speech. and the damsel dismounts, and runs
 as quickly as possible to support and succour him; for she would not have
 wished for anything to see him fall. when he saw her, he felt ashamed, and
 said: "why do you need to bear me aid?" you must not suppose that the
 damsel told him why; for he would have been ashamed and distressed, and it
 would have annoyed and troubled him, if she had confessed to him the
 truth. so she took good care not to tell the truth, but tactfully answered
 him: "sire, i dismounted to get the comb; for i was so anxious to hold it
 in my hand that i could not longer wait." willing that she should have the
 comb, he gives it to her, first pulling out the hair so carefully that he
 tears none of it. never will the eye of man see anything receive such
 honour as when he begins to adore these tresses. a hundred thousand times
 he raises them to his eyes and mouth, to his forehead and face: he
 manifests his joy in every way, considering himself rich and happy now. he
 lays them in his bosom near his heart, between the shirt and the flesh. he
 would not exchange them for a cartload of emeralds and carbuncles, nor
 does he think that any sore or illness can afflict him now; he holds in
 contempt essence of pearl, treacle, and the cure for pleurisy; 
 even for st. martin and st. james he has no need; for he has such
 confidence in this hair that he requires no other aid. but what was this
 hair like? if i tell the truth about it, you will think i am a mad teller
 of lies. when the mart is full at the yearly fair of st. denis, 
 and when the goods are most abundantly displayed, even then the knight
 would not take all this wealth, unless he had found these tresses too. and
 if you wish to know the truth, gold a hundred thousand times refined, and
 melted down as many times, would be darker than is night compared with the
 brightest summer day we have had this year, if one were to see the gold
 and set it beside this hair. but why should i make a long story of it? the
 damsel mounts again with the comb in her possession; while he revels and
 delights in the tresses in his bosom. leaving the plain, they come to a
 forest and take a short cut through it until they come to a narrow place,
 where they have to go in single file; for it would have been impossible to
 ride two horses abreast. just where the way was narrowest, they see a
 knight approach. as soon as she saw him, the damsel recognised him, and
 said: "sir knight, do you see him who yonder comes against us all armed
 and ready for a battle? i know what his intention is: he thinks now that
 he cannot fail to take me off defenceless with him. he loves me, but he is
 very foolish to do so. in person, and by messenger, he has been long
 wooing me. but my love is not within his reach, for i would not love him
 under any consideration, so help me god! i would kill myself rather than
 bestow my love on him. i do not doubt that he is delighted now, and is as
 satisfied as if he had me already in his power. but now i shall see what
 you can do, and i shall see how brave you are, and it will become apparent
 whether your escort can protect me. if you can protect me now, i shall not
 fail to proclaim that you are brave and very worthy." and he answered her:
 "go on, go on!" which was as much as to say: "i am not concerned; there is
 no need of your being worried about what you have said."
 (vv. -.) while they were proceeding, talking thus, the knight, who
 was alone, rode rapidly toward them on the run. he was the more eager to
 make haste, because he felt more sure of success; he felt that he was
 lucky now to see her whom he most dearly loves. as soon as he approaches
 her, he greets her with words that come from his heart: "welcome to her,
 whence-soever she comes, whom i most desire, but who has hitherto caused
 me least joy and most distress!" it is not fitting that she should be so
 stingy of her speech as not to return his greeting, at least by word of
 mouth. the knight is greatly elated when the damsel greets him; though she
 does not take the words seriously, and the effort costs her nothing. yet,
 if he had at this moment been victor in a tournament, he would not have so
 highly esteemed himself, nor thought he had won such honour and renown.
 being now more confident of his worth, he grasped the bridle rein, and
 said: "now i shall lead you away: i have to-day sailed well on my course
 to have arrived at last at so good a port. now my troubles are at an end:
 after dangers, i have reached a haven; after sorrow, i have attained
 happiness; after pain, i have perfect health; now i have accomplished my
 desire, when i find you in such case that i can without resistance lead
 you away with me at once." then she says: "you have no advantage; for i am
 under this knight's escort." "surely, the escort is not worth much," he
 says, "and i am going to lead you off at once. this knight would have time
 to eat a bushel of salt before he could defend you from me; i think i
 could never meet a knight from whom i should not win you. and since i find
 you here so opportunely, though he too may do his best to prevent it, yet
 i will take you before his very eyes, however disgruntled he may be." the
 other is not angered by all the pride he hears expressed, but without any
 impudence or boasting, he begins thus to challenge him for her: "sire,
 don't be in a hurry, and don't waste your words, but speak a little
 reasonably. you shall not be deprived of as much of her as rightly belongs
 to you. you must know, however, that the damsel has come hither under my
 protection. let her alone now, for you have detained her long enough!" the
 other gives them leave to burn him, if he does not take her away in spite
 of him. then the other says: "it would not be right for me to let you take
 her away; i would sooner fight with you. but if we should wish to fight,
 we could not possibly do it in this narrow road. let us go to some level
 place—a meadow or an open field." and he replies that that will suit
 him perfectly: "certainly, i agree to that: you are quite right, this road
 is too narrow. my horse is so much hampered here that i am afraid he will
 crush his flank before i can turn him around." then with great difficulty
 he turns, and his horse escapes without any wound or harm. then he says:
 "to be sure, i am much chagrined that we have not met in a favourable spot
 and in the presence of other men, for i should have been glad to have them
 see which is the better of us two. come on now, let us begin our search:
 we shall find in the vicinity some large, broad, and open space." then
 they proceed to a meadow, where there were maids, knights, and damsels
 playing at divers games in this pleasant place. they were not all engaged
 in idle sport, but were playing backgammon and chess or dice, and were
 evidently agreeably employed. most were engaged in such games as these;
 but the others there were engaged in sports, dancing, singing, tumbling,
 leaping, and wrestling with each other.
 (vv. -.) a knight somewhat advanced in years was on the other side
 of the meadow, seared upon a sorrel spanish steed. his bridle and saddle
 were of gold, and his hair was turning grey. one hand hung at his side
 with easy grace. the weather being fine, he was in his shirt sleeves, with
 a short mantle of scarlet cloth and fur slung over his shoulders, and thus
 he watched the games and dances. on the other side of the field, close by
 a path, there were twenty-three knights mounted on good irish steeds. as
 soon as the three new arrivals come into view, they all cease their play
 and shout across the fields: "see, yonder comes the knight who was driven
 in the cart! let no one continue his sport while he is in our midst. a
 curse upon him who cares or deigns to play so long as he is here!"
 meanwhile he who loved the damsel and claimed her as his own, approached
 the old knight, and said: "sire, i have attained great happiness; let all
 who will now hear me say that god has granted me the thing that i have
 always most desired; his gift would not have been so great had he crowned
 me as king, nor would i have been so indebted to him, nor would i have so
 profited; for what i have gained is fair and good." "i know not yet if it
 be thine," the knight replies to his son. but the latter answers him:
 "don't you know? can't you see it, then? for god's sake, sire, have no
 further doubt, when you see that i have her in my possession. in this
 forest, whence i come, i met her as she was on her way. i think god had
 fetched her there for me, and i have taken her for my own." "i do not know
 whether this will be allowed by him whom i see coming after thee; he looks
 as if he is coming to demand her of thee." during this conversation the
 dancing had ceased because of the knight whom they saw, nor were they
 gaily playing any more because of the disgust and scorn they felt for him.
 but the knight without delay came up quickly after the damsel, and said:
 "let the damsel alone, knight, for you have no right to her! if you dare,
 i am willing at once to fight with you in her defence." then the old
 knight remarked: "did i not know it? fair son, detain the damsel no
 longer, but let her go." he does not relish this advice, and swears that
 he will not give her up: "may god never grant me joy if i give her up to
 him! i have her, and i shall hold on to her as something that is mine own.
 the shoulder-strap and all the armlets of my shield shall first be broken,
 and i shall have lost all confidence in my strength and arms, my sword and
 lance, before i will surrender my mistress to him." and his father says:
 "i shall not let thee fight for any reason thou mayest urge. thou art too
 confident of thy bravery. so obey my command." but he in his pride
 replies: "what? am i a child to be terrified? rather will i make my boast
 that there is not within the sea-girt land any knight, wheresoever he may
 dwell, so excellent that i would let him have her, and whom i should not
 expect speedily to defeat." the father answers: "fair son, i do not doubt
 that thou dost really think so, for thou art so confident of thy strength.
 but i do not wish to see thee enter a contest with this knight." then he
 replies: "i shall be disgraced if i follow your advice. curse me if i heed
 your counsel and turn recreant because of you, and do not do my utmost in
 the fight. it is true that a man fares ill among his relatives: i could
 drive a better bargain somewhere else, for you are trying to take me in. i
 am sure that where i am not known, i could act with better grace. no one,
 who did not know me, would try to thwart my will; whereas you are annoying
 and tormenting me. i am vexed by your finding fault with me. you know well
 enough that when any one is blamed, he breaks out still more passionately.
 but may god never give me joy if i renounce my purpose because of you;
 rather will i fight in spite of you!" "by the faith i bear the apostle st.
 peter," his father says, "now i see that my request is of no avail. i
 waste my time in rebuking thee; but i shall soon devise such means as
 shall compel thee against thy will to obey my commands and submit to
 them." straightway summoning all the knights to approach, he bids them lay
 hands upon his son whom he cannot correct, saying: "i will have him bound
 rather than let him fight. you here are all my men, and you owe me your
 devotion and service: by all the fiefs you hold from me, i hold you
 responsible, and i add my prayer. it seems to me that he must be mad, and
 that he shows excessive pride, when he refuses to respect my will." then
 they promise to take care of him, and say that never, while he is in their
 charge, shall he wish to fight, but that he must renounce the damsel in
 spite of himself. then they all join and seize him by the arms and neck.
 "dost thou not think thyself foolish now?" his father asks; "confess the
 truth: thou hast not the strength or power to fight or joust, however
 distasteful and hard it may be for thee to admit it. thou wilt be wise to
 consent to my will and pleasure. dost thou know what my intention is? in
 order somewhat to mitigate thy disappointment, i am willing to join thee,
 if thou wilt, in following the knight to-day and to-morrow, through wood
 and plain, each one mounted on his horse. perhaps we shall soon find him
 to be of such a character and bearing that i might let thee have thy way
 and fight with him." to this proposal the other must perforce consent.
 like the man who has no alternative, he says that he will give in,
 provided they both shall follow him. and when the people in the field see
 how this adventure has turned out, they all exclaim: "did you see? he who
 was mounted on the cart has gained such honour here that he is leading
 away the mistress of the son of my lord, and he himself is allowing it. we
 may well suppose that he finds in him some merit, when he lets him take
 her off. now cursed a hundred times be he who ceases longer his sport on
 his account! come, let us go back to our games again." then they resume
 their games and dances.
 (vv. -.) thereupon the knight turns away, without longer remaining
 in the field, and the damsel accompanies him. they leave in haste, while
 the father and his son ride after them through the mown fields until
 toward three o'clock, when in a very pleasant spot they come upon a
 church; beside the chancel there was a cemetery enclosed by a wall. the
 knight was both courteous and wise to enter the church on foot and make
 his prayer to god, while the damsel held his horse for him until he
 returned. when he had made his prayer, and while he was coming back, a
 very old monk suddenly presented himself; whereupon the knight politely
 requests him to tell him what this place is; for he does not know. and he
 tells him it is a cemetery. and the other says: "take me in, so help you
 god!" "gladly, sire," and he takes him in. following the monk's lead, the
 knight beholds the most beautiful tombs that one could find as far as
 dombes 
 or pampelune; and on each tomb there were letters cut, telling the names
 of those who were destined to be buried there. and he began in order to
 read the names, and came upon some which said: "here gawain is to lie,
 here louis, and here yvain." after these three, he read the names of many
 others among the most famed and cherished knights of this or any other
 land. among the others, he finds one of marble, which appears to be new,
 and is more rich and handsome than all the rest. calling the monk, the
 knight inquired: "of what use are these tombs here?" and the monk replied:
 "you have already read the inscriptions; if you have understood, you must
 know what they say, and what is the meaning of the tombs." "now tell me,
 what is this large one for?" and the hermit answered: "i will tell you.
 that is a very large sarcophagus, larger than any that ever was made; one
 so rich and well-carved was never seen. it is magnificent without, and
 still more so within. but you need not be concerned with that, for it can
 never do you any good; you will never see inside of it; for it would
 require seven strong men to raise the lid of stone, if any one wished to
 open it. and you may be sure that to raise it would require seven men
 stronger than you and i. there is an inscription on it which says that any
 one who can lift this stone of his own unaided strength will set free all
 the men and women who are captives in the land, whence no slave or noble
 can issue forth, unless he is a native of that land. no one has ever come
 back from there, but they are detained in foreign prisons; whereas they of
 the country go and come in and out as they please." at once the knight
 goes to grasp the stone, and raises it without the slightest trouble, more
 easily than ten men would do who exerted all their strength. and the monk
 was amazed, and nearly fell down at the sight of this marvellous thing;
 for he thought he would never see the like again, and said: "sire, i am
 very anxious to know your name. will you tell me what it is?" "not i,"
 says the knight, "upon my word." "i am certainly sorry, for that," he
 says; "but if you would tell me, you would do me a great favour, and might
 benefit yourself. who are you, and where do you come from?" "i am a
 knight, as you may see, and i was born in the kingdom of logre. after so
 much information, i should prefer to be excused. now please tell me, for
 your part, who is to lie within this tomb." "sire, he who shall deliver
 all those who are held captive in the kingdom whence none escapes." and
 when he had told him all this, the knight commended him to god and all his
 saints. and then, for the first time, he felt free to return to the
 damsel. the old white-haired monk escorts him out of the church, and they
 resume their way. while the damsel is mounting, however, the hermit
 relates to her all that the knight had done inside, and then he begged her
 to tell him, if she knew, what his name was; but she assured him that she
 did not know, but that there was one sure thing she could say, namely,
 that there was not such a knight alive where the four winds of heaven
 blow.
 (vv. -.) then the damsel takes leave of him, and rides swiftly
 after the knight. then those who were following them come up and see the
 hermit standing alone before the church. the old knight in his shirt
 sleeves said: "sire, tell us, have you seen a knight with a damsel in his
 company?" and he replies: "i shall not be loath to tell you all i know,
 for they have just passed on from here. the knight was inside yonder, and
 did a very marvellous thing in raising the stone from the huge marble
 tomb, quite unaided and without the least effort. he is bent upon the
 rescue of the queen, and doubtless he will rescue her, as well as all the
 other people. you know well that this must be so, for you have often read
 the inscription upon the stone. no knight was ever born of man and woman,
 and no knight ever sat in a saddle, who was the equal of this man." then
 the father turns to his son, and says: "son, what dost thou think about
 him now? is he not a man to be respected who has performed such a feat?
 now thou knowest who was wrong, and whether it was thou or i. i would not
 have thee fight with him for all the town of amiens; and yet thou didst
 struggle hard, before any one could dissuade thee from thy purpose. now we
 may as well go back, for we should be very foolish to follow him any
 farther." and he replies: "i agree to that. it would be useless to follow
 him. since it is your pleasure, let us return." they were very wise to
 retrace their steps. and all the time the damsel rides close beside the
 knight, wishing to compel him to give heed to her. she is anxious to learn
 his name, and she begs and beseeches him again and again to tell her,
 until in his annoyance he answers her: "have i not already told you that i
 belong in king arthur's realm? i swear by god and his goodness that you
 shall not learn my name." then she bids him give her leave to go, and she
 will turn back, which request he gladly grants.
 (vv. -.) thereupon the damsel departs, and he rides on alone until
 it grew very late. after vespers, about compline, as he pursued his way,
 he saw a knight returning from the wood where he had been hunting. with
 helmet unlaced, he rode along upon his big grey hunter, to which he had
 tied the game which god had permitted him to take. this gentleman came
 quickly to meet the knight, offering him hospitality. "sire," he says,
 "night will soon be here. it is time for you to be reasonable and seek a
 place to spend the night. i have a house of mine near at hand, whither i
 shall take you. no one ever lodged you better than i shall do, to the
 extent of my resources: i shall be very glad, if you consent." "for my
 part, i gladly accept," he says. the gentleman at once sends his son
 ahead, to prepare the house and start the preparations for supper. the lad
 willingly executes his command forthwith, and goes off at a rapid pace,
 while the others, who are in no haste, follow the road leisurely until
 they arrive at the house. the gentleman's wife was a very accomplished
 lady; and he had five sons, whom he dearly loved, three of them mere lads,
 and two already knights; and he had two fair and charming daughters, who
 were still unmarried. they were not natives of the land, but were there in
 durance, having been long kept there as prisoners away from their native
 land of logres. when the gentleman led the knight into his yard, the lady
 with her sons and daughters jumped up and ran to meet them, vying in their
 efforts to do him honour, as they greeted him and helped him to dismount.
 neither the sisters nor the five brothers paid much attention to their
 father, for they knew well enough that he would have it so. they honoured
 the knight and welcomed him; and when they had relieved him of his armour,
 one of his host's two daughters threw her own mantle about him, taking it
 from her own shoulders and throwing it about his neck. i do not need to
 tell how well he was served at supper; but when the meal was finished,
 they felt no further hesitation in speaking of various matters. first, the
 host began to ask him who he was, and from what land, but he did not
 inquire about his name. the knight promptly answered him: "i am from the
 kingdom of logres, and have never been in this land before." and when the
 gentleman heard that, he was greatly amazed, as were his wife and children
 too, and each one of them was sore distressed. then they began to say to
 him: "woe that you have come here, fair sire, for only trouble will come
 of it! for, like us, you will be reduced to servitude and exile." "where
 do you come from, then?" he asked. "sire, we belong in your country. many
 men from your country are held in servitude in this land. cursed be the
 custom, together with those who keep it up! no stranger comes here who is
 not compelled to stay here in the land where he is detained. for whoever
 wishes may come in, but once in, he has to stay. about your own fate, you
 may be at rest, you will doubtless never escape from here." he replies:
 "indeed, i shall do so, if possible." to this the gentleman replies: "how?
 do you think you can escape?" "yes, indeed, if it be god's will; and i
 shall do all within my power." "in that case, doubtless all the rest would
 be set free; for, as soon as one succeeds in fairly escaping from this
 durance, then all the rest may go forth unchallenged." then the gentleman
 recalled that he had been told and informed that a knight of great
 excellence was making his way into the country to seek for the queen, who
 was held by the king's son, meleagant; and he said to himself: "upon my
 word, i believe it is he, and i'll tell him so." so he said to him: "sire,
 do not conceal from me your business, if i promise to give you the best
 advice i know. i too shall profit by any success you may attain. reveal to
 me the truth about your errand, that it may be to your advantage as well
 as mine. i am persuaded that you have come in search of the queen into
 this land and among these heathen people, who are worse than the
 saracens." and the knight replies: "for no other purpose have i come. i
 know not where my lady is confined, but i am striving hard to rescue her,
 and am in dire need of advice. give me any counsel you can." and he says:
 "sire, you have undertaken a very grievous task. the road you are
 travelling will lead you straight to the sword-bridge. 
 you surely need advice. if you would heed my counsel, you would proceed to
 the sword-bridge by a surer way, and i would have you escorted thither."
 then he, whose mind is fixed upon the most direct way, asks him: "is the
 road of which you speak as direct as the other way?" "no, it is not," he
 says; "it is longer, but more sure." then he says: "i have no use for it;
 tell me about this road i am following!" "i am ready to do so," he
 replies; "but i am sure you will not fare well if you take any other than
 the road i recommend. to-morrow you will reach a place where you will have
 trouble: it is called 'the stony passage'. shall i tell you how bad a
 place it is to pass? only one horse can go through at a time; even two men
 could not pass abreast, and the passage is well guarded and defended. you
 will meet with resistance as soon as you arrive. you will sustain many a
 blow of sword and lance, and will have to return full measure before you
 succeed in passing through." and when he had completed the account, one of
 the gentleman's sons, who was a knight, stepped forward, saying: "sire, if
 you do not object, i will go with this gentleman." then one of the lads
 jumps up, and says: "i too will go." and the father gladly gives them both
 consent. now the knight will not have to go alone, and he expresses his
 gratitude, being much pleased with the company.
 (vv. -.) then the conversation ceases, and they take the knight to
 bed, where he was glad to fall asleep. as soon as daylight was visible he
 got up, and those who were to accompany him got up too. the two knights
 donned their armour and took their leave, while the young fellow started
 on ahead. together they pursued their way until they came at the hour of
 prime to "the stony passage." in the middle of it they found a wooden
 tower, where there was always a man on guard. before they drew near, he
 who was on the tower saw them and cried twice aloud: "woe to this man who
 comes!" and then behold! a knight issued from the tower, mounted and armed
 with fresh armour, and escorted on either side by servants carrying sharp
 axes. then, when the other draws near the passage, he who defends it
 begins to heap him with abuse about the cart, saying: "vassal, thou art
 bold and foolish, indeed, to have entered this country. no man ought ever
 to come here who had ridden upon a cart, and may god withhold from him his
 blessing!" then they spur toward each other at the top of their horses'
 speed. and he who was to guard the passage-way at once breaks his lance
 and lets the two pieces fall; the other strikes him in the neck, reaching
 him beneath the shield, and throws him over prostrate upon the stones.
 then the servants come forward with the axes, but they intentionally fail
 to strike him, having no desire to harm or damage him; so he does not
 deign to draw his sword, and quickly passes on with his companions. one of
 them remarks to the other: "no one has ever seen so good a knight, nor has
 he any equal. is not this a marvellous thing, that he has forced a passage
 here?" and the knight says to his brother: "fair brother, for god's sake,
 make haste to go and tell our father of this adventure." but the lad
 asserts and swears that he will not go with the message, and will never
 leave the knight until he has dubbed and knighted him; let his brother go
 with the message, if he is so much concerned.
 (vv. -.) then they go on together until about three o'clock, when
 they come upon a man, who asks them who they are. and they answer: "we are
 knights, busy about our own affairs." then the man says to the knight:
 "sire, i should be glad to offer hospitality to you and your companions
 here." this invitation he delivers to him whom he takes to be the lord and
 master of the others. and this one replies to him: "i could not seek
 shelter for the night at such an hour as this; for it is not well to tarry
 and seek one's ease when one has undertaken some great task. and i have
 such business on hand that i shall not stop for the night for some time
 yet." then the man continues: "my house is not near here, but is some
 distance ahead. it will be late when you reach there, so you may proceed,
 assured that you will find a place to lodge just when it suits you." "in
 that case," he says, "i will go thither." thereupon the man starts ahead
 as guide, and the knight follows along the path. and when they had
 proceeded some distance, they met a squire who was coming along at a
 gallop, mounted upon a nag that was as fat and round as an apple. and the
 squire calls our to the man: "sire, sire, make haste! for the people of
 logres have attacked in force the inhabitants of this land, and war and
 strife have already broken out; and they say that this country has been
 invaded by a knight who has been in many battles, and that wherever he
 wishes to go, no one, however reluctantly, is able to deny him passage.
 and they further say that he will deliver those who are in this country,
 and will subdue our people. now take my advice and make haste!" then the
 man starts at a gallop, and the others are greatly delighted at the words
 they have heard, for they are eager to help their side. and the vavasor's
 son says: "hear what this squire says! come and let us aid our people who
 are fighting their enemies!" meanwhile the man rides off, without waiting
 for them, and makes his way rapidly toward a fortress which stood upon a
 fortified hill; thither he hastens, till he comes to the gate, while the
 others spur after him. the castle was surrounded by a high wall and moat.
 as soon as they had got inside, a gate was lowered upon their heels, so
 that they could not get out again. then they say: "come on, come on! let
 us not stop here!" and they rapidly pursue the man until they reach
 another gate which was not closed against them. but as soon as the man had
 passed through, a portcullis dropped behind him. then the others were much
 dismayed to see themselves shut in, and they think they must be bewitched.
 but he, of whom i have more to tell, wore upon his finger a ring, whose
 stone was of such virtue that any one who gazed at it was freed from the
 power of enchantment.  holding the ring before his
 eyes, he gazed at it, and said: "lady, lady, so help me god, now i have
 great need of your succour!"  this lady was a fairy, who had
 given it to him, and who had cared for him in his infancy. and he had
 great confidence that, wherever he might be, she would aid and succour
 him. but after appealing to her and gazing upon the ring, he realises that
 there is no enchantment here, but that they are actually shut in and
 confined. then they come to the barred door of a low and narrow postern
 gate. drawing their swords, they all strike it with such violence that
 they cut the bar. as soon as they were outside the tower, they see that a
 fierce strife was already begun down in the meadows, and that there are at
 least a thousand knights engaged, beside the low-bred infantry. while they
 were descending to the plain, the wise and moderate son of the vavasor
 remarked: "sire, before we arrive upon the field, it would be wise for us,
 it seems to me, to find out and learn on which side our people are. i do
 not know where they are placed, but i will go and find out, if you wish it
 so." "i wish you would do so," he replies, "go quickly, and do not fail to
 come back again at once." he goes and returns at once, saying: "it has
 turned out well for us, for i have plainly seen that these are our troops
 on this side of the field." then the knight at once rode into the fight
 and jousted with a knight who was approaching him, striking him in the eye
 with such violence that he knocked him lifeless to the ground. then the
 lad dismounts, and taking the dead knight's horse and arms, he arms
 himself with skill and cleverness. when he was armed, he straightway
 mounts, taking the shield and the lance, which was heavy, stiff, and
 decorated, and about his waist he girt a sharp, bright, and flashing
 sword. then he followed his brother and lord into the fight. the latter
 demeaned himself bravely in the melee for some time, breaking, splitting,
 and crushing shields, helmets and hauberks. no wood or steel protected the
 man whom he struck; he either wounded him or knocked him lifeless from the
 horse. unassisted, he did so well that he discomfited all whom he met,
 while his companions did their part as well. the people of logres, not
 knowing him, are amazed at what they see, and ask the vavasor's sons about
 the stranger knight. this reply is made to them: "gentlemen, this is he
 who is to deliver us all from durance and misery, in which we have so long
 been confined, and we ought to do him great honour when, to set us free,
 he has passed through so many perils and is ready to face many more. he
 has done much, and will do yet more." every one is overjoyed at hearing
 this welcome news. the news travelled fast, and was noised about, until it
 was known by all. their strength and courage rise, so that they slay many
 of those still alive, and apparently because of the example of a single
 knight they work greater havoc than because of all the rest combined. and
 if it had not been so near evening, all would have gone away defeated; but
 night came on so dark that they had to separate.
 (vv. -.) when the battle was over, all the captives pressed about
 the knight, grasping his rein on either side, and thus addressing him:
 "welcome, fair sire," and each one adds: "sire, for the name of god, do
 not fail to lodge with me!" what one says they all repeat, for young and
 old alike insist that he must lodge with them, saying: "you will be more
 comfortably lodged with me than with any one else." thus each one
 addresses him to his face, and in the desire to capture him, each one
 drags him from the rest, until they almost come to blows. then he tells
 them that they are very foolish and silly to struggle so. "cease this
 wrangling among yourselves, for it does no good to me or you. instead of
 quarrelling among ourselves, we ought rather to lend one another aid. you
 must not dispute about the privilege of lodging me, but rather consider
 how to lodge me in such a place that it may be to your general advantage,
 and that i may be advanced upon my way." then each one exclaims at once:
 "that is my house, or, no, it is mine," until the knight replies: "follow
 my advice and say nothing more; the wisest of you is foolish to contend
 this way. you ought to be concerned to further my affairs, and instead you
 are seeking to turn me aside. if you had each individually done me all the
 honour and service it is possible to do, and i had accepted your kindness,
 by all the saints of rome i swear that i could not be more obliged to you
 than i am now for your good-will. so may god give me joy and health, your
 good intentions please me as much as if each one of you had already shown
 me great honour and kindness: so let the will stand for the deed!" thus he
 persuades and appeases them all. then they take him quickly along the road
 to a knight's residence, where they seek to serve him: all rejoice to
 honour and serve him throughout the evening until bedtime, for they hold
 him very dear. next morning, when the time came to separate, each one
 offers and presents himself, with the desire to accompany him; but it is
 not his will or pleasure that any one shall go with him except the two
 whom he had brought with him. accompanied by them alone, he resumed his
 journey. that day they rode from morn till evening without encountering
 any adventure. when it was now very late, and while they were riding
 rapidly out of a forest, they saw a house belonging to a knight, and
 seated at the door they saw his wife, who had the bearing of a gentle
 lady. as soon as she espied them coming, she rose to her feet to meet
 them, and greeted them joyfully with a smile: "welcome! i wish you to
 accept my house; this is your lodging; pray dismount" "lady, since it is
 your will, we thank you, and will dismount; we accept your hospitality for
 the night." when they had dismounted, the lady had the horses taken by
 members of her well-ordered household. she calls her sons and daughters
 who come at once: the youths were courteous, handsome, and well-behaved,
 and the daughters were fair. she bids the lads remove the saddles and
 curry the horses well; no one refused to do this, but each carried out her
 instructions willingly. when she ordered the knights to be disarmed, her
 daughters step forward to perform this service. they remove their armour,
 and hand them three short mantles to put on. then at once they take them
 into the house which was very handsome. the master was not at home, being
 out in the woods with two of his sons. but he presently returned, and his
 household, which was well-ordered, ran to meet him outside the door.
 quickly they untie and unpack the game he brings, and tell him the news:
 "sire, sire, you do not know that you have three knights for guests." "god
 be praised for that," he says. then the knight and his two sons extend a
 glad welcome to their guests. the rest of the household were not backward,
 for even the least among them prepared to perform his special task. while
 some run to prepare the meal, others light the candles in profusion; still
 others get a towel and basins, and offer water for the hands: they are not
 niggardly in all this. when all had washed, they take their seats. nothing
 that was done there seemed to be any trouble or burdensome. but at the
 first course there came a surprise in the form of a knight outside the
 door. as he sat on his charger, all armed from head to feet, he looked
 prouder than a bull, and a bull is a yew proud beast. one leg was fixed in
 the stirrup, but the other he had thrown over the mane of his horse's
 neck, to give himself a careless and jaunty air. behold him advancing
 thus, though no one noticed him until he came forward with the words: "i
 wish to know which is the man who is so foolish and proud a numskull that
 he has come to this country and intends to cross the sword-bridge. all his
 pains will come to naught, and his expedition is in vain." then he, who
 felt no fear at all, thus replies with confidence: "i am he who intends to
 cross the bridge." "thou? thou? how didst thou dare to think of such a
 thing? before undertaking such a course, thou oughtest to have thought of
 the end that is in store for thee, and thou oughtest to have in mind the
 memory of the cart on which thou didst ride. i know not whether thou
 feelest shame for the ride thou hadst on it, but no sensible man would
 have embarked on such an enterprise as this if he had felt the reproach of
 his action."
 (vv. -.) not a word does he deign to reply to what he hears the
 other say; but the master of the house and all the others express their
 surprise openly: "ah, god, what a misfortune this is," each one of them
 says to himself; "cursed be the hour when first a cart was conceived or
 made! for it is a very vile and hateful thing. ah, god, of what was he
 accused? why was he carried in a cart? for what sin, or for what crime? he
 will always suffer the reproach. if he were only clear of this disgrace,
 no knight could be found in all the world, however his valour might be
 proved, who would equal the merit of this knight. if all good knights
 could be compared, and if the truth were to be known, you could find none
 so handsome or so expert." thus they expressed their sentiments. then he
 began his speech of impudence: "listen, thou knight, who art bound for the
 sword-bridge! if thou wishest, thou shalt cross the water very easily and
 comfortably. i will quickly have thee ferried over in a skiff. but once on
 the other side, i will make thee pay me toll, and i will take thy head, if
 i please to do so, or if not, thou shalt be held at my discretion." and he
 replies that he is not seeking trouble, and that he will never risk his
 head in such an adventure for any consideration. to which the other
 answers at once: "since thou wilt not do this, whosesoever the shame and
 loss may be, thou must come outside with me and there engage me hand to
 hand." then, to beguile him. the other says: "if i could refuse, i would
 very gladly excuse myself; but in truth i would rather fight than be
 compelled to do what is wrong." before he arose from the table where they
 were sitting, he told the youths who were serving him, to saddle his horse
 at once, and fetch his arms and give them to him. this order they promptly
 execute: some devote themselves to arming him, while others go to fetch
 his horse. as he slowly rode along completely armed, holding his shield
 tight by the straps, you must know that he was evidently to be included in
 the list of the brave and fair. his horse became him so well that it is
 evident he must be his own, and as for the shield he held by the straps
 and the helmet laced upon his head, which fitted him so well, you would
 never for a moment have thought that he had borrowed it or received it as
 a loan; rather, you would be so pleased with him that you would maintain
 that he had been thus born and raised: for all this i should like you to
 take my word.
 (vv. -.) outside the gate, where the battle was to be fought,
 there was a stretch of level ground well adapted for the encounter. when
 they catch sight of each other, they spur hotly to the attack and come
 together with such a shock, dealing such blows with their lances, that
 they first bend, then buckle up, and finally fly into splinters. with
 their swords they then hew away at their shields, helmets, and hauberks.
 the wood is cut and the steel gives way, so that they wound each other in
 several places. they pay each other such angry blows that it seems as if
 they had made a bargain. the swords often descend upon the horses' croups,
 where they drink and feast upon their blood; their riders strike them upon
 the flanks until at last they kill them both. and when both have fallen to
 earth, they attack each other afoot; and if they had cherished a mortal
 hatred, they could not have assailed each other more fiercely with their
 swords. they deal their blows with greater frequency than the man who
 stakes his money at dice and never fails to double the stakes every time
 he loses; yet, this game of theirs was very different; for there were no
 losses here, but only fierce blows and cruel strife. all the people came
 out from the house: the master, his lady, his sons and daughters; no man
 or woman, friend or stranger, stayed behind, but all stood in line to see
 the fight in progress in the broad, level field. the knight of the cart
 blames and reproaches himself for faintheartedness when he sees his host
 watching him and notices all the others looking on. his heart is stirred
 with anger, for it seems to him that he ought long since to have beaten
 his adversary. then he strikes him, rushing in like a storm and bringing
 his sword down close by his head; he pushes and presses him so hard that
 he drives him from his ground and reduces him to such a state of
 exhaustion that he has little strength to defend himself. then the knight
 recalls how the other had basely reproached him about the cart; so he
 assails him and drubs him so soundly that not a string or strap remains
 unbroken about the neck-band of his hauberk, and he knocks the helmet and
 ventail from his head. his wounds and distress are so great that he has to
 cry for mercy. just as the lark cannot withstand or protect itself against
 the hawk which outflies it and attacks it from above, so he in his
 helplessness and shame, must invoke him and sue for mercy. and when he
 hears him beg for mercy, he ceases his attack and says: "dost thou wish
 for mercy?" he replies: "you have asked a very clever question; any fool
 could ask that. i never wished for anything so much as i now wish for
 mercy." then he says to him: "thou must mount, then, upon a cart. nothing
 thou couldst say would have any influence with me, unless thou mountest
 the cart, to atone for the vile reproaches thou didst address to me with
 thy silly mouth." and the knight thus answers him: "may it never please
 god that i mount a cart!" "no?" he asks; "then you shall die." "sire, you
 can easily put me to death; but i beg and beseech you for god's sake to
 show me mercy and not compel me to mount a cart. i will agree to anything,
 however grievous, excepting that. i would rather die a hundred times than
 undergo such a disgrace. in your goodness and mercy you can tell me
 nothing so distasteful that i will not do it."
 (vv. -.) while he is thus beseeching him, behold across the field
 a maiden riding on a tawny mule, her head uncovered and her dress
 disarranged. in her hand she held a whip with which she belaboured the
 mule; and in truth no horse could have galloped so fast as was the pace of
 the mule. the damsel called out to the knight of the cart: "may god bless
 thy heart, sir knight, with whatever delights thee most!" and he, who
 heard her gladly, says: "may god bless you, damsel, and give you joy and
 health!" then she tells him of her desire. "knight," she says, "in urgent
 need i have come from afar to thee to ask a favour, for which thou wilt
 deserve the best guerdon i can make to thee; and i believe that thou wilt
 yet have need of my assistance." and he replies: "tell me what it is you
 wish; and if i have it, you shall have it at once, provided it be not
 something extravagant." then she says: "it is the head of the knight whom
 thou hast just defeated; in truth, thou hast never dealt with such a
 wicked and faithless man. thou wilt be committing no sin or wrong, but
 rather doing a deed of charity, for he is the basest creature that ever
 was or ever shall be." and when he who had been vanquished hears that she
 wishes him to be killed, he says to him: "don't believe her, for she hates
 me; but by that god who was at once father and son, and who chose for his
 mother her who was his daughter and handmaiden, i beg you to have mercy
 upon me!" "ah, knight!" the maid exclaims, "pay no attention to what this
 traitor says! may god give thee all the joy and honour to which thou dost
 aspire, and may he give thee good success in thy undertaking." then the
 knight is in a predicament, as he thinks and ponders over the question:
 whether to present to her the head she asks him to cut off, or whether he
 shall allow himself to be touched by pity for him.  he
 wishes to respect the wishes of both her and him. generosity and pity each
 command him to do their will; for he was both generous and tender-hearted.
 but if she carries off the head, then will pity be defeated and put to
 death; whereas, if she does not carry off the head, generosity will be
 discomfited. thus, pity and generosity hold him so confined and so
 distressed that he is tormented and spurred on by each of them in turn.
 the damsel asks him to give her the head, and on the other hand the knight
 makes his request, appealing to his pity and kindness. and, since he has
 implored him, shall he not receive mercy? yes, for it never happened that,
 when he had put down an enemy and compelled him to sue for mercy, he would
 refuse such an one his mercy or longer bear him any grudge. since this is
 his custom, he will not refuse his mercy to him who now begs and sues for
 it. and shall she have the head she covets? yes, if it be possible.
 "knight," he says, "it is necessary for thee to fight me again, and if
 thou dost care to defend thy head again, i will show thee such mercy as to
 allow thee to resume the helmet; and i will give thee time to arm thy body
 and thy head as well as possible. but, if i conquer thee again, know that
 thou shalt surely die." and he replies: "i desire nothing better than
 that, and ask for no further favour." "and i will give thee this
 advantage," he adds: "i will fight thee as i stand, without changing my
 present position." then the other knight makes ready, and they begin the
 fight again eagerly. but this time the knight triumphed more quickly than
 he had done at first. and the damsel at once cries out: "do not spare him,
 knight, for anything he may say to thee. surely he would not have spared
 thee, had he once defeated thee. if thou heedest what he says, be sure
 that he will again beguile thee. fair knight, cut off the head of the most
 faithless man in the empire and kingdom, and give it to me! thou shouldst
 present it to me, in view of the guerdon i intend for thee. for another
 day may well come when, if he can, he will beguile thee again with his
 words." he, thinking his end is near, cries aloud to him for mercy; but
 his cry is of no avail, nor anything that he can say. the other drags him
 by the helmet, tearing all the fastening, and he strikes from his head the
 ventail and the gleaming coif. then he cries out more loudly still:
 "mercy, for god's sake! mercy, sir!" but the other answers: "so help me, i
 shall never again show thee pity, after having once let thee off." "ah,"
 he says, "thou wouldst do wrong to heed my enemy and kill me thus." while
 she, intent upon his death, admonishes him to cut off his head, and not to
 believe a word he says. he strikes: the head flies across the sward and
 the body fails. then the damsel is pleased and satisfied. grasping the
 head by the hair, the knight presents it to the damsel, who takes it
 joyfully with the words: "may thy heart receive such delight from whatever
 it most desires as my heart now receives from what i most coveted. i had
 only one grief in life, and that was that this man was still alive. i have
 a reward laid up for thee which thou shalt receive at the proper time. i
 promise thee that thou shalt have a worthy reward for the service thou
 hast rendered me. now i will go away, with the prayer that god may guard
 thee from harm." then the damsel leaves him, as each commends the other to
 god. but all those who had seen the battle in the plain are overjoyed, and
 in their joy they at once relieve the knight of his armour, and honour him
 in every way they can. then they wash their hands again and take their
 places at the meal, which they eat with better cheer than is their wont.
 when they had been eating for some time, the gentleman turned to his guest
 at his side, and said: "sire, a long while ago we came hither from the
 kingdom of logres. we were born your countrymen, and we should like to see
 you win honour and fortune and joy in this country; for we should profit
 by it as well as you, and it would be to the advantage of many others, if
 you should gain honour and fortune in the enterprise you have undertaken
 in this land." and he makes answer: "may god hear your desire."
 (vv. -.) when the host had dropped his voice and ceased speaking,
 one of his sons followed him and said: "sire, we ought to place all our
 resources at your service, and give them outright rather than promise
 them; if you have any need of our assistance, we ought not to wait until
 you ask for it. sire, be not concerned over your horse which is dead. we
 have good strong horses here. i want you to take anything of ours which
 you need, and you shall choose the best of our horses in place of yours."
 and he replies: "i willingly accept." thereupon, they have the beds
 prepared and retire for the night. the next morning they rise early, and
 dress, after which they prepare to start. upon leaving, they fail in no
 act of courtesy, but take leave of the lady, her lord, and all the rest.
 but in order to omit nothing, i must remark that the knight was unwilling
 to mount the borrowed steed which was standing ready at the door; rather,
 he caused him to be ridden by one of the two knights who had come with
 him, while he took the latter's horse instead, for thus it pleased him
 best to do. when each was seated on his horse, they all asked for leave to
 depart from their host who had served them so honourably. then they ride
 along the road until the day draws to a close, and late in the afternoon
 they reach the sword-bridge.
 (vv. -.) at the end of this very difficult bridge they dismount
 from their steeds and gaze at the wicked-looking stream, which is as swift
 and raging, as black and turgid, as fierce and terrible as if it were the
 devil's stream; and it is so dangerous and bottomless that anything
 failing into it would be as completely lost as if it fell into the salt
 sea. and the bridge, which spans it, is different from any other bridge;
 for there never was such a one as this. if any one asks of me the truth,
 there never was such a bad bridge, nor one whose flooring was so bad. the
 bridge across the cold stream consisted of a polished, gleaming sword; but
 the sword was stout and stiff, and was as long as two lances. at each end
 there was a tree-trunk in which the sword was firmly fixed. no one need
 fear to fall because of its breaking or bending, for its excellence was
 such that it could support a great weight. but the two knights who were
 with the third were much discouraged; for they surmised that two lions or
 two leopards would be found tied to a great rock at the other end of the
 bridge. the water and the bridge and the lions combine so to terrify them
 that they both tremble with fear, and say: "fair sire, consider well what
 confronts you; for it is necessary and needful to do so. this bridge is
 badly made and built, and the construction of it is bad. if you do not
 change your mind in time, it will be too late to repent. you must consider
 which of several alternatives you will choose. suppose that you once get
 across (but that cannot possibly come to pass, any more than one could
 hold in the winds and forbid them to blow, or keep the birds from singing,
 or re-enter one's mother's womb and be born again—all of which is as
 impossible as to empty the sea of its water); but even supposing that you
 got across, can you think and suppose that those two fierce lions that are
 chained on the other side will not kill you, and suck the blood from your
 veins, and eat your flesh and then gnaw your bones? for my part, i am bold
 enough, when i even dare to look and gaze at them. if you do not take
 care, they will certainly devour you. your body will soon be torn and rent
 apart, for they will show you no mercy. so take pity on us now, and stay
 here in our company! it would be wrong for you to expose yourself
 intentionally to such mortal peril." and he, laughing, replies to them:
 "gentlemen, receive my thanks and gratitude for the concern you feel for
 me: it comes from your love and kind hearts. i know full well that you
 would not like to see any mishap come to me; but i have faith and
 confidence in god, that he will protect me to the end. i fear the bridge
 and stream no more than i fear this dry land; so i intend to prepare and
 make the dangerous attempt to cross. i would rather die than turn back
 now." the others have nothing more to say; but each weeps with pity and
 heaves a sigh. meanwhile he prepares, as best he may, to cross the stream,
 and he does a very marvellous thing in removing the armour from his feet
 and hands. he will be in a sorry state when he reaches the other side. he
 is going to support himself with his bare hands and feet upon the sword,
 which was sharper than a scythe, for he had not kept on his feet either
 sole or upper or hose. but he felt no fear of wounds upon his hands or
 feet; he preferred to maim himself rather than to fall from the bridge and
 be plunged in the water from which he could never escape. in accordance
 with this determination, he passes over with great pain and agony, being
 wounded in the hands, knees, and feet. but even this suffering is sweet to
 him: for love, who conducts and leads him on, assuages and relieves the
 pain. creeping on his hands, feet, and knees, he proceeds until he reaches
 the other side. then he recalls and recollects the two lions which he
 thought he had seen from the other side; but, on looking about, he does
 not see so much as a lizard or anything else to do him harm. he raises his
 hand before his face and looks at his ring, and by this test he proves
 that neither of the lions is there which he thought he had seen, and that
 he had been enchanted and deceived; for there was not a living creature
 there. when those who had remained behind upon the bank saw that he had
 safely crossed, their joy was natural; but they do not know of his
 injuries. he, however, considers himself fortunate not to have suffered
 anything worse. the blood from his wounds drips on his shirt on all sides.
 then he sees before him a tower, which was so strong that never had he
 seen such a strong one before: indeed, it could not have been a better
 tower. at the window there sat king bademagu, who was very scrupulous and
 precise about matters of honour and what was right, and who was careful to
 observe and practise loyalty above all else; and beside him stood his son,
 who always did precisely the opposite so far as possible, for he found his
 pleasure in disloyalty, and never wearied of villainy, treason, and
 felony. from their point of vantage they had seen the knight cross the
 bridge with trouble and pain. meleagant's colour changed with the rage and
 displeasure he felt; for he knows now that he will be challenged for the
 queen; but his character was such that he feared no man, however strong or
 formidable. if he were not base and disloyal, there could no better knight
 be found; but he had a heart of wood, without gentleness and pity. what
 enraged his son and roused his ire, made the king happy and glad. the king
 knew of a truth that he who had crossed the bridge was much better than
 any one else. for no one would dare to pass over it in whom there dwelt
 any of that evil nature which brings more shame upon those who possess it
 than prowess brings of honour to the virtuous. for prowess cannot
 accomplish so much as wickedness and sloth can do: it is true beyond a
 doubt that it is possible to do more evil than good.
 (vv. -.) i could say more on these two heads, if it did not cause
 me to delay. but i must turn to something else and resume my subject, and
 you shall hear how the king speaks profitably to his son: "son," he says,
 "it was fortunate that thou and i came to look out this window; our reward
 has been to witness the boldest deed that ever entered the mind of man.
 tell me now if thou art not well disposed toward him who has performed
 such a marvellous feat. make peace and be reconciled with him, and deliver
 the queen into his hands. thou shalt gain no glory in battle with him, but
 rather mayst thou incur great loss. show thyself to be courteous and
 sensible, and send the queen to meet him before he sees thee. show him
 honour in this land of thine, and before he asks it, present to him what
 he has come to seek. thou knowest well enough that he has come for the
 queen guinevere. do not act so that people will take thee to be obstinate,
 foolish, or proud. if this man has entered thy land alone, thou shouldst
 bear him company, for one gentleman ought not to avoid another, but rather
 attract him and honour him with courtesy. one receives honour by himself
 showing it; be sure that the honour will be thine, if thou doest honour
 and service to him who is plainly the best knight in the world." and he
 replies: "may god confound me, if there is not as good a knight, or even a
 better one than he!" it was too bad that he did not mention himself, of
 whom he entertains no mean opinion. and he adds: "i suppose you wish me to
 clasp my hands and kneel before him as his liegeman, and to hold my lands
 from him? so help me god, i would rather become his man than surrender to
 him the queen! god forbid that in such a fashion i should deliver her to
 him! she shall never be given up by me, but rather contested and defended
 against all who are so foolish as to dare to come in quest of her." then
 again the king says to him: "son, thou wouldst act very courteously to
 renounce this pretension. i advise thee and beg thee to keep the peace.
 thou knowest well that the honour will belong to the knight, if he wins
 the queen from thee in battle. he would doubtless rather win her in battle
 than as a gift, for it will thus enhance his fame. it is my opinion that
 he is seeking her, not to receive her peaceably, but because he wishes to
 win her by force of arms. so it would be wise on thy part to deprive him
 of the satisfaction of fighting thee. i am sorry to see thee so foolish;
 but if thou dost not heed my advice, evil will come of it, and the ensuing
 misfortune will be worse for thee. for the knight need fear no hostility
 from any one here save thee. on behalf of myself and all my men, i will
 grant him a truce and security. i have never yet done a disloyal deed or
 practised treason and felony, and i shall not begin to do so now on thy
 account any more than i would for any stranger. i do not wish to flatter
 thee, for i promise that the knight shall not lack any arms, or horse or
 anything else he needs, in view of the boldness he has displayed in coming
 thus far. he shall be securely guarded and well defended against all men
 here excepting thee. i wish him clearly to understand that, if he can
 maintain himself against thee, he need have no fear of any one else." "i
 have listened to you in silence long enough," says meleagant, "and you may
 say what you please. but little do i care for all you say. i am not a
 hermit, nor so compassionate and charitable, and i have no desire to be so
 honourable as to give him what i most love. his task will not be performed
 so quickly or so lightly; rather will it turn out otherwise than as you
 and he expect. you and i need not quarrel because you aid him against me.
 even if he enjoys peace and a truce with you and all your men, what
 matters that to me? my heart does not quail on that account; rather, so
 help me god, i am glad that he need not feel concern for any one here but
 me; i do not wish you to do on my account anything which might be
 construed as disloyalty or treachery. be as compassionate as you please,
 but let me be cruel." "what? wilt thou not change thy mind?" "no," he
 says. "then i will say nothing more. i will leave thee alone to do thy
 best and will go now to speak with the knight. i wish to offer and present
 to him my aid and counsel in all respects; for i am altogether on his
 side."
 (vv. -.) then the king goes down and orders them to bring his
 horse. a large steed is brought to him, upon which he springs by the
 stirrup, and he rides off with some of his men: three knights and two
 squires he bade to go with him. they did not stop their ride downhill
 until they came to the bridge, where they see him stanching his wounds and
 wiping the blood from them. the king expects to keep him as his guest for
 a long time while his wounds are healing; but he might as well expect to
 drain the sea. the king hastens to dismount, and he who was grievously
 wounded, stood up at once to meet him, though he did not know him, and he
 gave no more evidence of the pain he felt in his feet and hands than if he
 had been actually sound. the king sees that he is exerting himself, and
 quickly runs to greet him with the words: "sire, i am greatly amazed that
 you have fallen upon us in this land. but be welcome, for no one will ever
 repeat the attempt: it never happened in the past, and it will never
 happen in the future that any one should perform such a hardy feat or
 expose himself to such peril. and know that i admire you greatly for
 having executed what no one before ever dared to conceive. you will find
 me very kindly disposed, and loyal and courteous toward you. i am the king
 of this land, and offer you freely all my counsel and service; and i think
 i know pretty well what you have come here to seek. you come, i am sure,
 to seek the queen." "sire," he replies, "your surmise is correct; no other
 cause brings me here." "friend, you must suffer hardship to obtain her,"
 he replies; "and you are sorely wounded, as i see by the wounds and the
 flowing blood. you will not find him who brought her hither so generous as
 to give her up without a struggle; but you must tarry, and have your
 wounds cared for until they are completely healed. i will give you some of
 'the three marys' ointment,  and something still better, if
 it can be found, for i am very solicitous about your comfort and your
 recovery. and the queen is so confined that no mortal man has access to
 her—not even my son, who brought her here with him and who resents
 such treatment, for never was a man so beside himself and so desperate as
 he. but i am well disposed toward you, and will gladly give you, so help
 me god, all of which you stand in need. my son himself will not have such
 good arms but that i will give you some that are just as good, and a
 horse, too, such as you will need, though my son will be angry with me.
 despite the feelings of any one, i will protect you against all men. you
 will have no cause to fear any one excepting him who brought the queen
 here. no man ever menaced another as i have menaced him, and i came near
 driving him from my land, in my displeasure because he will not surrender
 her to you. to be sure, he is my son; but feel no concern, for unless he
 defeats you in battle, he can never do you the slightest harm against my
 will." "sire," he says, "i thank you. but i am losing time here which i do
 not wish to waste. i have no cause to complain, and have no wound which is
 paining me. take me where i can find him; for with such arms as i have, i
 am ready to divert myself by giving and receiving blows." "friend, you had
 better wait two or three weeks until your wounds are healed, for it would
 be well for you to tarry here at least two weeks, and not on any account
 could i allow it, or look on, while you fought in my presence with such
 arms and with such an outfit." and he replies: "with your permission, no
 other arms would be used than these, for i should prefer to fight with
 them, and i should not ask for the slightest postponement, adjournment or
 delay. however, in deference to you, i will consent to wait until
 to-morrow; but despite what any one may say, longer i will not wait." then
 the king assured him that all would be done as he wished; then he has the
 lodging-place prepared, and insistently requests his men, who are in the
 company, to serve him, which they do devotedly. and the king, who would
 gladly have made peace, had it been possible, went at once to his son and
 spoke to him like one who desires peace and harmony, saying: "fair son, be
 reconciled now with this knight without a fight! he has not come here to
 disport himself or to hunt or chase, but he comes in search of honour and
 to increase his fame and renown, and i have seen that he stands in great
 need of rest. if he had taken my advice, he would not have rashly
 undertaken, either this month or the next, the battle which he so greatly
 desires. if thou makest over the queen to him, dost thou fear any
 dishonour in the deed? have no fear of that, for no blame can attach to
 thee; rather is it wrong to keep that to which one has no rightful claim.
 he would gladly have entered the battle at once, though his hands and feet
 are not sound, but cut and wounded." meleagant answers his father thus:
 "you are foolish to be concerned. by the faith i owe st. peter, i will not
 take your advice in this matter. i should deserve to be drawn apart with
 horses, if i heeded your advice. if he is seeking his honour, so do i seek
 mine; if he is in search of glory, so am i; if he is anxious for the
 battle, so am i a hundred times more so than he." "i see plainly," says
 the king, "that thou art intent upon thy mad enterprise, and thou shalt
 have thy fill of it. since such is thy pleasure, to-morrow thou shalt try
 thy strength with the knight." "may no greater hardship ever visit me than
 that!" meleagant replies; "i would much rather it were to-day than
 to-morrow. just see how much more downcast i am than is usual! my eyes are
 wild, and my face is pale! i shall have no joy or satisfaction or any
 cause for happiness until i am actually engaged with him."
 (vv. -.) the king understands that further advice and prayers are
 of no avail, so reluctantly he leaves his son and, taking a good, strong
 horse and handsome arms, he sends them to him who well deserves them,
 together with a surgeon who was a loyal and christian man. there was in
 the world no more trusty man, and he was more skilled in the cure of
 wounds than all the doctors of montpeilier.  that
 night he treated the knight as best he could, in accordance with the
 king's command. already the news was known by the knights and damsels, the
 ladies and barons of all the country-side, and all through the night until
 daybreak strangers and friends were making long journeys from all the
 country round. when morning came, there was such a press before the castle
 that there was not room to move one's foot. and the king, rising early in
 his distress about the battle, goes directly to his son, who had already
 laced upon his head the helmet which was of poitiers make. no delay or
 peace is possible, for though the king did his best, his efforts are of no
 effect. in the middle of the castle-square, where all the people are
 assembled, the battle will be fought in compliance with the king's wish
 and command. the king sends at once for the stranger knight, and he is
 conducted to the grounds which were filled with people from the kingdom of
 logres. for just as people are accustomed to go to church to hear the
 organ on the annual feast-days of pentecost or christmas, so they had all
 assembled now. all the foreign maidens from king arthur's realm had fasted
 three days and gone barefoot in their shifts, in order that god might
 endow with strength and courage the knight who was to fight his adversary
 on behalf of the captives. very early, before prime had yet been sounded,
 both of the knights fully armed were led to the place, mounted upon two
 horses equally protected. meleagant was very graceful, alert, and shapely;
 the hauberk with its fine meshes, the helmet, and the shield hanging from
 his neck—all these became him well. all the spectators, however,
 favoured the other knight, even those who wished him ill, and they say
 that meleagant is worth nothing compared with him. as soon as they were
 both on the ground, the king comes and detains them as long as possible in
 an effort to make peace between them, but he is unable to persuade his
 son. then he says to them: "hold in your horses until i reach the top of
 the tower. it will be only a slight favour, if you will wait so long for
 me." then in sorrowful mood he leaves them and goes directly to the place
 where he knew he would find the queen. she had begged him the evening
 before to place her where she might have an unobstructed view of the
 battle; he had granted her the boon, and went now to seek and fetch her,
 for he was very anxious to show her honour and courtesy. he placed her at
 one window, and took his place at another window on her right. beside
 them, there were gathered there many knights and prudent dames and
 damsels, who were natives of that land; and there were many others, who
 were captives, and who were intent upon their orisons and prayers. those
 who were prisoners were praying for their lord, for to god and to him they
 entrusted their succour and deliverance. then the combatants without delay
 make all the people stand aside; then they clash the shields with their
 elbows, and thrust their arms into the straps, and spur at each other so
 violently that each sends his lance two arms' length through his
 opponent's shield, causing the lance to split and splinter like a flying
 spark. and the horses meet head on, clashing breast to breast, and the
 shields and helmets crash with such a noise that it seems like a mighty
 thunder-clap; not a breast-strap, girth, rein or surcingle remains
 unbroken, and the saddle-bows, though strong, are broken to pieces. the
 combatants felt no shame in falling to earth, in view of their mishaps,
 but they quickly spring to their feet, and without waste of threatening
 words rush at each other more fiercely than two wild boars, and deal great
 blows with their swords of steel like men whose hate is violent.
 repeatedly they trim the helmets and shining hauberks so fiercely that
 after the sword the blood spurts out. they furnished an excellent battle,
 indeed, as they stunned and wounded each other with their heavy, wicked
 blows. many fierce, hard, long bouts they sustained with equal honour, so
 that the onlookers could discern no advantage on either side. but it was
 inevitable that he who had crossed the bridge should be much weakened by
 his wounded hands. the people who sided with him were much dismayed, for
 they notice that his strokes are growing weaker, and they fear he will get
 the worst of it; it seemed to them that he was weakening, while meleagant
 was triumphing, and they began to murmur all around. but up at the window
 of the tower there was a wise maiden who thought within herself that the
 knight had not undertaken the battle either on her account or for the sake
 of the common herd who had gathered about the list, but that his only
 incentive had been the queen; and she thought that, if he knew that she
 was at the window seeing and watching him, his strength and courage would
 increase. and if she had known his name, she would gladly have called to
 him to look about him. then she came to the queen and said: "lady, for
 god's sake and your own as well as ours, i beseech you to tell me, if you
 know, the name of yonder knight, to the end that it may be of some help to
 him." "damsel," the queen replies, "you have asked me a question in which
 i see no hate or evil, but rather good intent; the name of the knight, i
 know, is lancelot of the lake."  "god,
 how happy and glad at heart i am!" the damsel says. then she leans forward
 and calls to him by name so loudly that all the people hear: "lancelot,
 turn about and see who is here taking note of thee!"
 (vv. -.) when lancelot heard his name, he was not slow to turn
 around: he turns and sees seated up there at the window of the tower her
 whom he desired most in the world to see. from the moment he caught sight
 of her, he did not turn or take his eyes and face from her, defending
 himself with backhand blows. and meleagant meanwhile attacked him as
 fiercely as he could, delighted to think that the other cannot withstand
 him now; and they of the country are well pleased too, while the
 foreigners are so distressed that they can no longer support themselves,
 and many of them fall to earth either upon their knees or stretched out
 prone; thus some are glad, and some distressed. then the damsel cried
 again from the window: "ah, lancelot, how is it that thou dost now conduct
 thyself so foolishly? once thou wert the embodiment of prowess and of all
 that is good, and i do not think god ever made a knight who could equal
 thee in valour and in worth. but now we see thee so distressed that thou
 dealest back-hand blows and fightest thy adversary, behind thy back. turn,
 so as to be on the other side, and so that thou canst face toward this
 tower, for it will help thee to keep it in view." then lancelot is so
 ashamed and mortified that he hates himself, for he knows full well that
 all have seen how, for some time past, he has had the worst of the fight.
 thereupon he leaps backward and so manoeuvres as to force meleagant into a
 position between him and the tower. meleagant makes every effort to regain
 his former position. but lancelot rushes upon him, and strikes him so
 violently upon his body and shield whenever he tries to get around him,
 that he compels him to whirl about two or three times in spite of himself.
 lancelot's strength and courage grow, partly because he has love's aid,
 and partly because he never hated any one so much as him with whom he is
 engaged. love and mortal hate, so fierce that never before was such hate
 seen, make him so fiery and bold that meleagant ceases to treat it as a
 jest and begins to stand in awe of him, for he had never met or known so
 doughty a knight, nor had any knight ever wounded or injured him as this
 one does. he is glad to get away from him, and he winces and sidesteps,
 fearing his blows and avoiding them. and lancelot does not idly threaten
 him, but drives him rapidly toward the tower where the queen was stationed
 on the watch. there upon the tower he did her the homage of his blows
 until he came so close that, if he advanced another step, he would lose
 sight of her. thus lancelot drove him back and forth repeatedly in
 whatever direction he pleased, always stopping before the queen, his lady,
 who had kindled the flame which compels him to fix his gaze upon her. and
 this same flame so stirred him against meleagant that he was enabled to
 lead and drive him wherever he pleased. in spite of himself he drives him
 on like a blind man or a man with a wooden leg. the king sees his son so
 hard pressed that he is sorry for him and he pities him, and he will not
 deny him aid and assistance if possible; but if he wishes to proceed
 courteously, he must first beg the queen's permission. so he began to say
 to her: "lady, since i have had you in my power, i have loved you and
 faithfully served and honoured you. i never consciously left anything
 undone in which i saw your honour involved; now repay me for what i have
 done. for i am about to ask you a favour which you should not grant unless
 you do so willingly. i plainly see that my son is getting the worst of
 this battle; i do not speak so because of the chagrin i feel, but in order
 that lancelot, who has him in his power, may not kill him. nor ought you
 to wish to see him killed; not because he has not wronged both you and
 him, but because i make the request of you: so tell him, please, to stop
 beating him. if you will, you can thus repay me for what i have done for
 you." "fair sire, i am willing to do so at your request," the queen
 replies; "had i mortal hatred for your son, whom it is true i do not love,
 yet you have served me so well that, to please you, i am quite willing
 that he should desist." these words were not spoken privately, but
 lancelot and meleagrant heard what was said. the man who is a perfect
 lover is always obedient and quickly and gladly does his mistress'
 pleasure. so lancelot was constrained to do his lady's will, for he loved
 more than pyramus,  if that were possible for any
 man to do. lancelot heard what was said, and as soon as the last word had
 issued from her mouth, "since you wish him to desist, i am willing that he
 should do so," lancelot would not have touched him or made a movement for
 anything, even if the other had killed him. he does not touch him or raise
 his hand. but meleagant, beside himself with rage and shame when he hears
 that it has been necessary to intercede in his behalf, strikes him with
 all the strength he can muster. and the king went down from the tower to
 upbraid his son, and entering the list he addressed him thus: "how now? is
 this becoming, to strike him when he is not touching thee? thou art too
 cruel and savage, and thy prowess is now out of place! for we all know
 beyond a doubt that he is thy superior." then meleagant, choking with
 shame, says to the king: "i think you must be blind! i do not believe you
 see a thing. any one must indeed be blind to think i am not better than
 he." "seek some one to believe thy words!" the king replies, "for all the
 people know whether thou speakest the truth or a lie. all of us know full
 well the truth." then the king bids his barons lead his son away, which
 they do at once in execution of his command: they led away meleagant. but
 it was not necessary to use force to induce lancelot to withdraw, for
 meleagant might have harmed him grievously, before he would have sought to
 defend himself. then the king says to his son: "so help me god, now thou
 must make peace and surrender the queen. thou must cease this quarrel once
 for all and withdraw thy claim." "that is great nonsense you have uttered!
 i hear you speak foolishly. stand aside! let us fight, and do not mix in
 our affairs!" but the king says he will take a hand, for he knows well
 that, were the fight to continue, lancelot would kill his son. "he kill
 me! rather would i soon defeat and kill him, if you would leave us alone
 and let us fight." then the king says: "so help me god, all that thou
 sayest is of no avail." "why is that?" he asks. "because i will not
 consent. i will not so trust in thy folly and pride as to allow thee to be
 killed. a man is a fool to court death, as thou dost in thy ignorance. i
 know well that thou hatest me because i wish to save thy life. god will
 not let me see and witness thy death, if i can help it, for it would cause
 me too much grief." he talks to him and reproves him until finally peace
 and good-will are restored. the terms of the peace are these: he will
 surrender the queen to lancelot, provided that the latter without
 reluctance will fight them again within a year of such time as he shall
 choose to summon him: this is no trial to lancelot. when peace is made,
 all the people press about, and it is decided that the battle shall be
 fought at the court of king arthur, who holds britain and cornwall in his
 sway: there they decide that it shall be. and the queen has to consent,
 and lancelot has to promise, that if meleagant can prove him recreant, she
 shall come back with him again without the interference of any one. when
 the queen and lancelot had both agreed to this, the arrangement was
 concluded, and they both retired and removed their arms. now the custom in
 the country was that when one issued forth, all the others might do so
 too. all called down blessings upon lancelot: and you may know that he
 must have felt great joy, as in truth he did. all the strangers assemble
 and rejoice over lancelot, speaking so as to be heard by him: "sire, in
 truth we were joyful as soon as we heard your name, for we felt sure at
 once that we should all be set free." there was a great crowd present at
 this glad scene, as each one strives and presses forward to touch him if
 possible. any one who succeeded in touching him was more delighted than he
 could tell. there was plenty of joy, and of sorrow too; those who were now
 set free rejoiced unrestrainedly; but meleagant and his followers have not
 anything they want, but are pensive, gloomy, and downcast. the king turns
 away from the list, taking with him lancelot, who begs him to take him to
 the queen. "i shall not fail to do so," the king replies; "for it seems to
 me the proper thing to do. and if you like, i will show you kay the
 seneschal." at this lancelot is so glad that he almost falls at his feet.
 then the king took him at once into the hall, where the queen had come to
 wait for him.
 (vv. -.) when the queen saw the king holding lancelot by the hand,
 she rose before the king, but she looked displeased with clouded brow, and
 she spoke not a word. "lady, here is lancelot come to see you," says the
 king; "you ought to be pleased and satisfied." "i, sire? he cannot please
 me. i care nothing about seeing him." "come now, lady," says the king who
 was very frank and courteous, "what induces you to act like this? you are
 too scornful toward a man who has served you so faithfully that he has
 repeatedly exposed his life to mortal danger on this journey for your
 sake, and who has defended and rescued you from my son meleagant who had
 deeply wronged you." "sire, truly he has made poor use of his time. i
 shall never deny that i feel no gratitude toward him." now lancelot is
 dumbfounded; but he replies very humbly like a polished lover: "lady,
 certainly i am grieved at this, but i dare not ask your reason." the queen
 listened as lancelot voiced his disappointment, but in order to grieve and
 confound him, she would not answer a single word, but returned to her
 room. and lancelot followed her with his eyes and heart until she reached
 the door; but she was not long in sight, for the room was close by. his
 eyes would gladly have followed her, had that been possible; but the
 heart, which is more lordly and masterful in its strength, went through
 the door after her, while the eyes remained behind weeping with the body.
 and the king said privily to him: "lancelot, i am amazed at what this
 means: and how it comes about that the queen cannot endure the sight of
 you, and that she is so unwilling to speak with you. if she is ever
 accustomed to speak with you, she ought not to be niggardly now or avoid
 conversation with you, after what you have done for her. now tell me, if
 you know, why and for what misdeed she has shown you such a countenance."
 "sire, i did not notice that just now; but she will not look at me or hear
 my words, and that distresses and grieves me much." "surely," says the
 king, "she is in the wrong, for you have risked your life for her. come
 away now, fair sweet friend, and we shall go to speak with the seneschal."
 "i shall be glad to do so," he replies. then they both go to the
 seneschal. as soon as lancelot came where he was, the seneschal's first
 exclamation was: "how thou hast shamed me!" "i? how so?" lancelot
 inquires; "tell me what disgrace have i brought upon you?" "a very great
 disgrace, for thou hast carried out what i could not accomplish, and thou
 hast done what i could not do."
 (vv. -.) then the king left them together in the room, and went
 out alone. and lancelot inquires of the seneschal if he has been badly
 off. "yes," he answers, "and i still am so. i was never more wretched than
 i am now. and i should have died a long time ago, had it not been for the
 king, who in his compassion has shown me so much gentleness and kindness
 that he willingly let me lack nothing of which i stood in need; but i was
 furnished at once with everything that i desired. but opposed to the
 kindness which he showed me, was meleagant his son, who is full of
 wickedness, and who summoned the physicians to him and bade them apply
 such ointments as would kill me. such a father and stepfather have i had!
 for when the king had a good plaster applied to my wounds in his desire
 that i should soon be cured, his treacherous son, wishing to put me to
 death, had it promptly taken off and some harmful salve applied. but i am
 very sure that the king was ignorant of this; he would not tolerate such
 base and murderous tricks. but you do not know how courteous he has been
 to my lady: no frontier tower since the time that noah built the ark was
 ever so carefully guarded, for he has guarded her so vigilantly that,
 though his son chafed under the restraint, he would nor let him see her
 except in the presence of the king himself. up to the present time the
 king in his mercy has shown her all the marks of consideration which she
 herself proposed. she alone had the disposition of her affairs. and the
 king esteemed her all the more for the loyalty she showed. but is it true,
 as i am told, that she is so angry with you that she has publicly refused
 to speak with you?" "you have been told the exact truth," lancelot
 replies, "but for god's sake, can you tell me why she is so displeased
 with me?" he replies that he does not know, and that he is greatly
 surprised at it. "well, let it be as she pleases," says lancelot, feeling
 his helplessness; "i must now take my leave, and i shall go to seek my
 lord gawain who has entered this land, and who arranged with me that he
 would proceed directly to the waterbridge." then, leaving the room, he
 appeared before the king and asked for leave to proceed in that direction.
 and the king willingly grants him leave to go. then those whom lancelot
 had set free and delivered from prison ask him what they are to do. and he
 replies: "all those who desire may come with me, and those who wish to
 stay with the queen may do so: there is no reason why they should
 accompany me." then all those, who so desire, accompany him, more glad and
 joyous than is their wont. with the queen remain her damsels who are light
 of heart, and many knights and ladies too. but there is not one of those
 who stay behind, who would not have preferred to return to his own country
 to staying there. but on my lord gawain's account, whose arrival is
 expected, the queen keeps them, saying that she will never stir until she
 has news of him.
 (vv. -.) the news spreads everywhere that the queen is free to go,
 and that all the other prisoners have been set at liberty and are free to
 go whenever it suits and pleases them. wherever the people of the land
 gather together, they ask each other about the truth of this report, and
 never talk of anything else. they are very much enraged that all the
 dangerous passes have been overcome, and that any one may come and go as
 he pleases. but when the natives of the country, who had not been present
 at the battle, learned how lancelot had been the victor, they all betook
 themselves to the place where they knew he must pass by, thinking that the
 king would be well pleased if they should seize lancelot and hale him back
 to him. all of his own men were without their arms, and therefore they
 were at a disadvantage when they saw the natives of the country coming
 under arms. it was not strange that they seized lancelot, who was without
 his arms. they lead him back prisoner, his feet lashed together beneath
 his horse. then his own men say: "gentlemen, this is an evil deed; for the
 king has given us his safe-conduct, and we are under his protection." but
 the others reply: "we do not know how that may be; but as we have taken
 you, you must return with us to court." the rumour, which swiftly flies
 and runs, reaches the king, that his men have seized lancelot and put him
 to death. when the king hears it, he is sorely grieved and swears angrily
 by his head that they who have killed him shall surely die for the deed;
 and that, if he can seize or catch them, it shall be their fate to be
 hanged, burned, or drowned. and if they attempt to deny their deed, he
 will not believe what they say, for they have brought him such grief and
 shame that he would be disgraced were vengeance not to be exacted from
 them; but he will be avenged without a doubt. the news of this spread
 until it reached the queen, who was sitting at meat. she almost killed
 herself on hearing the false report about lancelot, but she supposes it to
 be true, and therefore she is in such dismay that she almost loses the
 power to speak; but, because of those present, she forces herself to say:
 "in truth, i am sorry for his death, and it is no wonder that i grieve,
 for he came into this country for my sake, and therefore i should mourn
 for him." then she says to herself, so that the others should not hear,
 that no one need ask her to drink or eat, if it is true that he is dead,
 in whose life she found her own. then grieving she rises from the table,
 and makes her lament, but so that no one hears or notices her. she is so
 beside herself that she repeatedly grasps her throat with the desire to
 kill herself; but first she confesses to herself, and repents with
 self-reproach, blaming and censuring herself for the wrong she had done
 him, who, as she knew, had always been hers, and would still be hers, if
 he were alive. she is so distressed at the thought of her cruelty, that
 her beauty is seriously impaired. her cruelty and meanness affected her
 and marred her beauty more than all the vigils and fastings with which she
 afflicted herself. when all her sins rise up before her, she gathers them
 together, and as she reviews them, she repeatedly exclaims: "alas! of what
 was i thinking when my lover stood before me and i should have welcomed
 him, that i would not listen to his words? was i not a fool, when i
 refused to look at or speak to him? foolish indeed? rather was i base and
 cruel, so help me god. i intended it as a jest, but he did not take it so,
 and has not pardoned me. i am sure it was no one but me who gave him his
 death-blow. when he came before me smiling and expecting that i would be
 glad to see him and would welcome him, and when i would not look at him,
 was not that a mortal blow? when i refused to speak with him, then
 doubtless at one blow i deprived him of his heart and life. these two
 strokes have killed him, i am sure; no other bandits have caused his
 death. god! can i ever make amends for this murder and this crime? no,
 indeed; sooner will the rivers and the sea dry up. alas! how much better i
 should feel, and how much comfort i should take, if only once before he
 died i had held him in my arms! what? yes, certainly, quite unclad, in
 order the better to enjoy him. if he is dead, i am very wicked not to
 destroy myself. why? can it harm my lover for me to live on after he is
 dead, if i take no pleasure in anything but in the woe i bear for him? in
 giving myself up to grief after his death, the very woes i court would be
 sweet to me, if he were only still alive. it is wrong for a woman to wish
 to die rather than to suffer for her lover's sake. it is certainly sweet
 for me to mourn him long. i would rather be beaten alive than die and be
 at rest."
 (vv. -.) for two days the queen thus mourned for him without
 eating or drinking, until they thought she too would die. there are plenty
 of people ready to carry bad news rather than good. the news reaches
 lancelot that his lady and sweetheart is dead. you need have no doubt of
 the grief he felt; every one may feel sure that he was afflicted and
 overcome with grief. indeed, if you would know the truth, he was so
 downcast that he held his life in slight esteem. he wished to kill himself
 at once, but first he uttered a brief lament. he makes a running noose at
 one end of the belt he wore, and then tearfully communes thus with
 himself: "ah, death, how hast thou spied me out and undone me, when in the
 bloom of health! i am undone, and yet i feel no pain except the grief
 within my heart. this is a terrible mortal grief. i am willing that it
 should be so, and if god will, i shall die of it. then can i not die some
 other way, without god's consent? yes, if he will let me tie this noose
 around my neck. i think i can compel death, even against her will, to take
 my life. death, who covets only those who fear her, will not come to me;
 but my belt will bring her within my power, and as soon as she is mine,
 she will execute my desire. but, in truth, she will come too tardily for
 me, for i yearn to have her now!" then he delays and hesitates no longer,
 but adjusts his head within the noose until it rests about his neck; and
 in order that he may not fail to harm himself, he fastens the end of the
 belt tightly about the saddle-bow, without attracting the attention of any
 one. then he let himself slide to earth, intending his horse to drag him
 until he was lifeless, for he disdains to live another hour. when those
 who ride with him see him fallen to earth, they suppose him to be in a
 faint, for no one sees the noose which he had attached about his neck. at
 once they caught him in their arms and, on raising him, they found the
 noose which he had put around his neck and with which he sought to kill
 himself. they quickly cut the noose; but the noose had so hurt his throat
 that for some time he could not speak; the veins of his neck and throat
 are almost broken. now he could not harm himself, even had he wished to do
 so; however, he is grieved that they have laid hands on him, and he almost
 burns up with rage, for willingly would he have killed himself had no one
 chanced to notice him. and now when he cannot harm himself, he cries: "ah,
 vile and shameless death! for god's sake, why hadst thou not the power and
 might to kill me before my lady died? i suppose it was because thou
 wouldst not deign to do what might be a kindly deed. if thou didst spare
 me, it must be attributed to thy wickedness. ah, what kind of service and
 kindness is that! how well hast thou employed them here! a curse upon him
 who thanks thee or feels gratitude for such a service! i know not which is
 more my enemy: life, which detains me, or death, which will not slay me.
 each one torments me mortally; and it serves me right, so help me god,
 that in spite of myself i should still live on. for i ought to have killed
 myself as soon as my lady the queen showed her hate for me; she did not do
 it without cause, but she had some good reason, though i know not what it
 is. and if i had known what it was before her soul went to god, i should
 have made her such rich amends as would have pleased her and gained her
 mercy. god! what could my crime have been? i think she must have known
 that i mounted upon the cart. i do not know what other cause she can have
 to blame me. this has been my undoing. if this is the reason of her hate,
 god! what harm could this crime do? any one who would reproach me for such
 an act never knew what love is, for no one could mention anything which,
 if prompted by love, ought to be turned into a reproach. rather,
 everything that one can do for his lady-love is to be regarded as a token
 of his love and courtesy. yet, i did not do it for my 'lady-love'. i know
 not by what name to call her, whether 'lady-love', or not. i do not dare
 to call her by this name. but i think i know this much of love: that if
 she loved me, she ought not to esteem me less for this crime, but rather
 call me her true lover, inasmuch as i regarded it as an honour to do all
 love bade me do, even to mount upon a cart. she ought to ascribe this to
 love; and this is a certain proof that love thus tries his devotees and
 thus learns who is really his. but this service did not please my lady, as
 i discovered by her countenance. and yet her lover did for her that for
 which many have shamefully reproached and blamed him, though she was the
 cause of it; and many blame me for the part i have played, and have turned
 my sweetness into bitterness. in truth, such is the custom of those who
 know so little of love, that even honour they wash in shame. but whoever
 dips honour into shame, does not wash it, but rather sullies it. but they,
 who maltreat him so, are quite ignorant of love; and he, who fears not his
 commands, boasts himself very superior to him. for unquestionably he fares
 well who obeys the commands of love, and whatever he does is pardonable,
 but he is the coward who does not dare."
 (vv. -.) thus lancelot makes his lament, and his men stand
 grieving by his side, keeping hold of him and guarding him. then the news
 comes that the queen is not dead. thereupon lancelot at once takes
 comfort, and if his grief for her death had before been intense and deep,
 now his joy for her life was a hundred thousand times as great. and when
 they arrived within six or seven leagues of the castle where king bademagu
 was, grateful news of lancelot was told him, how he was alive and was
 coming hale and hearty, and this news the king was glad to hear. he did a
 very courteous thing in going at once to appraise the queen. and she
 replies: "fair sire, since you say so, i believe it is true, but i assure
 you that, if he were dead, i should never be happy again. all my joy would
 be cut off, if a knight had been killed in my service."
 (vv. -.) then the king leaves her, and the queen yearns ardently
 for the arrival of her lover and her joy. she has no desire this time to
 bear him any grudge. but rumour, which never rests but runs always
 unceasingly, again reaches the queen to the effect that lancelot would
 have killed himself for her sake, if he had had the chance. she is happy
 at the thought that this is true, but she would not have had it happen so
 for anything, for her sorrow would have been too great. thereupon lancelot
 arrived in haste.  as soon as the king sees him,
 he runs to kiss and embrace him. he feels as if he ought to fly, borne
 along by the buoyancy of his joy. but his satisfaction is cut short by
 those who had taken and bound his guest, and the king tells them they have
 come in an evil hour, for they shall all be killed and confounded. then
 they made answer that they thought he would have it so. "it is i whom you
 have insulted in doing your pleasure. he has no reason to complain," the
 king replies; "you have not shamed him at all, but only me who was
 protecting him. however you look at it, the shame is mine. but if you
 escape me now, you will see no joke in this." when lancelot hears his
 wrath, he puts forth every effort to make peace and adjust matters; when
 his efforts have met with success, the king takes him away to see the
 queen. this time the queen did not lower her eyes to the ground, but she
 went to meet him cheerfully, honouring him all she could, and making him
 sit down by her side. then they talked together at length of all that was
 upon their hearts, and love furnished them with so much to say that topics
 did not lack. and when lancelot sees how well he stands, and that all he
 says finds favour with the queen, he says to her in confidence: "lady, i
 marvel greatly why you received me with such a countenance when you saw me
 the day before yesterday, and why you would not speak a word to me: i
 almost died of the blow you gave me, and i had not the courage to dare to
 question you about it, as i now venture to do. i am ready now, lady, to
 make amends, when you have told me what has been the crime which has
 caused me such distress." then the queen replies: "what? did you not
 hesitate for shame to mount the cart? you showed you were loath to get in,
 when you hesitated for two whole steps. that is the reason why i would
 neither address nor look at you." "may god save me from such a crime
 again," lancelot replies, "and may god show me no mercy, if you were not
 quite right! for god's sake, lady, receive my amends at once, and tell me,
 for god's sake, if you can ever pardon me." "friend, you are quite
 forgiven," the queen replies; "i pardon you willingly." "thank you for
 that, lady," he then says; "but i cannot tell you here all that i should
 like to say; i should like to talk with you more at leisure, if possible."
 then the queen indicates a window by her glance rather than with her
 finger, and says: "come through the garden to-night and speak with me at
 yonder window, when every one inside has gone to sleep. you will not be
 able to get in: i shall be inside and you outside: to gain entrance will
 be impossible. i shall be able to touch you only with my lips or hand,
 but, if you please, i will stay there until morning for love of you. our
 bodies cannot be joined, for close beside me in my room lies kay the
 seneschal, who is still suffering from his wounds. and the door is not
 open, but is tightly closed and guarded well. when you come, take care to
 let no spy catch sight of you." "lady," says he, "if i can help it, no spy
 shall see me who might think or speak evil of us." then, having agreed
 upon this plan, they separate very joyfully.
 (vv. -.) lancelot leaves the room in such a happy frame that all
 his past troubles are forgotten. but he was so impatient for the night to
 come that his restlessness made the day seem longer than a hundred
 ordinary days or than an entire year. if night had only come, he would
 gladly have gone to the trysting place. dark and sombre night at last won
 its struggle with the day, and wrapped it up in its covering, and laid it
 away beneath its cloak. when he saw the light of day obscured, he
 pretended to be tired and worn, and said that, in view of his protracted
 vigils, he needed rest. you, who have ever done the same, may well
 understand and guess that he pretends to be tired and goes to bed in order
 to deceive the people of the house; but he cared nothing about his bed,
 nor would he have sought rest there for anything, for he could not have
 done so and would not have dared, and furthermore he would not have cared
 to possess the courage or the power to do so. soon he softly rose, and was
 pleased to find that no moon or star was shining, and that in the house
 there was no candle, lamp, or lantern burning. thus he went out and looked
 about, but there was no one on the watch for him, for all thought that he
 would sleep in his bed all night. without escort or company he quickly
 went out into the garden, meeting no one on the way, and he was so
 fortunate as to find that a part of the garden-wall had recently fallen
 down. through this break he passes quickly and proceeds to the window,
 where he stands, taking good care not to cough or sneeze, until the queen
 arrives clad in a very white chemise. she wore no cloak or coat, but had
 thrown over her a short cape of scarlet cloth and shrew-mouse fur. as soon
 as lancelot saw the queen leaning on the window-sill behind the great iron
 bars, he honoured her with a gentle salute. she promptly returned his
 greeting, for he was desirous of her, and she of him. their talk and
 conversation are not of vulgar, tiresome affairs. they draw close to one
 another, until each holds the other's hand. but they are so distressed at
 not being able to come together more completely, that they curse the iron
 bars. then lancelot asserts that, with the queen's consent, he will come
 inside to be with her, and that the bars cannot keep him out. and the
 queen replies: "do you not see how the bars are stiff to bend and hard to
 break? you could never so twist, pull or drag at them as to dislodge one
 of them." "lady," says he, "have no fear of that. it would take more than
 these bars to keep me out. nothing but your command could thwart my power
 to come to you. if you will but grant me your permission, the way will
 open before me. but if it is not your pleasure, then the way is so
 obstructed that i could not possibly pass through." "certainly," she says,
 "i consent. my will need not stand in your way; but you must wait until i
 retire to my bed again, so that no harm may come to you, for it would be
 no joke or jest if the seneschal, who is sleeping here, should wake up on
 hearing you. so it is best for me to withdraw, for no good could come of
 it, if he should see me standing here." "go then, lady," he replies; "but
 have no fear that i shall make any noise. i think i can draw out the bars
 so softly and with so little effort that no one shall be aroused."
 (vv. -.) then the queen retires, and he prepares to loosen the
 window. seizing the bars, he pulls and wrenches them until he makes them
 bend and drags them from their places. but the iron was so sharp that the
 end of his little finger was cut to the nerve, and the first joint of the
 next finger was torn; but he who is intent upon something else paid no
 heed to any of his wounds or to the blood which trickled down. though the
 window is not low, lancelot gets through it quickly and easily. first he
 finds kay asleep in his bed, then he comes to the bed of the queen, whom
 he adores and before whom he kneels, holding her more dear than the relic
 of any saint. and the queen extends her arms to him and, embracing him,
 presses him tightly against her bosom, drawing him into the bed beside her
 and showing him every possible satisfaction; her love and her heart go out
 to him. it is love that prompts her to treat him so; and if she feels
 great love for him, he feels a hundred thousand times as much for her. for
 there is no love at all in other hearts compared with what there is in
 his; in his heart love was so completely embodied that it was niggardly
 toward all other hearts. now lancelot possesses all he wants, when the
 queen voluntarily seeks his company and love, and when he holds her in his
 arms, and she holds him in hers. their sport is so agreeable and sweet, as
 they kiss and fondle each other, that in truth such a marvellous joy comes
 over them as was never heard or known. but their joy will not be revealed
 by me, for in a story, it has no place. yet, the most choice and
 delightful satisfaction was precisely that of which our story must not
 speak. that night lancelot's joy and pleasure were very great. but, to his
 sorrow, day comes when he must leave his mistress' side. it cost him such
 pain to leave her that he suffered a real martyr's agony. his heart now
 stays where the queen remains; he has not the power to lead it away, for
 it finds such pleasure in the queen that it has no desire to leave her: so
 his body goes, and his heart remains. but enough of his body stays behind
 to spot and stain the sheets with the blood which has fallen from his
 fingers. full of sighs and tears, lancelot leaves in great distress. he
 grieves that no time is fixed for another meeting, but it cannot be.
 regretfully he leaves by the window through which he had entered so
 happily. he was so badly wounded in the fingers that they were in sorry,
 state; yet he straightened the bars and set them in their place again, so
 that from neither side, either before or behind, was it evident that any
 one had drawn out or bent any of the bars. when he leaves the room, he
 bows and acts precisely as if he were before a shrine; then he goes with a
 heavy heart, and reaches his lodgings without being recognised by any one.
 he throws himself naked upon his bed without awaking any one, and then for
 the first time he is surprised to notice the cuts in his fingers; but he
 is not at all concerned, for he is very sure that the wound was caused by
 dragging the window bars from the wall. therefore he was not at all
 worried, for he would rather have had both arms dragged from his body than
 not enter through the window. but he would have been very angry and
 distressed, if he had thus injured and wounded himself under any other
 circumstances.
 (vv. -.) in the morning, within her curtained room, the queen had
 fallen into a gentle sleep; she had not noticed that her sheets were
 spotted with blood, but she supposed them to be perfectly white and clean
 and presentable. now meleagant, as soon as he was dressed and ready, went
 to the room where the queen lay. he finds her awake, and he sees the
 sheets spotted with fresh drops of blood, whereupon he nudges his
 companions and, suspicious of some mischief, looks at the bed of kay the
 seneschal, and sees that his sheets are blood-stained too, for you must
 know that in the night his wounds had begun to bleed afresh. then he said:
 "lady, now i have found the evidence that i desired. it is very true that
 any man is a fool to try to confine a woman: he wastes his efforts and his
 pains. he who tries to keep her under guard loses her sooner than the man
 who takes no thought of her. a fine watch, indeed, has been kept by my
 father, who is guarding you on my behalf! he has succeeded in keeping you
 from me, but, in spite of him, kay the seneschal has looked upon you last
 night, and has done what he pleased with you, as can readily be proved."
 "what is that?" she asks. "since i must speak, i find blood on your
 sheets, which proves the fact. i know it and can prove it, because i find
 on both your sheets and his the blood which issued from his wounds: the
 evidence is very strong." then the queen saw on both beds the bloody
 sheets, and marvelling, she blushed with shame and said: "so help me god,
 this blood which i see upon my sheets was never brought here by kay, but
 my nose bled during the night, and i suppose it must be from my nose." in
 saying so, she thinks she tells the truth. "by my head," says meleagant,
 "there is nothing in what you say. swearing is of no avail, for you are
